When we got in there, we found a small baby (about 1 year) lying on the floor and bleeding profusely. We tried to do what we could to stop the bleeding; however, the baby died. We left the room to call the police, and just as we came out of the room we saw a crowd of men bringing back the man who fired the shot. Right after this I woke up."

At any rate, she seemed physically desirable to me in the dream, so I purposely waited until most of the others had gone home or had fallen asleep -- was dimly aware of the fact that the party had worn out its welcome, and the host wanted us to leave (it must have been 3:00 or 4:00). We finally got up to leave; as I was the only one who had a car, I was obliged to take the others home. I intentionally did not take this girl home before I dropped off the others. Then we parked. I placed my arm about her, and noticing the disgusting leer of sheer physical desire on her face, I recalled thinking that I was certainly a dirty rascal intending to make love to this girl merely because her sister (allegedly my true love) was not there."

Patient, often violent, was lying on a roll-away table (similar to type used in operating rooms). I felt a vague sensation of fear and lack of confidence in my ability to handle the task in event of an emergency, but I agreed to carry out the instructions. We entered the elevator, with me in the elevator was another attendant (not considered dependable by me) and a trustee patient. We began to descend, and I began to wonder what would happen if the bottom fell out of the elevator; suddenly the floor of the elevator opened (similar to the bomb bays in an airplane), and we all fell through. All of us, except the patient, managed to hang onto ledges in the elevator shaft; the other attendant and I were hanging on to the patient at the same time. Both the patient and the trustee were hysterical, shouting, crying, and struggling violently; I remember a definite feeling of disgust, and I thought to myself, isn't this typical of human beings. You can never depend on them for anything -- not even to the extent of making their personal rescue easier."

My sister then approached, glanced at the damage to my car, and began to insist loudly that our parents would not help to pay for the repairs.

My girlfriend greeted them cordially and entered, leaving me standing outside. As I had little else to do, I engaged myself in conversation with her sister. An old man came and stood near us silently for a while; then he asked in a friendly manner, who I was. Immediately I introduced myself to him and found then that he was my girlfriend's father."

I quickly went back to the rest of the group to stand off the attack. I took my rifle and began shooting at the enemy. I shot them with no effect and I found that I had not taken the safety off the gun. Now I was out of ammunition, as I borrowed some from the soldiers around me. Now when I shot, the advancing enemy would be killed. The other soldiers now seemed to be doing very little and I was defending the whole group.

I had no moral compunctions about killing them, but a feeling of to kill or be killed, along with a feeling that they were making me kill them. Finally I had killed enough so that the remainder retreated. As soon as the enemy retreated, three men came up to me and said to one another, \"this is the one,\" pinning a medal on me. I felt good but that turned to fear, like now every one of the enemy would be out to get me. Our group then retreated back to our house. A new group of the enemy attacked from the rear, but I saw them soon enough to give warning and avert a surprise attack. At this point I killed a man with my bare hands (a knife that is).

Ah, a barrel with a bung-hole, (I couldn't be that hard up) and began to carry it out of the barn. Suddenly the farm woman saw me and told me to put down the barrel. The firmness of the tones of her voice hastened my putting down of the barrel.

We talked and somehow we fell in love. Then the king came in to the hall. People hustled around. They had on beautiful clothes and the women had many jewels on too. I gave this girl a beautiful ring and all of a sudden the people were gone and the girl and I were alone in a different room. The king came in. He didn't look familiar, but he was tall and nice-looking. He carried a beautiful robe with pearls on it and trimmed with white ermine fur. He put it around my shoulders and then put a crown on my head and said I was his son and now I was king. Then I went back to the girl. The people left the room and I took the ring I had given her and gave her a large diamond surrounded by three sapphires and some little diamonds. Then I put the other ring on the finger next to it and said that it would be an engagement ring until we were married."

The bartender said, \"Oh, no,\" and took it away from him. I then took the double, passed it down as if it were water, picked up my derby and umbrella and started on home. A little further on I passed a beat-up old building that seemed to house both second-hand and new stores. I went in to look around. The first place I stopped was the sports department and looked at golf clubs, golf bag, and golf balls. The bag was an exact replica of the one I wanted, had a zipper all the way down and was big enough to cover me completely. Since I had no money I said I would be back. The owners, who seemed to be one big family, told me to look around. I went into the toy and fabric shops. Lastly I went into a beverage shop where an old man, head of the family, was making coffee. He asked me to have some and I said, \"Yes.\" He was just making a mixture of different brews when I woke up."

I was in charge of fueling our vehicles although I only had a few barrels of gas and oil. We had huge stores of war surplus weapons and a few new [illegible]. Our ace in the hole was a huge ape about 30 feet tall and very powerful. As we were transporting him to a new scene of battle his specially built truck went over a cliff and the ape broke loose and became uncontrollable. He chased another friend (a pal in real life, 20, who just now comes into the dream) and me. We began climbing a huge tree. My friend was tired and kept slipping. We finally got to the top but my friend slipped and fell to his apparent death below. I descended and with a few friends performed an operation on the ape and restored him to his former human form. He became our friend. He had been previously turned into this monster by someone we knew nothing of."

I first climbed a small tree but found it was not safe enough so I came down and began to climb a large tent pole which I had not noticed before. As I did so I had a nocturnal emission and awoke."

I did. Suddenly she seemed to be stripped to the waist. She had small pointed breasts and I thought of her fiance sucking the nipples. I thought if he can do it so can I."

I was sitting at the breakfast table half-sleeping and he yelled at me for being out so late the last night. I yelled back. From there we talked about school and he said he objected to my taking such useless courses as philosophy. I got very angry and screamed back at him, asserting my rights. My mother told me fearfully that I should not excite him, but I did not care. He had already gotten a pressure on his heart and had to take a pill for it."

I happened to be iwth a friend of mine who is of recent times and had no association with the girl at any time. The three of us drove all over and I never seemed to get anywhere, but we were always driving. I remember it was raining and the three of us would stop and walk a while. The three of us all were on the approximate same age. I remember the girl was rather scantily clad. The main determining thing about the dream was that the girl was far more attractive in the dream than in real life, particularly her legs. We seemed to be getting nowhere. The dream more or less fizzled without anything happening but us walking and driving in the rain."

I was quite worried and rushed home. I was going to call the girl, but as I thought the matter over I was quite worried. I didn't know what to do. I remember my father was very mad at me. I kept trying to figure a way out of the problem, but I couldn't. I woke up in the morning very much worried until I realized it was a dream."

She wanted to go right home, but I wanted to make violent love. We had an argument about it. She said we couldn't if I was going to get sick everytime we drank beer.

The next, I believe we were both floating in the clouds completely nude. We were pleasantly talking and laughing. We were dancing and singing suddenly, extremely happy.
