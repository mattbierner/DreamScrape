            "content": "We were at my house, and these people from up north came to visit us. There were approximately 4 women and my girl, and these women constituted my aunt and her friend and my girl and her mother. My girl didn't know my aunt being they weren't related. So they came to our house at night and supposedly they came a year ago too, but this time they came they expected to go out and my father refused to go out. So we were all at the supper table, and they were hoping to go out to drive around the town, but my father wouldn't go. So I got real mad and went in the bedroom. I was sleeping on the floor. Everyone else was mad, but I tried to get attention, but nobody would listen to me. They just went in and out, in and out. So finally everybody wanted me to get dressed, to put on some other clothes. So I was outside taking some clothes off the line and I went back inside the house, and they almost decided to go out. So I was in the bedroom and I couldn't make up my mind what kind of shoes to put on. They were either brown loafers or black loafers. And then we ate supper. We had some kind of meatball stuff. So we were eating supper and my girl was mad at me, and her mother didn't say anything about my aunt and uncle. My 2 aunts were mad at my father. They said they weren't going to come again and all kinds of stuff like that. They said that I caused half the trouble. So I just went back inside and I was looking at some more shoes in my closet. I went back into the bedroom to look for more shoes in my closet. It was mentioned in the dream, the beginning of the dream, that the same incident occurred a year ago in the dream when everyone came in to visit my father and he wouldn't go out. When I got mad and went in the bedroom, I was half laying on the bed and half on the floor. My feet were on the floor, and I couldn't lay on the bed completely because there were a lot of cameras, a lot of fur coats and other articles of clothing. During the supper time my father was wearing a white shirt and a blue pair of working pants and white socks and a blue pair of canvas shoes. The whole evening my father was quite satisfied and he couldn't understand why everyone was mad at him was because he didn't want to go out. When I was in the bedroom I was just retreating from where they were in the livingroom because I was sick of the whole argument that they were having and someone came in and told me to go outside and put some other clothes on so we could get ready and go out which we eventually didn't. Some of the specific things that were mentioned were someone told me that I may as well come into the living room and eat my supper. The base of the whole dream and my general feeling was that everyone was mad at my father for not going out because everyone expected to go out, but he just didn't see any reason why it was necessary. He just wanted to stay home. Someone said distinctly that they weren't going to come again, and they didn't even have a decent supper. The setting of the dream was our house, but it's not our real house like it was in real life. It was just our house in the dream, but the clothes line was the clothes line like we had in our real life."

            "content": "I was on Flagler Street by my house and I was going toward my house in my car. Then I stopped the car and saw all these girls that were on the corner. They had real short short short on, real sexy looking. They were young. They were only about 16 or 17, and I was just looking at them. One of them, she had a pair of greenish shorts on. She was by this street sign that said what street it was. She started doing pushups on the sidewalk, and they were looking at me and sort of giggling, all kinds of stuff. So I crossed Flagler Street and it seemed that I ended up at the dormitories of the University of Miami. There was a bunch of my friends there that were in a fraternity, and I was talking to them about these girls. They were all eating cake. I didn't feel like cake, so I wanted to get some beer. So I asked a friend of mine how the beer was, and he said it was alright. So one of them went next door to get some beer, but where they went was a U Tote Em, which is right by my house again. So this dream went from the university to, in other words, the U tote Em was right by the dorm, but it was actually right by my house. So they went over there by the dorm, but it was actually right by my house. So they went over there and we had beer and were just sitting around, just talking. Then the scene seems to have changed and I was with a good friend of mine who's been in some of my other dreams. He isn't in the fraternity. All of my fraternity brothers seem to have disappeared and we were in a show. We were sitting in a show and the lobby was very large, a large lobby. There were these girls sitting in the movie yelling at us, giggling and all that. We just left. Then we found ourselves back in this U Tote Em store which is like a 7-11, but it seems to have changed because there are little counters, booths where you could sit down. So he was sitting with his girlfriend. She went to Barry College. We were drinking beer again and he kept bothering her so they were just talking around, talking. So then the scene changed again, and I was sitting with him alone. She wasn't there. This girl that I seen around, I wouldn't know her name, she was a prostitute, and she charged about $10. So there was this new apt. house across the street from the U tote Em. So she sat down with my friend and I. She was sitting next to my friend. I was going to pay the $10, but he was just sitting there talking. So we had a bill that came to $10, or his bill came to $10. There was a man next to us and he was in charge of a cash register and he was just sitting. He wasn't at a counter. He was at another table. So she took this bill over to him. She took my friend's bill and he crossed out $10 and he put $8. This was to do him a favor so she could drum up business and gave him a break on the beer. This bill I can remember vividly. It had $10 crossed out on the bottom and I think it was 800,000. She had 8 and 5 zeroes, but it was supposed to be $8. I don't know why there were quite a few zeroes down there. She was there and I was there. I was getting ready to go with her. Then she scene seemed to change again. We were in the same place, but my friend's girl was back and they were just talking. She was drinking beer again. We didn't seem to move from our seats. It was just a different person there. That was the end of the dream except I can remember this prostitute. I don't know who she was. She had a yellow dress, a real bright yellow and that was it."

I was with a girl of whom is familiar, but I can't place her. We came upon this tribe of people. They were white, with features like a North American and spoke English. There were 2 men about to be executed in this dream. There were 2 executioners, 1 man and one woman. They were familiar, but I didn't know their names. The people being executed were not familiar at all. The method of execution was sort of gruesome. First they cut one arm off then a leg, then the other arm and leg. Then they cut the body in 2 pieces lengthways (no blood or screams). While this was being done, orders were given on how to do it. All I could hear was a voice, a female's, giving instructions. The girl and I left, we were free to go and were not captives. We began to walk down the road, and behind us were the 2 executioners carrying the remains of the 2 dead. The woods along the side of the road seemed to be full of people. In the woods we then saw the 2 men that were just executed. We then found out that the 2 men that were killed were just dummies, but they were very lifelike, but no one was killed. To the girl and I, this was not a funny joke. So as we continued, we came to a bus station. This was odd because we were in the woods. So we prepared to give the bus driver money for the tickets and the dream ended."

I was in the library at school, University of Miami, with a friend of mine, and we were sitting there joking around. We weren't studying very hard, and we were looking at all the girls and laughing. We decided to read the paper. So we read the school paper, and we were both reading the sports section. In the sports section there was a cartoon about this friend of ours, that we knew. We didn't know him too well, but we just knew him to say hello. Anyway this friend was in reality very short and very fat. He was about five feet and he weighed about 200 lbs. But in the cartoon it made him look very handsome and in the caption of the cartoon it showed him in a basketball uniform and his name is Richard Fife. It said under the cartoon Richard Fife is a tall man with the girls. So we saw this cartoon and we really began to laugh because this kid is so ugly. He's not ugly, but he's just short and fat. So we were sitting there laughing about that and we continued reading the paper and watching people walk around. I looked at a photograph and it was supposedly of a basketball game, but all the players had dark uniforms on, and I think it was Purdue, the school that the University of Miami was playing. A few of the players while they were playing basketball, they had footballs in their hands--about three of them. About three more had basketballs. It was just a picture, but it looked like they were playing with these balls. The dream ended when I was looking at these pictures and talking to my friend."

It's right out here on Ponce. He wanted to write me out a ticket for $25.43, and as I woke up, I was arguing with him that I hadn't gone thru the red light. That's about all. There was some day residue. I almost stopped at this bar tonight. They have all drinks for 35 cents. We talked about going in there. This all happened at night."

One was a tire on a car, just a close-up of the tire spinning. I was talking to someone in the background. It was just a close-up of the tire spinning. The next picture was a station wagon, a Chrysler station wagon, green, on a turnpike. The Chrysler station wagon, I think, probably comes from my roommate's parents. They're down here and they have one. It's not green though. Theirs is a metallic gray. Perhaps the tires come from the fact that I just put tires on the car yesterday. I remember the car was full. I can't say for sure who the people in the car are."

I'm just not going to go to sleep.\" Roger had been waiting for me all night on the machine. He was rather happy to quit too. The scene then shifts to the kitchen. The kitchen is my grandmother's kitchen, and Roger was cooking. I got a cup of coffee and then came over and talked to him, explaining why I couldn't seem to get to sleep. I told him I couldn't sleep because I was trying to go to sleep and that never works. I told him the last time I tried that was at a hunting lodge three years ago and I hadn't slept all night. I tried that. Anyway, what Roger was cooking, I remember a pile of brown sugar and apples. At first I thought it was going to be an apple pie or something like that. Also it was a pile of chocolate, chocolate with almonds in it, and he was making some dish out of this. It had a foreign name to it. He told me what it was,  but I can't remember what it was."

Now this is one feature we do not have on a Fuller mop. She wasn't saying much, but she acted pleased at the mop. Then the scene shifted, and this next thing I was selling I have no idea what it was, but anyways it was a, it looked like a bathing cap, but it was lined with a sponge, sponge rubber material, a white sponge rubber material. It was about a quarter of an inch thick and on the outside of it, it was just black rubber. Again, I have no idea what it was. There was one other thing. I was selling a, I guess it was more of work clothes or something for cleaning up a house or that you could wear, to a man. He was about my age, I guess. He was a little perturbed at me selling it to him because whenever I try to sell anything to him, he always bought it, and he really didn't want to buy anything."

            "content": "I also had another dream. This took place at the university, definitely not ours, in which Dr. Munson, the Social Science Director, out at the university, was in charge of it. He was a pretty popular man and every time he showed up somewhere, there was a big crowd that gathered and TV cameras and people trying to ask him opinions. All this happening. The scene opened onto a thing like this. After this we went back to our room, my roommates and I, none of which are people I know in actual life, and we were sort of talking about this and pretty soon we noticed a big commotion in the hall a few rooms down. We went down there, and this is a big room, and Dr. Munson was in there with a whole bunch of people. We walked in and thought we would try to talk to him or something. We couldn't get anywhere near him. Well, we talked to a few other people in the room and everybody was quite surprised at me because I came in with my electrodes on. Evidently a little bit of the lab here somehow got mixed into my dream. This was a big joke and it was quite funny to everybody, and the TV camera switched around to take a picture of me to tell them my story. Then the scene shifts and we went back and were watching the TV set for while. Dr. Munson was giving out a few awards. He was giving out some awards for achievement in sports and all that. I sort of hoped I was going to get one, but I didn't. I knew I couldn't. Then the scene shifts again and Dr. Munson and a few of his close friends or aides are in part of the school building, which they are thinking of replacing or modernizing. This very strongly represents the courtyard at Viscaya with Dr. Munson standing up in one of the corners on a upper level. At the time it was full of students, about 5,000 probably were in the lower courtyard and in the upper seated around, and they were talking about, as I said, modernizing this building. Dr. Munson then got up and assured all the students that they would not at all be cheap in this modernizing and they would give them the best possible building that money could buy. The scene shifts again. It's night and I'm in somebody else's room, I don't know whose. I've got a rope ladder in there that I've taken off one of the playing fields around the college. I guess I've stolen it. Anyway, I'm thinking of throwing it out the window and climbing down. I'm on the second or third floor of this building. I'm looking out the window and have the ladder in my hand. A light hits me in the eyes. I drop to the floor. I don't know why. I just drop to the floor. It's a reflex action. I was behind the bed, and I take a peek out the window and it's a policeman. I don't think I really have too much to be afraid of from the policeman. The rope ladder doesn't worry me much. I can always hide that. So I stand up, take a look at him, and the light hits me again in the eyes. So I just stand there and he comes jumping out and he's got a pistol in his hand, points it right at me, asks me what I was doing. I said, \"I'm not doing anything, just looking at you.\" He says, \"Alright, stay right there. I want to talk to you.\" I do and I keep the rope ladder under some paper and pretty soon he comes up, and I let him in, and he's saying he's sorry he frightened me that way. He said they were looking for somebody who was stealing books or something. I said ok. He never asked for an I.D. card or anything. He left. This is about then where the dream ended. On this dream again I don't have any idea where it came from None of the characters are familiar except Dr. Munson. I really can't say what the meaning of it is either. Both of these last two dreams were for the most part pleasant. I do remember some color in the turkey and the rough grouse in the 1st dream. They were natural, which is a brown with some red, a beautiful green, just a bunch of colors. I can't really describe it. Take a look at a picture of a wild turkey sometime. The only color I can remember in the other dream is the color of my wires. That's the only thing I was conscious of. The dream involving Dr. Munson was actually the first one I dreamt, and it seemed to last quite a long time. I would say at least 20 minutes. The other one was shorter, perhaps 10 or even 15."

I talked with her I think for three quarters of an hour the first day I went out. I thought, \"Boy, I'm really going to get a sale when I go back.\" I was real nice to her. She said she was quite sure she would buy something the next time I came around.  Well, I knocked on her door and she was very happy to see me. She let me in and said, \"Sit down.\" She started right over to a table, and I thought, \"Oh boy, this is wonderful. She's going to have me write out orders.\" Then she started talking about a car accident she was in, how she was getting insurance now. This rather perturbed me because I thought I was going to get a sale, and so I began to try to sell her some things and remind her of things she might need. She sort of looked at me and laughed, and said there wasn't a thing she needed, and I wasn't going to get a sale at all. She went on and I finally made the excuse that I had to get to work because I didn't make money that day. She said ok and went next door to her daughter's apartment. Now I was just going out as she opened the door to this apartment. It was dark, Victorian decorated. Her daughter was going to the supermarket, and some woman asked her to buy her a brush, a hair brush. I was about halfway down the stairs at this time, and this got me a little mad. I said, \"What's wrong with a Fuller brush?\" She said, \"Oh, they don't make the kind I like.\" I said, \"We make three kinds. Have you tried them all or seen them all?\" She said no. She wasn't aware that we had all those kinds. So I came back up and I showed her the catalogue. She found the kind she wanted. She was somewhat reluctant, but she said, \"Ok, you can order this one for me.\" Finally I got my sale from her, and the dream ended there. The dream probably just stems from my desire to get a sale, especially from this woman because I was quite disturbed the second time I came back to her, about a week ago, and I didn't get a sale from her. As I said, this was a short dream. It probably only lasted five minutes. I do remember some color, certainly in the catalogue there was one of the pink brushes, the yellow page. I guess that's about all."

There's a scene of people all gathered around a snowy hill, all in a very happy mood, watching a barrel. A metal barrel about six feet in diameter and 10 ft. long with a bunch of kids in it sliding down a hill. This is quite a great convention and down comes a man roaring down on a barrel stay and goes over a ski jump. He falls flat on his face. Everybody roars down the hill and they are all on barrel stay skis too. It turns out most of them go over the jump and land right on top of him. They pull him up and brush the snow off him.  Everybody as I say is in a real jolly mood. The thing is for skiing on this place, you always had to hike back up the hill. Because this is a little bit hard, it would make things so much easier if they had an automatic way to get up the hill, a ski-lift. The guy that everybody just skied over on top of things, he's going to build one. He's going to have the idea. The next thing he does, he goes over and takes a look at where they have put some logs up to hold a bank back, the idea being that he is going to try to make a ski lift on much the same principle. That is, taking a bunch of logs and building a straight inclined plane right up the slope, and then attaching a rope at the bottom so it can pull up, let's say a cart or something so you can always get up the hill and ski easily. Now it suddenly becomes dinner time, and everybody begins to leave the scene. Myself and another few people are left talking there about this invention when one of the members happens to hit a tree. A turkey, a wild turkey comes out of the brush. Well, he's in real thick underbrush and can't really do much, so we want to get him for dinner. I go around in back and poke at him with a ski pole while the other members of the party get in front of him and grab him. This is an old man and an old woman. They get him and they take him back. The scene shifts to a barn, and in this there's a bird about the size of a partridge or rough grouse. I start going after this one. Finally I corner the thing and grab it. Take that in too. Also in there I find a chicken, after some work and holding onto the rough grouse, I get the chicken too. I manage to come back with both of these and in a pretty jovial mood. I bring these into a big kitchen which is somewhat of a modern kitchen. There the lady of the house has got a small chicken she has just bought in one of the stores, and she likes the thing a lot because of the way it's been dressed. She thinks it is a very good buy. Here the dream ends. I have no idea where the dream came from or any interpretation of it. The characters well all unfamiliar. I was not the principle character. The principle character I would say was the man who was trying to build the ski lift. There were several people in the dream. The woman who was happy about the chicken seemed to have been my mother. I'm not sure about this. This is just the impression I got."

The dream took place on a farm I worked on last summer and the summer before. I think when it started I was driving my car around, that is the present car I own now. I remember parking it in the front yard. It had a lawn there and a stream, but they don't have one in actuality though. There were several other people working there. All of them my age. I can't place any of them right now. They seem to be some of my friends. I seem to know them all anyway. I was working out in the fields most of the day. After working for a few hours, I stopped and was doing something. I could have been working on the car. I'm not sure. At any rate, I wasn't working for the boss. Soon after this, it seemed everybody gathered in the front yard, and everybody was just fooling around, playing games as it were. I remember there was a very large, well like a weather balloon. They were kicking back and forth. I joined in this also. Then I waited on the sidelines with another friend of mine because I knew we shouldn't be doing this. We should be working. The boss came out then. He didn't seem too mad, but he wanted to know how to get everybody back to work. I just suggested that he say no pay unless you get back to work. He said it and everybody got back to work. I was just about to go to work then. I looked at my car and noticed it was all covered with sand. The hood was up. I looked around inside. I was afraid perhaps that somebody dropped sand down the carburetor or filled up the air cleaner with it. There was sand around there, but all the fittings were tight, so no sand could get into it. So I put the hood down and went back to work. Then the scene shifts to a room in the farm house and I was working on a term paper. This term paper was on the development of automobiles. On the European style vs. the American style. I can remember doing a report on these and taking pictures out of a booklet that I had then subjecting it to the farmer to read. For some reason I was passing it to him. Maybe it was just for approval. I'm not sure. At any rate, he liked it and the dream seemed to have ended there. I really can't interpret this too well. He seemed to be consistent or acted just the way he always does. I noticed that his children never appeared in the dream, and they were certainly always around the farm house when I was back there. As for colors I do remember vividly the grass was kind of green, and the big beach ball, weather balloon that we were kicking around was brown. It was very much like a basketball except it was rather large."

I'm a Fuller Brush man again. This time selling very much in the center of a city, apartments. The dream started when my boss picked me up to take me to my area to sell. I remember I parked my car, met him, and he took me a couple of miles through the city. He wants to go down expressways to this area that I was to sell in. In his car he had 2 daughters about 4 or 5 years of age. I can't remember too much of the details of the actual selling. It didn't seem as if it were too successful though. As I say, I was in apartment houses. After it was all over, I met him again and we started back. I remember he was telling me not to be too worried about the way I did because that area was quite hard to sell in any way. Then we started back on some expressway. We reached a very large hill and started down it. I remember he put the brake on to slow ourselves down because he was going about 70 miles an hour going down this hill. Just as he put the brake on, he seemed to almost just collapse. He moved forward and hit his head on the windshield, then just slumped down in the seat. Well, this threw the car out of control. I remember I didn't panic at all. I just merely reached over and grabbed the wheel. I kept us going straight. Then I had to push myself over on the seat and somehow managed to get him out of the way so I could get a hold of the brake pedal. This took a while, but I finally reached it and just as I was beginning to put the brake down to slow us down I woke up. I just might mentioned a few other things. The car we were driving was a '55 Ford. This is not the car that Moss has. He has a Corvair. Also the hill we were going down is certainly no place in Boston or no place else I've ever seen before. This is a monstrous hill. In front of us there were 2 trucks, so if we had gone out of control, it would have been quite bad. The daughters in the front seat, they were also in the front seat with me. There were 4 of us in the front seat, and they were frightened, but not too frightened. I guess that's about all. A few more things I remember about the dream. It was really cold, which was another thing that made me think it was a northern city. Also we were going down this hill, I can remember I was trying to get the car into neutral also. I don't know why, but I sort of tried to do it without the clutch too--just tried to pull the gear shift lever into neutral. It was a standard shift car. As for emotions in the dream, I would say it was fairly neutral even right up to the point where we were going down this hill. I can remember when this first happened. I thought what a terrible situation we were in, but then I controlled myself. I just said, \"Don't panic.\" I just calmly tried to grab the wheel and push my boss out of the way so I could get to the brake pedal."

            "content": "I was with a friend of mine, Jan, who came down here to the lab last night. I brought him down to take a look at it. I was out in my car and I was having trouble. I had to jack up the rear end of the car to change the tires. I guess I had to change two tires, both of them on one side. We also had along my roommate's scout, which is more or less like a jeep. I don't know how it came along or who was driving it. Anyways, it was there. I remember one thing, the car went into a ditch. I guess that was intentional because then we could tip the thing and get at the wheels. I didn't work out too well. I remember the scout was also in the ditch, and it was full of water. When I pulled back the matting on the bottom of the thing, I pulled out some drain plugs to let the water drain out. This is something that is not in the scout right now, and it fills with water every time it rains, and I keep telling my roommate that he should do it, put in these things, but evidently on this trip they were in there. We went to a farm house. And now it was the scout that seemed to be having the troubles and my car disappeared from the scene. I backed up onto an extremely steep ramp and there both rear wheels were exposed and we could do our work on them very easily. The farmer that came out just wondered what we were doing and we told him and he said, \"That's all right, go ahead.\" I guess we finished whatever we had to do. Then I went and talked to the farmer. He was a young man about 25 or 27. He wasn't saying too much. I told him that I had worked on a farm and loved it. This didn't get much of a rise out of him though. Then I told him that I noted that he had Holstein cows. We thought a Holstein cow was the only way to legally water down milk. This made him split a gut, he was really laughing. He really thought this was funny. Just in the way of explanation, Holstein cows have a very low butter fat content in milk. In fact, it's lower than the minimum standard permitted by the state. We left the farm house and in the next scene I was alone in a very large house which was full of lamps and couches and all kinds of things. I guess I was an interior decorator's house. I remember in particular he had two small girls and they were playing near staircases and there was no railing around these and I kept wondering why they didn't fall. It didn't seem to bother him at all. There was a lack of protection for them. They never did fall. There was also something about me doing some work on my car there, and when I was through I remember I came back into the house and handed him back his shirt evidently which I had been wearing. I don't remember  ever taking off mine. I just remember handing him back his. It was a sports shirt, cotton sport shirt. After I came out of the house. I drove off and had to come back. I remembered something. I can't remember what it was, but I ran over and saw his daughter. His daughter was sitting in a group with three other women and speaking German. I have had very little German and I couldn't do much in the way of conversation with her, but she spoke in English and said something. I went back to the house and got something and then left. The way I was going, however, I thought I knew the way back. It was an expressway, more or less. There was about a 45-mile speed limit, but I was doing much faster than this. I was unhappy because my car seemed rather sluggish. In fact, a motor scooter passed me. Well, this motor scooter, which was a Vespa with two guys on it, slowed down and they talked to a, the driver talked to a black and white '57 Chevy. Then the Chevy dropped back to me. In it was the daughter that I had just talked to. She said, \"I thought you knew your way back to the university.\" And I said, \"So did I, but I guess I'm wrong.\" She said, \"Well, continue on straight ahead.\" When I got up there, I saw that I had just made a complete circle because there was a toll booth I had just gone through. When I got up there, she explained what had happened. I pulled a $20 bill out of my wallet and 2 guys in the toll booth both grabbed it and they both handed me back a $10 bill, slapped me on the back and said ok. I said, \"What happened,\" you know, because I got back all the money. He said, \"We're letting you go through free,\" or excuse me, an 8-year-old boy said that to me who was also in the toll booth. I guess one of them in there was his father. So I said, \"Great,\" but before I started out, another car came up and a guy asked me for change. I remember him handing me some, but I also remember him scraping his little finger through my wallet. I know he didn't get any bills, but I remember I thought he pulled out a 25 cent piece or something, but I had change all over the seat from something. I said, \"Oh, the heck with it,\" and drove on. I was on a large expressway and had the car up to 85. I was listening to WFUN, the Rick Farragen show, I guess it was, and he just won some contest and just about this point I woke up. Hall: REM II, good recall, unusual features of the dream, backing cars into ditches and up the ramp at the farmer's house. Time for the dream, present time. A little anxiety in the dream. The blue Vespa for color, black car. An unfamiliar setting. The day residue: Ed brought Jan down to the Institute to look at the place. About 15 minutes to dream."

That's where the subjects sleep. I can remember sleeping there for a few nights and then seeing a list of about 30 names and the things that each one of us being used were to prove or disprove. I was being used to test the theories of one man. Some of the people were being tested on 3 different theories at once. The time was close to the end of the school semester, right next to vacation, summer vacation, and I was fairly interested in seeing if I could get a ride home. I remember going out and looking around. First going into, well, what started out to be a sports car. It turned out to be a walk-in truck. In other words, what I first saw was a sports car, but I went inside and the thing was monstrous. It had the dimensions of a walk-in truck. The inside was rather funny. The driver's compartment was completely screened off, not just screened. It had a wall around it and a small wooden door that you got in and out of. This was on a lower level. This is a two-story car. It had a right hand drive. On the left hand side there were two high-backed chairs side by side. Going upstairs in this thing, there was a set of controls up there more or less like a, the same idea as the controls of a flying bridge on a power boat out here. I remember asking the owners of this vehicle if they were going back up north, meaning somewhere around New York at the end of the year. They said they were and they were interested in a rider and I told them that I had quite a lot of stuff, and they said that would rather throw me out because they couldn't take much. I said alright. I think I'm probably going to use my own car, but in case I don't I would like to line up a ride. Then there's something a little hazy and then I remember having to get something and walking down to a man who is in charge of housing, I guess. He was also in a truck, walk-in truck. All around him were guys sleeping. I guess they were drunks because it more or less looks as if they had just been thrown there in a pile. There were several piles of these guys just sleeping and they were in the weirdest positions. I don't know, it just looked as if they were stiff and had just been piled the way they were in perfectly wonderful, blissful sleep. This guy who was in the truck had something to do with housing, was really having a hard time fighting off going to sleep himself. He did not have what I wanted and so I returned to the house or the dream lab and there I saw, first I was talking with a friend, and then another boy came in, and he said his name was Canon or something like that. So I came over and asked if he knew a friend of mine named Canon, and he said actually his name wasn't Canon. It was Cramer. No, it wasn't that either. It was something close to Cantor, but it wasn't Cantor. He said it was a new name. The sweatshirt he had on was an advertisement for the religion Christian Science. My mother's a Christian Scientist, and she tried to bring me up as one, but it didn't work out that way. He was also working in a dream lab. I was talking to him. He was about to go upstairs for something. As I was talking to him, I showed him this list of subjects we're doing that I mentioned a few minutes ago. Then he showed me what he was doing or told me. He was testing out the theories of some woman, I can't remember who. Just about at this point I woke up."

However, for some reason I thought I was in Florida. I remember just coming down the hill and I had gotten up to 60 miles an hour, and I was just pumping the brakes and slowed myself right down to about 40. I said, \"I'll just put it in second and keep it there.\" So I shift into second and I guess I had a little trouble getting it in because I was looking at the shift anyway. When I looked up there was a parked car right in front of me, and I jammed on my brakes to avoid it and swerved, came around and then I just barely hit another parked car that was ahead of this first one I saw. This second one was about a '54 Plymouth and my right wheel or tire went into his left tire well, that is the front tire well. I didn't see that there was any damage done to the car, but I just put somebody else, a friend of mine, but one that I'm not familiar with, said that I had cracked the fender. I got out and took a look at this car and didn't think so because it had been in a hole and it was all cracks and dents. The first car that I swerved to avoid was a friend of mine. It was a red Valiant, and I remember the paint job got real bad on it. He had his name in magic marker on the window ledge on the driver's side. There was a bunch of phone numbers of girls. About the time I was noticing this, I got woke up by the alarm clock. The color of the car that I hit was sort of a light blue."

            "content": "The earliest thing I can remember was coming on to an old farm which looked as if it had all been closed down. It was located in Vermont, supposedly in the center of the state. The dream for some reason seems to be taking place in the past. I looked around the farm for a while and then went to the edge of a steep bank. There's a file? built near the bank and I looked over the bank and there were 3 large sailboats. Two of them had 3 masts and one of them had 2. They were, one was way over a 100 ft. The smallest was about 50 ft. I was looking at these, I remember, and I noticed a penny just down over this bank. I reached down to get it and it was a 1916 penny in perfect condition, just like it had come right out of the mint, and I thought, \"Oh boy, here's a valuable penny,\" so I picked it up and put it in my pocket. Then as I was standing there, it seemed as if I dropped a camera that I had with me. Excuse me it was an exposure meter, and this broke and as I was picking up the pieces 2 men came around the trail. I saw them long before they saw me, but I realized there was no way I could get away from them without them seeing me, so I just stood there. They were a little surprised and asked me if I had permission to be on the property and I said no, I was just interested in the place, and they didn't seem to be too mad. Then they asked me if I had a key to the barn. I said, \"No, I don't know what you're talking about.\" He said, \"Well, come on in.\" He opened the door and it was just filled with camera equipment. We were, I guess, on the 2nd story. \"Remember,\" I said, \"this barn was built back into the hill, and so in other words you entered about in the center of the barn.\" There was a man taking some pictures in a studio, which was down below us and then it was like one big camera shop for the rest of the place. I was just walking through. I was amazed at all the cameras that were there. They were for the most part Japanese makes. I can't remember much which one now. It was a familiar one to me. I remember I walked over to a bin of used cameras and I noticed an old Polaroid camera, but it was made by Ansco, which doesn't make Polaroid cameras. This really surprised me and I looked over it for a long time. The thing was so rotten, I doubt if it would take pictures. I told him I couldn't afford anything right then, but I was interested in seeing some of his prices. He showed me a catalogue and he picked out one item which I had, which was a telephoto lens and he said he could get it for me for $25. I paid about $32 for it, so it was a pretty good price. Then I decided I would have to leave and as I went out the door, I was bending over looking around the steps for some parts to my exposure meter, which I hadn't picked up, and I found them all and then I went to my car and I went back home. Now there was a lot more to this dream that had to do with what happened back home with the car. I just can't remember it, though. I do remember one other scene in the camera store, though. A boy about 15 came in with a camera that he wanted fixed. It was just a simple box camera, and the guy said he would do it for $2,and the whole bottom was broken out of it. I was rather surprised they cold do it for this price. He did. Then another boy came in and bought a rather expensive 35 mm. camera. For some reason this property, instead of being just a farm, was the estate of a very rich man who had died, and the property was just no longer in use. As I mentioned, the boats were there, and they seemed to belong to him. They had some symbolism or something like that of a manufacturing empire. It seemed to be textiles, though I didn't see a textile mill around. Vermont used to have a lot of textile mills and a lot of them are closed down in many of the towns. I remember wondering where there was a lake big enough to sail about 200 ft. long, as long as the big one probably was. I guess that's about all I can recall."

I found myself, plus a few other people, were going on a trip, but before we went, my mother wanted me to go over and ask my grandfather about the feasibility of our family going to Africa. We were in a 1955 Plymouth. So we went over there and I was appointed to ask him. When I first got in, he was busy talking with a doctor. The doctor, I guess, was just giving him a little examination and also talking about the glories of Africa. It also seems that the doctor was something like a vacuum cleaner salesman, but that's a little foggy, and I can't quite remember it. When the doctor finally got through talking to my grandfather, I asked him about Africa and taking my parents. He said a very emphatic no. He said my mother cold never live there. He said there were too many snakes. He said that you live net to a big zoo because they had caged animals, but he said the only way you could live down there was to shoot and kill the food, and he didn't think my mother would ever get along. I went back to the car. It seems as if my mother had gone on to a camp we were staying at and the car had come back and it had 2 other guys and myself so that there were 3 in all, but we drove a ways and then we came to a large zoo, just like the one my grandfather described in Africa. It almost seems as if we were in Africa. We looked around there for a while, and then there were 3 African people who came up to the car and wondered if we were going back to camp. We said we were, so they asked for a ride. The car started back for camp, and I remember we were all rather tired as it had been a long trip. The guys said to stop at the next bar and get a drink. I was a little worried because I knew my mother wouldn't like it if she smelled it, and also we had one guy that I was sure was under 21. Now for this scene it seemed to be sort of in the United States because there were tobacco fields and the billboards were in English. There was one lipstick billboard and therefore red lips on the girl. Just about this time the alarm went off."

We took off and circled around the rest of the guys that were in this Marine Corps organization, and I remember thinking about how impressed everybody would be that I would be in this beautiful plane, this real fast plane, that it's a real sleek, real good-looking airplane. And then if I remember right, the friend that was flying me to get where we had to go -- I think we were going over to his house, I don't believe it was my house, it might have been -instead of flying through the air, we flew through a tunnel, a real long, long tunnel. It was a well-lit tunnel. I remember going real fast through this tunnel. And on one of our voyages through this tunnel, we either landed purposely or the plane stopped, and one of my professors, the professor I have for oral interpretation, came out of the wall.

As I remember, he was running through the woods like everybody else, and they were shooting guns, rolling around, and while they were doing all this rolling around and shooting, somebody came up, some one of the heroes came up and shot something, shot some kind of a live grenade or something, and he spared his life. No, he actually didn't spare his life; he gave up himself so that everybody else wouldn't get caught in the blast. After the hero got fragments in his legs and arms and everything, and after the war is over, with a buddy of his and him were in the same hospital, and his buddy, the hero's buddy, gets alright, but he's, the hero's buddy is commenting, I remember him commenting to the nurse that he'll never be able to fly again, meaning the hero would never be able to fly again. And for some reason the hero would never really be happy unless he was flying an airplane. And the hero's friend was presuming that the hero would never walk again also, and he went to take a, he was wearing the hero's boots literally, and the nurse came in and told the hero's friend that the hero would be able to walk again and that he'd have to give his boots back. The hero's friend in turn walks in there so that he just wouldn't believe this, and I remember him, the hero's friend, walking in with a white tee-shirt with a Hiccock gummed label on it like it was still in the store, and when he got very mad, he just took this gummed label which was blue and white from the shirt and threw it down. In some way this was his minor way of protesting that the hero was getting better and that the guy would have to give him back his boots.  There was a series of little alleyways made of barbed wire, and our men, the American men, were during the fighting running back and forth through these little alleyways, and it was almost as though they were doing it to be intentionally shot, because everyone that tried it got shot. And these kept running up and down these things, and there was enemy machine guns all around the place.  The enemy was German."

The whole base of the dream was my coming from one point to home. The dream seemed to be more in the tense of the past. It just didn't have the characteristics of a present. My father particularly. In the past, well, it just seemed different. The house seemed to be across from our house where we lived in New Jersey. Very good friends of my mother and father lived there, and this seemed to be the house we were occupying. This dream seems to be fouled up by the same sort of feeling and situation of the first dream recorded tonight of a light plane landing, myself sitting, watching it. It seemed to be completely different from the dream about my folks. There seemed to be no relationship between the two. It was just as if one was cut off, and the next thing this one starts, but the bit with the plane wasn't as if a story or something. It was just this plane was landing and that was all there was to it. This was to be the end anyway. The __________ referred to was known to me before reaching home and this was going thru my mind as I was traveling to my destination, and there was hardly any conversation between myself and my folks, just a salutation upon arrival and exchange of words. This was the extent of the dream."

However, after awakening and trying to recall the dream, sort of gathering all the thoughts together, the thought of possibly, instead of learning to fly that I was, let me see, was playing golf, but it's hard to explain the situation, playing a green, in the sense that everything the area of the dream was confined to a limited space, such as marked off by the green on the hole where you have rough grass and then there's a perimeter and there's a small area of well kept grass. This is the feeling or the sense I got, that there was a surrounding of something. However, it didn't seem to be as small and confined as the circle of the green. More as you look at the picture, wide at the top and only one side was evident, and it would come around like a bump and then to the bottom. It seemed that there was someone else, not so much being seen physically as just I was, he was the point of my attention, sort of like the conversation, the person I was having the conversation with. It's sort of scrambled and difficult to distinguish whether it was flying which was my first impulse or it might have been golf. I'm inclined to think it's more the latter for the simple reason it's the latest of the two I have engaged in."

She seemed to be in a hurry as if it needed to be done within a matter of a short period, so I started it and then she came back and said, \"Is this the way it's finished?\" Something like this. I answered, \"Yes.\" She says, \"Well, I hope it better hold,\" meaning the last knot and I said, \"Oh, it will.\" Then she hurriedly moved off. There was no action really in between starting this handicraft and when she came back and had it finished. The woman was the mother of this girl whom I know from camp and is a freshman at the University of Florida. I was talking to her this evening on the phone so my contact with her has been within the immediate future."

The executive was old, not old but 60's, baldheaded, heavy a little bit, not heavy, just a little. Just a typical-looking executive boss. By controls I was referring to it's almost like sitting up in the control tower watching the airplane land down on the field. However, I didn't see a setting that would represent a control tower. It was just the position I was in and the anxiety that I seemed to have as the airplane came in. These anxieties weren't anything different than a normal person watching a plane come in.

The setting was not stable in the sense that there seemed to be a movement from ___________ something that made comments and was just natural to just something altogether out of place. The trouble with the bugs was very (spawn?) real lonely. More than a fear of a number of different bugs, the dream was centered around a particular individual bug or insect, something to this effect. It was just a matter of a couple different people reacting to the fear of this insect. The identity of the insect was not known."

There was a fence there and the word came, \"Pull the weeds.\" Walked around the fence, and the guy was still at the table waiting for him to write the (bowl?), and I was saying to myself, \"I hope he wins and then I'll beat him bad,\" or something like this. I was really emotionally angry. [Were you angry at the guy?] Yeah, quite mad because I said to him, \"You know I got orders,\" and he said, \"No, you don't.\" I do. I says, \"You know how long I've been waiting.\" He says, \"Yeah, but do you know how long you played?\" I said, \"I've been waiting here since 7 o'clock, whatever it is, which is about an hour and a half.\" So it went on like this. That's when I woke up. I got half way around the fence pulling weeds. Most likely I went outside to pull weeds to expel my temper or just get rid of it on something other than hauling off and slugging the guy. This had happened that day in the sense that this is probably just a retake of what happened to me this evening, but it wasn't quite as bad. There were three others in the dream, two fellows that were playing and then at another table there was, I believe, only one fellow. There was no distinct scene or recognition. It was as if I was over at Eaton Hall where they have the pool tables. I was standing looking right at them, arguing with him. It was this one fellow and when I went outside, I looked back at them pulling weeds. It was someone else. It wasn't the same person as far as face, but I referred to him as being the same person, so it was just somehow or another the face of the person changed. I do recognize the faces as far as being some fellows who shoot at the union, but it wasn't the face of the fellow I had actually got in a small argument with tonight."

I had a little cap. I was laying on the side of the pool, and I'm supposed to be trying to help him up, but it looked more like they were helping me and it was supposedly a series of four, four shots in succession of me as a younger kid. However, they eventually turned out to be moving pictures. There was another group of pictures of a girl doing the same thing I was doing.  It was sort of like an, not an advertisement, but an example of how other people can use this type of rescue. There was no purpose of the rescue. It wasn't being used by the Red Cross or a standardized job; there was no real point to it. As I was viewing this, I was looking at myself and was just noting muscle structure of my body, trying to get a picture of what I supposedly look like to others when younger. However, at this closer look, I seemed to all of a sudden just become my usual size again. The first original snapshot appeared to be myself very young with a hat, baseball hat, just to give a significance of youth. Then the movie of the pictures I seem to enlarge. This dream is what just appeared to be the tail end of another dream. However, my recall for the other, longer dream is not very good at all. In fact, I remember, that's just not clear right now."

For a change I replied something to the effect that, yeah, I guess. Money doesn't mean much or something.

The time that this took place is hard to say, but we were drinking beer and it was as if I was back in high school when we used to have to worry about being caught by policemen for drinking beer because we were under age. Well, now I didn't feel this way. I mean, I was thinking to myself, \"Well, I don't have anything to worry about because I'm of age, whereas these fellows didn't,\" so we all sort of had the feeling of having to worry because there was a policeman on a motorcycle, sort of, well, just across the way and he was occupied with something else. We were afraid of him seeing us. I can remember pouring a beer into a glass, drinking it fast and pouring the rest from the can into the glass. I think this might have been a recurrence of what I had done prior to coming here. I was at the airport and I had a beer in a bar, and I poured beer from a can into a glass. This possibly might be sort of just a repeat of this. There might be an association there. However, this was the extent of the dream except, as I said earlier, the characters seemed to be changing from one guy and the next thing you knew he was somebody else, still somebody I knew, but a different person from the first one. We had, I believe, just one six-pack. We were all drinking it and trying to keep the officer from, you know, noticing us. The officer never did come over and say anything to us."

Most of the time I was sitting on a bed looking at a magazine and carrying on whatever conversation I was having. I knew that I was on the bed because I happened to look into a mirror and actually saw my own face. I knew it was Jackie Kennedy, well, because she was in the same room. However, there were no sexual connotations. We were both fully dressed. It seemed as if she was changing moods with the narration. Mr. Kennedy wasn't really the center of the dream. He was, he just happened to be the guy I was talking about. But I didn't see any guy. It was just me and her. It was not a well-organized thought pattern. What I mean is things didn't happen real logically. One minute it seemed like the interest was in or about Mr. Kennedy, and the next time it was about, well, Jackie and myself. The impression most left was that of referring to Kennedy as a young child, not a young child, but near his youth, more so than after he became president. What was weird about the setting was that it wasn't logical in the sense the bedroom, we weren't on the same bed, or I was on one large double bed and sort of as if on stage, you know, as you look at a stage towards the back of the stage, directly, back, well, it was like she was down on that bed so there didn't seem to be any sexual implication.

His daughter was young, maybe 11 or 12 years old, possibly a year younger or older. I can't recall. Anyway, it seems that I offered to give her a ride home from wherever we were. I can't recall right now. The man was standing in front of me talking and I was noticing how he was dressed. The full picture of the dream is becoming not distorted, but just less clear, harder to define. I do recall though that through the weirdness of dreams, one minute I was offering this girl a ride home, and the next thing I was like a student, just a student being lectured by this fellow, and the girl was sitting next to me. It seemed we were at some meeting or something. I can't really say what. I was to give her a ride home after the meeting or whatever it was we were there for. Then I recall being obligated to stay at this person's house for the night. This is where my recall is not very clear, and it is really difficult to say why or what I did or exactly what happened. This dream was recalled after Max had left. I was no able to recall this dream while Max was in the room for some reason or another. Upon being awoken, there seems to be like a small mental block developed so that recall is much more difficult even when just closing the eyes and trying to, or just waiting for the dream to possibly reenter the conscious state, but as soon as Max left, and I was attempting to return to sleep, the dream which I had prior to wakening became clear again, not to the extent that I could recall the full dream, enough of it to know that this was what I was dreaming before awakening. The dream did no seem really plausible. One minute seemed to be in the past, and the next minute right at the present. It was vivid, just average, or maybe a little bit better. Recall is being like I might have stated earlier, well, but it didn't recall the full meaning or just even the full dream, just the main portion of it. I do think I saw some color or I attempted earlier to mention I was noticing he way he was dressing. Now I can't. It's distorted, as I say, exactly the way he was dressing, but it did seem as if it might have been in color or else I was just thinking of it as certain colors to my own taste, so to speak. The dream did not seem to take long, maybe just a few minutes or even shorter. As I said, it didn't seem completely plausible. This dream did not seem to be a take off of any experience that I have had in the last day or two. It seemed to be just as if I was meeting an acquaintance from the past and this happened in the past or even right now at the present. This is definitely the dream that I was having on being awoken for the second time this morning. I was just not able to recall it when being awoken, but as I was getting ready to go to sleep, it returned to my consciousness, my awareness of having dreamt the dream , and I was able to recall a portion of that dream."

And then the next thing I knew, I was sitting in what I believe was the library and I was waiting for someone to apparently arrive for some reason or another. It wasn't real clear.

Prior to awakening, I had just plotted out an axis with the angles too acutely drawn. The drawings were graphs and merely consisted of intersections. I had just finished drawing an intersection for another member of the class, and I made the angles too small. They were supposed to be 90 degree and they were probably about 30. It was a man I had plotted the angle for and I believe most of the members of the class were men, including the instructor. I hadn't recognized the instructor or anyone in the dream. It didn't have a class setting in the sense it was spread out in rows of chairs. The dream was confined to a small layout sort of going from a large foreground to a small background so that you would be going straight back instead of outward. It was as if it was just one row of just a few, small people working on these assignments, whatever they were. The setting was like a combination of the experimental psych class and the drama class, the drama class in the sense that the assignments were due certain days by each individual, such as one person was expected Thursday or Friday or some day, and the work that we were doing was much like a lab class in that like plotting out graphs, something like this. The graph was something like stamping two lines at an angle over a sort of curved surface. At first, not thinking it mattered that the lines intersected 90 degrees, just stamped them and when it was inspected by the student who it was for and the instructor, they noticed that the angles did not intersect at 90 degrees. However, they mentioned it would still be able to be used."

Then about Virginia just before I went to bed, I was reading in letters to the editor in the Saturday Review, about this article about the conservative viewpoint on civil rights. In this letter there was a reference to Virginia. The author of the article had referred to James Madison as one of the founding fathers that we didn't pay sufficient attention to anymore, and in the letter it was pointed out to him that Marshall the Chief Justice was also a Virginian and it was he who had started the tradition of changing the constitution by interpretation rather than by amendment. I was also thinking about that girl's honor thesis, Stephanie N____ that I've read, but that I haven't sent comments on yet, and in this thesis there is a reference to Virginia Axline.

This whole thing reminds me of junior high school days in the seventh grade when Frank _____ and John Tihanic and I were just making fast friends of each other, and John Tihanic was kind of the, everybody's favorite.

It's like this other coach, maybe he knows his business a lot better than I do, and I'm just putting on a front. But in the game now wher I'm back younger, I'm also feeling very confident. One play is particularly vivid. This player on my team comes dribbling down the court and he's completely bottled up. I know he's looking around for me so he can pass me the ball, but he can't see me. I can see that I could come up from behind and just take the ball out of his hands and score an easy basket. So I shout to him that's, well, I just to him my name I think and try to take the ball and go in for a lay-up, but he doesn't let me have it as I go by. I think at that moment, \"Gee, that's a nifty play.\" He didn't know it was me, but we'll have to work on that one, and in two or three times that will be a real score maker. Then I can see another play. I remember somebody on my team is on the other end of the court and he is tied up. I start up and I'm way down at the opposite end, clear, and he's about to throw a full court pass."

I think I was just out to a store to pick up some kind of Hungarian, oh, I don't know, bread or tobacco. The word comes to mind, Stetson or Steveson. Anyhow I come home and I'm all in fine spirits, and Audrey's got this. Now wait a minute. There's another part. Well, she's got the beds changed around in the apartment. That didn't seem to bother me so much. She's fixed up the back part into two small cubicle-like arrangements, and has two small beds back there. One looks like an ironing board. I don't quite know what we were fighting about, but I remember the feeling well. It's like we were arguing about some minor thing. I guess something occurred that I don't like that I want her to stop or to change or something, and she keeps adding one more word like going too far. It was like the fight could be settled at any moment, but she has to add one tiny remark that gets it started again. When I was awakened, I think I was just about to blow my top, lose my temper over some, one of these last straw things where she's just said I won't or something. Prior to that, the part I forgot, we were driving a couple of cars. Oh yes, Maury Schwartz is following us and another car, and I blow the horn at him to follow me because I know a shortcut that leads through a lot of backyards. You know, this is in New Brunswick up the street. Like the shortcut I used to take walking to school. Anyway, he falls in behind, and every once in a while I think I've lost him or that he's lost me. I look in the mirror and stop for awhile, and then I see him catching up. He's still there though. There's something about Carol Kay in a car. Now I'm beginning to sense what the connection is between those two. Yes, some kind of comparison. Maury knows how to follow and Audrey's just being a pain in the ass and losing sight of what matters. There's another part. At one point I must have gone through a stop street or a red light or something, but Maury is getting the ticket, and I look in the mirror and there he is stopped by the cop. I don't know whether to stop and go back or whether to keep on going. At any rate it looks like I go off Scott free on that one cause I'm also breaking limits. I can't quite remember that first part that had to do with the store and the Hungarian neighborhood and the food. I guess it had to do something with a bar like up at the St. Emory's club, and I think maybe I can get it by associating. I think of hard boiled eggs. Oh yea, Co____ had hard boiled eggs last night, the pickled ones that you have in a bar. I think of potato pancakes at Jimmy ____________ grandmother used to make. I can't get the name, Stetson.

This woman is dressed in as a knee, like knickers and very fancy clothes and is pointing out various things to this group. I'm off on the side and Audrey is there. It turns out that this is really my speech, but that she's giving it. It turns out that this is the custom in these times. Nobody gives their own speech. They always have some kind of a stand-in. It's like a pen name except with regard to lecturing. It turns out she's talking about my scoring system. Audrey is there with me, and I'm pointing out to her some of the nuances of this scoring system that the old battleaxe is talking about. Somebody else is there like maybe my father-in-law, Max. He's getting a big bang out of this and Audrey is pointing out an inconsistency. One of the categories doesn't seem to quite fit. Then I say it does and she says something like, \"Well, what if you had a dream item like this, it wouldn't fit.\" I suddenly realized that she's right on that one, but then I have this woman pronounce a new principle, like we'll deal with that kind, something like we won't. It's the opposite of burning bridges after you cross them. You don't look for trouble until you find it or something like that. The scene switches in here and I'm in a bar and something about some women. That's all I get of that."

I'm at a large resort, a hotel, very, very elaborate, very lush, plush, something like the Fontainebleau only more tasteful. I had just been swimming, like sort of fountains and also like a pool, except this wanders around the whole hotel with bridges that cross it. At this moment in the dream, it's at night and it's kind of cold and cloudy. I'm walking across one of these bridges and I'm saying to myself I had just been swimming there. I'm thinking of going back in again. Somewhere in this hotel either before or after this, I was observing something. There was this guy who was going around, this radio announcer was going around saying that maybe it was a baseball player, anyway he was some kind of performer and he was going around saying that Kurt Goudy was crazy, a paranoid. Kurt Goudy is the Boston Red Sox radio announcer. He keeps saying that every tiny little thing that goes wrong makes this Kurt Goudy blow his top. Then what do you suppose is happening? This guy who's saying this, who's claiming that Kurt Goudy is always losing his temper over nothing, is seen loosening his skate. He's off somewhere arranging for Kurt Goudy's skates to come loose, roller skates. I think that the word shoe shine brought this all back to me. At any rate I see this going on and I think to myself, \"Well why? I wonder who's crazy. That's going pretty far to prove a point.\" This performer was some kind of a famous one. He's a very well known, he's a big shot, and it's one thing for him to say Kurt Goudy is crazy. It's another thing for him to stoop to such a petty detail to loosen his skate to prove it. I should say something more about he swimming part. The idea about the swimming was that here was this very, very beautiful setup for swimming and nobody used it. Few people used it, and I was taking great delight in being one of the only ones. Not only was it good swimming, but it also made me feel like I wasn't one of these Miami Beach types."

I can't seem to catch what the problem was, but there is a feeling of going back and forth on some issues, some kind of a debate, like an inner debate. The nearest I can come to it, it reminds me of Ted Fitkin and I arguing as we sometimes do about people getting paid for consulting work. His position is that people get paid by their university and they ought to be happy to do something that they like to do, and my position is that if you don't get paid, eventually you have to settle for the worst people."

It's more like a Volkswagen bus. I picture one of those with a little Volkswagen or Renault inside of it. The idea here is to save time. This way when you come home from work, you can just hop right in the other car, roll it down and out the back, dash off, and then drive the car back up into the Volkswagen bus when you come back.

            "content": "We had a new apartment. It's an open sort of garden apartment, and right next door to a brick office building like the Judge Baker and Children Association in Boston. I'm standing at the window looking across into an office, and there's Evans _________, and I remark to myself that he must have two jobs. He catches my eye as I'm looking over at him, waves and then comes over to the apartment with a group of people, and we have a big party up on the roof. Audrey comes home. Then there are just the two of us there together, and there's something about my mixing a drink. Then the doorbell rings. She goes downstairs, comes back and says that there's somebody selling the Saturday Evening Post, and I should go down and tell him that we don't want any. I say why the hell don't you tell him, and she says she's too embarrassed. I had the image of the salesman being a young boy, but as I was going downstairs, I saw thru the bottom of the door, and it was the front porch of the house that I grew up in on Summerset Street in New Brunswick. I saw under the door this foot and it was a club foot which explained why Audrey was too embarrassed. She probably would have wanted to buy the magazine out of sympathy, but then she would have had a hard time explaining to me why she got the Saturday Evening Post. Anyway I opened the door and feeling a little sheepish myself, I said that we didn't want the Saturday Evening Post and closed the door. The scene shifts and I'm in a large city that's old Boston which is being changed into New Boston. The most distinctive part is a very old and elaborately decorated, with lots of facades, church. It reminds me of the church alongside of the harbor in Lisbon as you come in, and Calvin and I were talking about Portugal last night and how death-like it is. There was a similar quality about this old Boston. It seems like it was late at night and there were no people around. There wouldn't have been many people around even if it was daytime because the whole place was in a state of disarray. I was in a taxicab, and he driver was pointing out all the different buildings that were going to be torn down and rebuilt. Then all of a sudden he started up this unbelievably steep bridge, so steep that as I was sitting there in the car in the back seat, I could feel kinesthetically that if a little breeze came along, the car might tip over backwards. It was going up almost perpendicularly. I was frightened, but didn't say anything, figuring the taxi driver knew what he was doing. He probably took this route many times. Still I wondered how he stood it. Then I remembered having taken the same bridge myself when I was driving back from Cape Cod one time. It was late and I was in a hurry to get home, and so I overcame my fear of the bridge that time and went over it, but I was so frightened that I wouldn't do it again because the saving of time wasn't worth the fright that I had to go through. This reminds me incidentally of the same kind of experience down in Yucatan and ___________. I was going to climb the __________ stairs and got up 10 or 15 steps and decided that while I wouldn't have any trouble getting up, when it came to coming down I would probably feel very frightened and decided it wasn't worth going thru all that. Then somehow or another I'm not in the cab any longer, but I'm walking on this bridge. It's dark out and I have to watch very carefully where I walk. There seems to be holes around. It's a rather rickety old bridge, part of Old Boston. There's a vague feeling that there are other people around and possibly getting ready to put on a stage production of some kind. They are rehearsing. I think there are posters, the kind you see along the New Haven railroad through Connecticut advertising the Broadway plays. Then the scene shifts again, and I'm in a kind of hospital or university setting. The point is that I am studying for a second degree, another Ph.D. This one in physiology. I'm thinking whether this means that I will have an MD or whether it will be a Ph.D. in physiology, and I decide that it will be the latter. There's something about a girl in this. A large-boned blond like the blond in the picture From Russia with Love. Very good-looking girl, and I think she's nude and somehow or another I'm focused mainly on her abdomen and belly button. There's something about a diamond shape. Diamond shape like a large square of light that's flashed on her abdomen. No particular erotic feelings, although I don't quite understand why not. Then I see the same girl and she has clothes on. She's sitting at a table as though in a cafeteria talking to this other guy, a clerk or something, who works in the hospital or university and she's very openly and candidly telling him about her latest boyfriend and different difficulties that she's having with him. I'm feeling quite envious or inadequate that she's so easy going with this guy and not with me. As I woke up, I was thinking about the impression that these two degrees would make on people. On the one hand, having two Ph.D.'s doesn't show because you only put it down once. On the other hand, it would be very impressive to the few people who would find out about it, that I got a second Ph.D. in physiology, and passed up an MD because the training for both is so close together, this would look like a very scholarly move. There was kind of a conflict going on. On the one hand, getting the Ph.D. in physiology would have been genuine on my part as would passing up the MD, but I seem to be looking around for some little grain of, some little bone to throw to narcissism in there trying to get credit for something."

I remember looking up at Audrey sitting there looking out at me, and we're talking about either who's coming to the dinner or who is already there and it seems like she's invited one other couple and a president like of some place, a school that she works at only he's not coming now because it's raining or he's sleepy, and there's a very minor tiff there with me saying, \"Well now if he's going to do that, then I think I'll do the same.\" I lost the rest of that. In the next scene I'm at the corner of Nassau St. and Livingston Ave. in New Brunswick except it's not New Brunswick, it's Wellesley in the dream. No, it's Route 9 between Wellesley and Boston. It's like I'm back working at Dana Hall School. It's raining out and it's early in the morning. I'm kind of enjoying being outside. I think I'm early for work or early for something, and I decide to just walk around and enjoy the morning. Then I look down and I have a clipboard and some books and papers and pencil and what looks like some telegram envelopes and a cap, like a postman's cap. I think to myself that people will think that I'm a telegram boy, delivery boy, and I'm not. I'm a teacher at Dana Hall School. Then I think to myself, \"But it's a nice morning out, and I'll let the people think what they will.\" Then I'm walking toward a coffee shop and I think I'm going to buy some. I'm looking around as if I was back for a visit. I haven't been around here for a long time, and I'm looking around. I see this store with envelopes and paper and I think I'll stop down there to see if there is anything I might like to buy. Then as I'm crossing the street, this is the clear part, I drop my hat I think and I slip and fall and there's this car coming straight at me. It wasn't coming very fast, though, and I know it will stop or at least it can stop. I sort of catch the eye of the man who is driving this car, a great big guy, an old man, and I look him right square in the eye as I'm lying down there as if to say you can wait, god damn it. I'm not going to hurry. Finally I get up and brush myself off and walk on. As I get a few further steps down the street, I hear this funny noise like a tire that's hit the side of the curb and here's this guy who's passing another car. His car is so big that it bounced off a curb and it almost ran into the back of this junk wagon being pulled by a horse. I think to myself something like, \"Well, that bastard's really in a hurry. Why doesn't he relax?\"  The car that the old man was driving was a big square car like my grandfather's 126 Buick."

Now the scene shifts and I'm in a clinical-looking place like a hospital, but it is a dream lab, but I don't know what to describe what it looks like. It has a hospital atmosphere, but it's a large apartment building. It reminds me of the hospital Martin Orne's mother and father run in Boston on Commonwealth Ave. Some guy with blond hair keeps hopping up and down putting on this white _ length coat and admitting new subjects. I'm one of the veterans here because I've only got one night to go. One new subject is just being admitted and this fellow points out to him his bed and gives him a bill. It's more like a hotel too, gives him a bill and the bill says something like $11 per night and the new subject wants to know if he should pay immediately. Then the blond fellow gives him a little check, like a hat check tag, and that will cost him 50 cents. Then he notes that his bed is all made up and has a reservation card on it. Then the scene shifts again somewhat. It's kind of a beach, promenade place, lots of people walking up and down. The ones that catch my eye, however, are very intense, very good-looking older men. They remind me of photographs I've seen of my father. I'm thinking to myself from the way these men look they're obviously homosexuals on the make, and I seem to have wondered into a choice spot for them to meet. Then it's like I'm back in the dream lab, and I'm thinking to myself of course what else could you think because all you find in a sleep lab, a dream lab, are a bunch of men who are sleeping together as though I'm saying to myself: \"How dense can you get that you didn't see this before?\" The scene shifts again, and I'm like in a mental hospital. It reminds me a little bit of Boston Psycho and the VA hospital in Bedford, and I'm walking down a hall and have to go through many doors as you do in Bedford, locking in, locking each one along the way. At one of them I sort of jostle a very good-looking girl who's with another girl. They're both patients in this hospital. I can't just hurry on because I have to lock and unlock all the doors as I go and I can see that this is just enough time for this girl to make whatever kind of a fuss she's going to make. She looks at me and thinks I'm very good-looking and starts to come after me and I'm locking and unlocking doors along the way. It doesn't work out that way so much. I stop and I say, \"I apologize.\" That's what it is. She says, \"What did you say?\" I say again, \"I apologize.\" This was too much because apparently she was somewhat taken by me anyway, just from looking and now I actually talked to her. I was courteous and now she's really got a thing on me and starts following me down the hall. The scene shifts again and I'm walking along a street that, a famous street of bookstores. They seem to be bookstores that have become so famous and so good they've turned themselves into libraries. As a matter of fact, one has the feeling that the New York Public Library and Widener Library are around this neighborhood, and I run into Harry Rand and Ginia Hoffman. I think Ginia and I must be going in the same direction because I'm going back to work at Brandeis, but as we walk along, it develops that there are some new buildings built there and now we work in different office buildings. I remember we were very happy and warm toward each other. As I turned to leave Ginia, sort of forgetting herself for a moment, and more or less by reflex, puckers up her lips more or less as to kiss me goodbye.  It's an interesting reversal actually. There's been a number of times when I meet Ginia after quite a while that I start to put my arm around her and then I catch myself, partially because I remember that she's not like in my family, but also because it's clear she wouldn't go for this. Yet with women that she works with, she's just the opposite."

It's more like an APA meeting, but this is a small room and there are very few people. It looks like Dr. Taylor's office. I was dreaming that I had already been awakened and was reporting a dream as part of this presentation. I do believe that I had lost some of it as a result. I can pick up, however, where I was when I was really wakened. I had just made several points and I was making a third one that somehow was obviously related to the other two, and it was Calvin had offered me the use of his Volkswagen bus whenever he wasn't using it, and somehow this included the use of the radio which had been installed in a very unusual place in the top of the door. Yeah. Now the point of all this was that somehow or another as a result of taking him up on this offer, I had heard a report. No, that's not it. I just seem to have lost that. Somehow this was a research finding, but I don't remember what I was supposed to be illustrating with this point. There was something about a college president in here and it was a president of one of the women's colleges like Vassar or Smith and her name was Gull. Now that might be the name of somebody on the, that might be one of the subjects, one of Bob's women subjects. There was a girl in my class at Dana hall whose name was Gull Bull, Jane Bull. There was an association. Now in part of the dream also I'm waiting, no I'm in a large building like a large theater or hotel, and I notice this girl being met by her parents, and it's a girl from Brandeis, and she's sort of bubbling over with her mother telling her the latest and they're planning to go out to dinner and movie, I guess. She's kind of a cute little thing, but I think to myself, awfully young. Now back to this presentation, which seems to be the center of the dream. The only other item that I can remember is one of noticing that I had to, in order to make this 3rd point, I had already made two, in order to make this 3rd point, I had to interrupt something that Calvin was just about to say, and I could see that he was a little annoyed at this, but then I thought, \"Well, but he won't be annoyed as soon as he hears the point, especially because it refers to his Volkswagen,\" and this turns out to be the case. I knew that everybody would be especially interested in and amused by the name of the woman's college president being Bull, because as I was giving the talk, I was thinking of an image of a bull and somehow or other, everyone would share this image that was listening to the talk. The image was of a bull with an erection, a big, red, long penis."

I can see these guys flying around and it's like they have bicycles, but some way of balancing them so that they can come down and maneuver various ways with their arms. I don't see the bicycle though. One of them, he's sort of gliding around and then he very, very softly lands in a net that he apparently has laid out between some telephone wires. It seems like Audrey and I are visiting this place and it's temporary. She's got some kind of a new, not a contour sheet, but a contour bedspread, and I'm helping her put this thing on, and she's saying, \"Watch you don't break it or stretch it too much.\" This all seems to be one place and then I'm out in this town again, sort of like a farmyard, or a farm town. It's strange because it's so modern. It has all these flying things and yet the john is an outdoor john. The bathroom is outside, and I want to go to the bathroom, so I go and open the door and the first thing my eyes focus on two urinals off in the corner, dirty as hell, and there are bugs, what look like bugs crawling all around in front of them and I say to myself, \"The hell with this.\" This all takes place in a split second. Before I can even turn around, a bat comes flying out and brushes my head as he goes by. I think that's when I woke up. I said I don't think I want to sleep anymore. It's like it was in the recent past in California, but Audrey was with me, but she wasn't there, and also the feeling is the feeling that I have here. That it's very temporary now, and I won't be here too long. It's part of the dream. Audrey was going to paint the walls some color, and I thought that was a good idea, but now it seemed like half the stay was already gone and she hadn't done it yet, so I figured, \"Well, no sense doing it.\" The hotel room was like the one in Paris. The reason all these folk singers were gathered in this one town it turned out was that was a place where someone had discovered like a whole stock of folk songs. It's like it was the Comstock Lode of folk singing. It was really like there was a mine somewhere. There was a sign pointing to it. It wasn't a mine. It was a place where a lot of folk songs had been written. There's almost something magical about it, like all these kids were here on a pilgrimage."

I'm staying at some place separate from where Audrey is, and I stop by at her place to see how she's doing. I walk in and she's sort of bundled up on the floor in the living room, and now it gets pretty odd. There are 2 cats in this place. Audrey has some special relationship to them and in some parts of this now it seems that she is a cat also. At any rate these two other cats have been in a real fight. Audrey doesn't look in such good place herself, but one of these cats has a very bad eye. Something about it having been the most beautiful cat of all once, but now it looks like it will be lucky if it lives. These 2 cats are so angry at each other that every time they get near they start in again fighting. Audrey, I guess, is trying to be some kind of a peacemaker. At one point she holds them up and somehow immobilizes, no, she holds them up and puts their faces together, and one of these cats has a lot of affection for Audrey and wouldn't scratch when she's around. So Audrey puts these 2 cats together and assumes that since she's around they won't fight each other, but you can see that they are mightily tempted to, and she puts their faces together and you see their claws coming out and they want to take a swipe at each other, but they don't. The most vivid part of the dream is the eye itself of this cat which looked like it's all inflamed and has a big white spot. Now there are other parts of the dream, something about a waterfront and one of these buoys that people swim off of. Then there's been some kind of a crime and the policemen drive out to this buoy. Then the image of somebody's head on a board and someone else who is trying to make him talk or trying to frighten him. Throws a knife, it's like a gold letter opener, and pins the board a fraction of an inch from his head. Somewhere in the dream there are some sexy-looking women around, and also a scene in which I'm traveling on some kind of a vehicle, I suppose a train, and am being hindered in what I want to do or the way I want to feel by having to pay attention to children. I'm either having to take care of them or keep peace between them. I think it's keeping peace between them. I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, in the context of the dream it's clearly my responsibility and I'm also doing it well apparently. On the other hand, it prevents me from doing some other thing that I might want to do. That's probably where the sexy-looking women come in. I don't remember the details."

Then I'm working on an open table on Eastern Avenue in New Brunswick. People are coming and going. There's very loud music coming out of this one house and I assume that it's a place that I own. Then I got to this spot where I sense that the house is that I own, and there's just an empty space there. I'm very puzzled for a moment. Then I locate the music again and it's coming out of another house, and the other house belongs to somebody else, so I can't do anything about it. I see a couple of women walking around in there and they seem to be having a party. I get back at the table and start work again. Then David comes along in his little red car. I don't remember David's last name, but it's the David that lives up at Ijourie's place. He's parked and he's outside looking very closely at the paint job on his car. As I pass him on the way back to the table, I say, \"Hi there, David O,\" and he doesn't say anything. I figure, well, he hasn't heard me, but I just let it go at that thinking I'll get back to work. Then it turns out that David and this friend of his are out to give a prize to somebody for some art work, and I say half jokingly and half seriously that any time he wants to look over my work, he can, with the idea that he might give it the prize. He says no, they're not doing that right now. They really came here to have a picnic, and he opens this bottle of pickles and starts spreading meat out, soda pop and bread all over this table. So I go back to the apartment and now it seems it's getting renovated and there are lots of repairmen around. There's another section to this dream. A female Ph.D. is like an usher and is saying to me as I come into this building, \"Don't forget your Ph.D. card.\" I guess I had lunch and then there's some business about the check and how much of a tip to leave this waitress. I give her $4 and she gives me back 1 peso and 50 centavos. I'm thinking in terms of 50 centavos will be enough of a tip. Then this woman pulls her dress down and she's naked, standing there naked. Then I recognize that it's Shirley MacLaine. She has a strand of red hair sort of greased and twisted around one of her breasts."

I'm in a room with him and there are other people around that somehow or another require attention, not require, but they have to attend to, that doesn't quite get around what I'm trying to say. There's a lot of confusion going on and here old Ed is trying to say something. He's trying to make something clear. He's just trying to express himself. I'm not listening to him as well as I might. The poor guy sort of complains something like, \"You'd think that when a guy has only a few minutes or a few days to live he could get a person's ear.\" Then he says a few things, and I don't know if he expressed what he wanted to. I don't remember what he said. Then in the dream it's as if time passes and I'm going on about my business doing other things, and every once in a while I wonder if Ed has died yet and feel kind of guilty that I didn't find some way of really listening to him. Next I'm in Paulette Cooper's car, and I think my mother is there. This is associated somehow with death also. Paulette is also going to die or she's been dead and came back from the dead or something like that. She's a good dream figure for that idea. She's a girl that was born in Auschwitz. I seem to be ignoring her also. I turn off the motor of the car and then I just take the key and reach out with it and cross the seat where my mother is sitting over to where Paulette is sitting and hand her the keys. I think I dropped them. Then Paulette says something like, \"You're going to be using it again, so why don't you keep the keys,\" and is, I know, trying to get my attention to say something private to me so that my mother won't see or hear. I'm not looking at her, knowing she has to get my eye to get across what she wants to get across. Again I'm feeling kind of guilty about this. That's the end of that dream.

The feeling is that he knows exactly what he's doing and this makes me feel very good. I notice as the car is going up on the lift that there are big chunks of mud stuck to the cracks in the tire tread. Next Stanley Cantor is standing naked in a room and is having some very routine service performed for him, like have a button sewed, his fingernails cut or something like that. A very young girl is taking care of him. There he is standing with his penis hanging out. I'm thinking to myself how can he be so sure that this isn't going to get her all excited, especially because she's such a young girl. Maybe she's never even seen one before."

So I was thinking, gee, what a fool that he wants to buy that dinky ring. In fact, he offered my girlfriend's father about $300 or $350 for the ring, which again I thought was very foolish. But then he said, \"Well, look at this ring. It's beautiful.\" I looked at it and it had at least three very large, beautifully formed diamonds and many small ones. Even the small ones were at least a quarter of a karat large. So I remember thinking at the time that gee, we missed a very good buy. I was rather disappointed. That was about the only emotion in the dream, slight, not great, but slight disappointment at the end. The setting was kind of nonexistent. I don't remember setting at all really. Of course, the characters I knew, my girlfriend and her father. I didn't know the man at all."

There were about 2 channels that had late, late shows. My mother was there. She was going to bed. This friend kind of passed through. He didn't play much of a part. They both thought I should go to bed, and I wanted to watch television, so I tuned in this channel, I adjusted it. This woman walked in. She had money in her fists. She had just gotten up evidently in the morning. She looked and like on the table was a letter, an envelope, sealed. She picked it up. She looked at it and it said something like Peach Place in New York, and she had a look of surprise and I forget the words, but in other words, \"Boy, that sure was funny!\" Some old, stupid people addressed a letter to what must be her husband's business or something so that her husband must evidently be a real nice guy who gets into personal relationships with old, stupid people who then send them money to Peach Place, New York. But anyway, it arrives and she opens it and there were 2 dollar bills which she placed in her fist with the other money she had. Then her husband came in, and I could tell they were evidently getting a separation or divorce. That's why she was getting all the money. He was going to leave her his business. So then he said, \"Would you like a candy, dear?\" and she said, \"Yes, sure, let me have one of those, do you have any of those green ones? The butterscotch?\" And I knew that was a real sore point between them. Those green ones, the butterscotch, that was something, some recurring argument they used to have. He said, \"No dear, I don't. I can give you lemon or one of these white ones.\" He really was nice about it. She felt a little bad then, that she wanted the butterscotch. So she said, \"Ok, I'll take a white one.\" That's about it."

So I went over to the cabinet where I have components set up, my own components, and I noticed there was a wire loose from the amplifier and a spark jumped from the wire to the chassis of the amplifier, a couple of inches. I watched and then it jumped again after several seconds, so I was a little worried about that, of course, I kind of stood back to think of what to do. I didn't want that electricity flying around the room. All of a sudden it jumped across the room, perhaps 7, 8, 10 feet to a screwdriver that I have on a desk. So that really got me worried to see a big spark fly all the way cross the room. After another second or two, it flew again, perhaps a larger spark. I could kind of smell ozone in the air, and I thought to myself at the time that the spark must be ionizing the air and this must be creating a vacuum, and that a big vacuum was being created in the room. I threw the screwdriver over by the amplifier, thinking that perhaps the spark would now jump from the amplifier to the screwdriver, a short distance, but by now the spark was just jumping across the room by itself, large. So as I said, I thought about this making a vacuum in the room, so I started to run for the door. Then I thought just as I was reaching for the door, that if I open the door and run away, the spark will obviously get larger and larger out the door and will begin ionizing larger areas, the whole atmosphere, and the whole atmosphere will become a vacuum. But in any case, I thought that, but I still stood at the door and was about to open it when there was a giant implosion. That is, the room had become a vacuum and everything evidently, I guess it passed through my mind at the moment, had blown in from the pressure. Of course, that was the end of the dream. I woke up then or that's as far as I can remember."

I was a stranger in town. I had just come to this town, when I first walked into the pharmacy. The inside looked somewhat different than it actually looks. Actually let's see, there were pinball machines, I think, in the back, and there were some guys standing around that looked like hoods, but they were young, perhaps 18 or 19. So I walked to the back, walked by them, and I was expecting perhaps they would start a fight or something. It was that type of atmosphere, that I was a stranger in town and here were the young hoodlums by the pinball machines, but they just looked me over. They didn't say anything. I walked by them. Then all of a sudden I had a locker there for some reason. Now in the dream evidently, it wasn't bizarre at the time or peculiar, but evidently I had been in town for at least a while because I had a locker there. Inside the locker was a large manila envelope. One of the things I had inside was a razor. I was going into the bathroom to put on lather and shave myself. So I went in and put on the lather and began to shave myself, and I heard someone calling from the outside. I went out, still with lather on my face. In fact, I was still shaving without a mirror. There was a girl there, my girlfriend, though in this dream she was perhaps a causal acquaintance, perhaps a light affair or something, as though I had been in town a few days and met this girl. Then it's very hard to explain, but the manager of the store said something like, \"Hey, we're going to get you because your summons disappeared.\" I was thinking in the dream something about the fact that I had been framed because although I had received some kind of ticket, I got another notice saying it had been repealed, and I didn't have to appear in court, or something to that effect. But the man said, \"No, you were supposed to appear and you didn't and now you're going to jail. I'm calling the police.\" The last thing I remember in the dream was saying to my girlfriend, \"Gee, I've been framed. I've been framed.\" By the way, this relates to the first ticket I have ever got a couple of weeks ago and got an announcement in the mail of a court date."

And later when we were back in the city or back closer to home I got out of the car and I felt something on my pants, and I brushed it off and stepped on it.

It was late at night and I was fairly old, perhaps about 40-45. It was rather indefinite and she was about her age, that she is now. I was a lot older than her. I was kind of trying to seduce her. That is as a general plan, that wasn't the specific plan of the evening, but that was our relationship, one of 40-year-old seducer and young seducee. We were out there in the city somewhere late at night, and we were talking about our relationship a little bit. Of course, she wasn't listening too closely, as any flighty young girl would when talking to a seducer. But the whole point was that I hadn't been able to seduce her yet. I was getting kind of impatient and I thought perhaps this wasn't the best thing for me to try to continue attempting to seduce her. Perhaps she needed something else. I was feeling rather sorry for myself too because I really had a lot of feeling for the girl, and I mean I desired her quite a bit also. In any case, while we were standing there, all of a sudden we started to see a lot of trucks with lights on them going by as we were talking. Funny kind of trucks. Perhaps they were kind of like jeeps. They had a lot of lights on them and they would go by, go by, and finally there was kind of one near us and we walked over to it and I was kind of looking at it. It was like a fire truck or something. Just after we had seen the first trucks go off, took off away from us, these two young guys about college age, that is about my girlfriend's age, not mine, had gone rushing off after them, and there had been some cryptic remark at the time by someone else that it was probably the two frat boy's frat house that was on fire, that all the trucks were going to. So there were kind of fire trucks evidently. So then I was kind of looking under the wheels of one of these fire trucks. I was standing there and I was getting a statement for some reason from the president of the university, a statement to the effect that the statement I had gotten before about the statement that he had given me, were all true. Namely, that it was the case that something or other, but I can't remember what, in other words, I was getting real official statements from the president about statements he had given me so that there could be no misunderstanding when I took him to court or wherever I wanted to take him.

The action which was occurring just before Calvin woke me up was of holding my long fly rod pole at home and trying to wind up the line on the reel. The line is green and it seemed that when I had it all unwound, it was tied to the reel by a double thickness of black cord. The line became all snarled and tangled up and it was very difficult to hold the line straight from the reel so that the cord could be wound on the reel. Occurring at an earlier point, but I think at an unrelated time I was attending a movie and in the movie was this incident where we were viewing the German Kaiser standing at a particular street corner. In the dream you could notice the fancy street signs and the wording on the signs. Then it seemed as if there were some writing underneath this which said that though the war was over, the Kaiser would not step down and although he was not unhappy about disobedience from his troops, that he would not take orders from anyone else. There was a large number of German troops marching down this street at the time, and you could see the Kaiser there first. Then the troops marched by him. Then you could see that the Kaiser had been shot and was lying in the street. Then it seemed as if I were in the street myself and one of the German soldiers yelled to me something about the Kaiser and I said that he was dead. The soldier then asked who now was going to be the next chancellor and I said something about I don't know. Then it seemed as if the movie were over and I were coming out of the movie walking down the lobby with many people around, and was talking to some one person in particular and joking that maybe the new chancellor would be Goldsmith. This is not anybody in particular, just a name I made up because it sounded Jewish. Then I felt a little bad because it seemed as if this person or someone else nearby were Jewish and I was hoping that they would not take offense because I had not meant it to be derogatory. I believe it was after this that the next dream incident took place. The setting was in a drug store and there was a great deal of Christmas activity going on. That is the Christmas shopping season was just coming on, and all of the clerks were busily putting up Santa Claus posters and in a whiskey store that you could see the clerk was busily washing the top shelves and windows and placing bright colored Christmas signs there. Over near one counter was a woman and two or three boys with her, of elementary school age. I don't know from what conversation or action of theirs, but it seemed as if they were shopping early because they wanted to obtain a present for the boys' father who was away and it seemed as if he were in service overseas. The boys were standing at the counter where there were several fishing poles and one of the boys was holding this fishing pole which consisted of alternate green and white stripes on it, and asking his mother whether this would be a very expensive one. She said that yes, this type would be a very expensive kind. And the boy asked something about whether he might get one for Christmas. The mother said no and blurted out that she had already bought them gas tanks which seemed to mean trucks of some sort, and then she was a little sheepish looking because she had given away the secret about what their Christmas present was. A little before this I had said something to the woman when we were all standing around in the store that it was the Christmas season again and made some comment about its business and the activity associated with it. When I heard the woman make the slip about tanks, I said something to her about, \"You mean air tanks, don't you?\" and smiled at her. It seems as if I had my mouth full of candy while I was smiling. I was surprised at my having taken the initiative to say anything to her because this is not something that I would ordinarily do with strangers. It's possible that somehow these scenes might have shifted at this point up to the tangled fish line described before, but there seems to be a longer temporal gap in there. There's also a very vague recollection of some earlier incident which seemed to have taken place a long time ago. This involved something to do with the young girl singer who was bout 18 years old. I remember hearing her sing in the dream, and she had a very beautiful voice, and she was travelling along on a train. As you viewed this train moving along in a movie, I believe someone was saying, \"You just don't hear anyone with a voice like that anymore. A really good singer is somewhat unusual to find.\" There was also some reference to a vacation trip or cruise and this seemed to be either a train full or bus full of young teenage girls who were going to various so-called exciting spots. Somehow the girl singer was part of this other situation, but this setting seems to have been from much earlier in the night."

Then the woman who had first announced this was saying something about you know how it is with women. This is something you were telling us about earlier that when women are under the influence of the egg laying time or drive that they are not concerned with other things. The other thing that they were supposed to be concerned with had something to do with paper, but I don't think it was money. Then some missionaries arrived with quite a few of their pupils or students. As the pupils came through the door, I was handing them something. It seems as if it may have been crayons or bottles of pop. By the time that the missionaries came along, I told them that they were too late. I had offered them this whatever it was before and they had not accepted then, so that now they had missed their chance. This was not said in any strong way, but in a more of a kidding fashion. Then someone took and was trying to feed soda pop to some kittens, but this was not going very smoothly."

When he did, it seemed as if there had been a female assistant outside the room who had heard a great deal of commotion, or heard the pens scratching, and realized that things were not as they should be. She had then gone upstairs to get Roger so that he could come down and take care of the situation. Roger and I then had some conversation while he was reattaching the electrodes. I then was lying here awake thinking that I would never be able to get to sleep. It had become very late during the night, and I was still waiting to fall asleep for an extended period of time. It seems that while laying here awake, that is dreaming that I was awake, I was saying something to myself about, \"Don't come in as yet because I haven't started to dream,\" because I'm often surprised when the monitor arrives as it doesn't seem as if he should have because a dream hadn't been taking place. My thought then was that I would be surprised if a monitor were to appear during what I had experienced as wakefulness in the dream."

At one time there was an impression of looking at a piece of paper and in a sense there were four parts underlined. These were in the lower part of the paper and there was a small one to the left and right and then a larger something to the bottom left and right. The small things were more or less centered over the large things so that the four underlinings had a symmetrical appearance (although they were definitely at the bottom of this paper or page). It seems like they were words, which were underlined, but I can't make them out. It seems as if the group of smaller words were underlined. Then the groups of larger words were underlined as if that was to be the sequence of direction, as if the small one were to be in each case followed by the large one."

Someone was saying that one had to distinguish between the regular kind of object, which was somehow invented in the metal, as opposed to those that were one consistent type of metal throughout. The object referred to seemed to be some kind of cuff link. Then other types of insignia were shown to me, and I was having some difficulty in distinguishing between them.  Then there was a group of armed knights who were sitting upon horses and I was standing beside them. It seemed as if I knew one of the knights more than the others. He was explaining something to me about the difference, indicators of knighthood accomplishment, but the differences seemed rather subtle to me. Finally I went up to this one particular knight, who had been pointed out to me as a first class knight, and asked him to show me how this was inscribed in his medallion or insignia. I walked away from the group with him, and had my hand circled around his waist. I said, \"What did you do to earn your first class status?\" He said that he had decided to run for some office that required some kind of reform work to be carried out. I then asked him, \"Was it that he received the award for having decided to run for this office or whether because he had successfully competed in this contest?\" I believe he said, \"It was because he actually was the winner in this election or contest.\"  Then there was a demonstration of some sort of horsemanship, and it was pointed out that if one were to ride along on the horse and tip their lance into the ground that this was considered poor form. That if one were to deliberately do so it meant that they disagreed with the others. It seemed as if two of the characters now involved were King Arthur and Prince Valiant. King Arthur in particular did seem to even like the idea that one would do this on any occasion. Then it seemed as if, somehow, it was known that one of the other knights was Alita (who was Prince Valiant's wife). She was also wearing a knight's outfit, and it seemed as if some vote was about to be made. Each of these knights, whose identity was to be kept anonymous, was to ride across and indicate by their behavior whether they agreed with this vote or not. If one were to tip the lance into the ground, then this meant that he disagreed. It seemed to be understood that Alita was not in favor of this particular thing that was about to be voted on. She had a somewhat different looking costume than the others, and also seemed to have a broken and splintered lance.  The rest of the knights were down at one end of this field and Alita was crossing the field to join them at the far end. As she rode across, someone was saying something about she would have to vote as she felt and that this would be all right because supposedly the identity of the disagreeing knights was anonymous.  Then the scene shifted to a desert and recall for this part is very fuzzy. It had just started before I was awakened. It seemed I was going to go out on this desert for a week or so, and I was either to be killed by myself or someone else, or else I was to be found by someone. But it seems as if it were to be some sort of hunting situation in which I was to be the quarry."

The child agreed and then it seemed as if my aunt were commenting about the inadequacy of the furniture; saying something was going to have to be done to make it more livable. At another point I remember standing on the back of a chair to do something with this furniture arrangement and nearly toppled over, and this was given as an example of how the furniture should be better supported."

In reality, she used to live across the street from this house. As I am walking up toward the house, there was a Western Union boy delivering two letters to the house next door that my aunt lived in. In reality, this was the Howland house, and one of the letters was for Kirk Howland, a boy who used to live there. They had owned a grocery store on the corner. The messenger boy lifted up one of the letters to look at it, and it seemed as if I could also see it even though I was at some distance away. One of the letters, which was for Kirk, was from some industrial firm and it seemed evident in the dream that this was containing some sort of job offer for him. I'm not sure whether the messenger boy was on a Vespa, or not, but it seemed as if he made quite a bit of noise as he arrived. As I was walking along on the sidewalk, I heard this noise behind me and moved over to the side expecting him to pass, and then he didn't. I looked back then and he was already started up toward the porch to deliver the letters.  I went up to the house that my aunt was living in and could hear a great deal of noise going on inside. What I was supposed to deliver was an orange electrode, which was tied up in a knot. I was unsure as to whether I should just leave it in the mailbox, because it seemed that there were other electrodes lying there in the mailbox, or whether I should ring the bell and present it in person. I decided on the latter and my aunt arrived at the door. She asked me as to whether some arrangements had been made for a particular date that was either for that day or the next day. This was in relationship to some party that was going to be held. She asked whether we had contacted this one relative, and I said,\" No, that we had tried earlier but couldn't reach her.\" (\"Her\" meaning this relative she was asking about.)  Then she asked if my sister had contacted her teacher, and I said, \"No.\" My aunt said she was disappointed about this as the situation with the teacher should have been worked out as it seemed to present some awkwardness at the party. I agreed and said yes, this was somewhat of a difficulty, and I had noticed the tension building up in my sister as she seemed to be more fidgety and my mother had also seemed to notice this. I think I said something about my mother and I had discussed this between us, about my sister's increasing anxiety, but we didn't know what we could do about it. Then my aunt said, \"Well, this isn't any reason that you shouldn't be able to relax and enjoy yourself at the party. This is something your sister is going to have to work out for herself.\"  Then I had the feeling that my aunt had always been this sort of person, of one who had always set high standards and always seemed to feel a little critical toward us as we were not more responsible and more relative oriented. That is we did not seem to carry through with the responsibilities or obligations one had toward relatives."

It seems as if the class actually belonged to someone else but had been given to me because I was so good at remembering students' names and relating to them. The actual setting for the dream seemed to be sort of a large room that combined features of a classroom, a hallway, and a locker room. I was standing there taking off the electrodes and some student from the class was trying to explain something about how a considerable number of the students would be missing that day. I couldn't understand this girl too well because I seemed to be more preoccupied with removing the electrodes, and she had to repeat what she was saying several times. It seems as if the gist of her conversation, since four or five students would not be there in this classroom, then it should probably not be held.  Then she said something that Marti, who was apparently a live wire male student in dramatics, had suggested that since Eugene O'Neill were in town that we should call him up and invite him to come to class. Although it seemed as if some mention were made of class being held in a different location for that meeting. I said that I did not think this would be a good idea, as I really didn't see what our meeting and interacting with Eugene O'Neill was going to have to do with the better understanding of mental retardation, which was what the class was about.  At that point, off behind was a film containing coming attractions of Eugene O'Neill and some other bearded movie actor. I felt that I had seen this movie before so as the various coming attractions were shown I was reminded of different scenes from the movie. Just before Calvin awoke me, Eugene O'Neill, who seemed to be played by Walter Pidgeon, I think, was going thru a scene in which he was saying in a rather low voice something about, \"Don't you think I have any pride?\" As he was saying this, the camera shifted to a view of his dog and the dog was sitting up and sort of making appropriate sounds of sympathy as his master was speaking these lines. The dream seemed to have lasted about 7 to 8 minutes as the basic setting was the peculiar classroom and all the interaction with the girl was taking place while I was removing the electrodes and at the same time the few-selected movie stills or shots appeared.  While laying here trying to go back to sleep after the III REM awakening, I recalled another dream. I'm not sure which REM period this came from, but I believe it preceded the activity described in the REM III for dreams, and it was toward the later part of the night. I had just been awakened to record a dream, and there were 2 male monitors or experimenters. They said, \"You might as well get up anyhow\" because most of the electrodes had worked loose, and there was a great deal of 60 cycle interference. I asked something about cold (in terms of whether the room were cold or whether they picked up something to do with cold) as I had related to that about having remembered a dream during the night in which I was out in the ocean fishing for cod with two other men. We were fishing with hand lines over the side of the boat, and they had already caught one or two fish apiece, and I had not. We had only been in the boat for just a few minutes so I was not discouraged. At one point it seemed as if I had gone in the water myself in an effort to get the line down deeper and experienced the sensation of the cold water. This is what had led to my question about was the coldness recorded. I also said something to one of the monitors about that being a very wise thing to do, to go into the water like that when other fish were being caught because of the possible danger of shark attack.  At this point it seemed as though someone were being buried right on the side of the room in which I had been sleeping. Shovels could be heard digging away in the ground, and the cadaver was waiting just outside the door to be placed in the new grave. I made some comment about making sure that they didn't get the two of us mixed up, and I got out of bed and began to move around. Since the monitoring session had just ended, this dream and the one described in the REM III wakening, I was just starting to take the electrodes off. [Estimated length of the dream would have been about 6 or 7 minutes.]"

It seemed as if it were late at night at that time, and my viewpoint from the lunch counter was looking out toward the street. It seemed that just a little while before the lights had been on out there and people could be seen. But now that the lights had been turned off, it was difficult to make out any figures, but a few people could be seen as they walked by the front of the store. Up near the door seemed to be a greeting card selection and someone, that I believe was Jewel, who is my sort of step aunt, was writing some sort of birthday or Christmas card.  As I was sitting at the counter, it seemed as if it was just about this point in time. That is, that I had been awakened twice during the night, but then the session were over and I had gotten up but was feeling very bad physically. I had a very bad cough in the dream, unless I was very careful to control it. Every time I would speak or breathe this loud raspy cough could be heard. Sitting next to me was Frank Sinatra. Because I was feeling so edgy, I had asked him for a cigarette, and told him that I didn't have a cigarette for about 2 and a half weeks now. As I started to light it up I said something about, \"There goes 17 days down the drain.\" He was smoking some sort of menthol filter tip cigarette as otherwise I was not going to have a cigarette.  Before getting up to the lunch counter, I had seen Frank standing there. I came up to him and it seemed as if he were an old friend of mine in the dream. I asked him if he was still playing to a full house out at Vegas and said that when I had been there last week I had tried to look him up. This last part was not actually so. I had been at the nightclub he was playing in Vegas in the dream, but had not made an actual effort to try and to look him up at the time. He said that yes, things had been going very well there, and he was sorry he didn't see me but there had been so many people in trying to get a hold of him that it was difficult to be on hand. He mentioned that a couple of boxers and various other people had been by to see him.  We were sitting at the lunch counter. Then it seemed as if Frank had excused himself for a while, and I was sitting there smoking this cigarette, but then I was also smoking a cigar and would alternate between smoking a cigarette and then smoking a cigar. A friend of mine from Rochester came up to me in the dream and said that I should stop being a subject in dream studies as I really looked like hell. I acknowledged that I didn't feel too good, but that I was going to continue. As he walked away I thought to myself that he could never be a subject for a dream study as one's unconscious attitudes and motives were important, and that since he was such a highly depressed person that he would never be able to get far enough beyond his defenses to produce any dreams. In real life, Eddie is not this way and I'm not sure why I so characterized him in the dream. I believe it was still to Eddie that I had said something about yes, it was physically demanding upon my body, but I felt that ordinarily I did take good care of my body and felt that if I wanted to push it occasionally and make unusual demands upon it, it should be able to accede to these requests because of the overall proper attention that it received."

At one point he had become annoyed over something I had done, and he shouted at me, did I realize how insolent I was behaving and how dare I have the nerve to have said or done something or other? I was surprised at his reaction because it was such a strong one, and I asked him how in terms I had behaved this way. He said to come into his office and he would tell me. As we were walking thru this one door, I was saying to myself that I didn't feel I had been behaving as nervy as he had suggested, but that he seemed very angry and might fire me, or something of the sort. Then I thought no, he can't fire me, or he shouldn't fire me, because I had been doing good work for him, and he needed some of the skills that I had.  After walking thru a large room, we turned and walked into a door that led into a smaller room. Roger went over and sat down behind his desk, which was in one corner, and I went over and pulled up a chair nearby. I remember glancing nervously at my watch once or twice as I went over to sit down. I was aware that over in another corner of the room, Ken Little was sitting. Before Roger really had a chance to start, Ken Little called me over and said something about it was 1 o'clock, and I asked him to repeat what he had said. It seemed as if he was, and I thought he was going to ask me to give a dream colloquium, and I wanted to get it straight on which day he had in mind. He tried to be humorous by saying, \"What I want you to do is to go down and get a movie immediately and show it.\" I waited for a moment and smiled. Then he said he was going to have to be out of his classes on so and so a date because he was going to have to attend the University Center, and he wanted me to come in and take classes from 2 o'clock and to hold it up thru about 3:18 for him. Then he also made mention of some other class. He was starting to leave so I said, \"What room is the first class that you mentioned?\" He gave me the room number. I asked him then what room the other class was in, and he said, \"That's out in the experimental hallway. Come with me and I'll show you where it is.\"  I followed along behind him but now it seemed as if he were a woman and she was explaining where the various people were located. I asked her where (Rick Shofen?) was, and she said he's down on the 3rd floor. It seemed as if the floor that we were located at was the 4th. We went over in one direction toward where the 3rd floor was, and it seemed as if the way to get down to it was to simply step down off a balcony-like arrangement directly onto the floors of the 3rd floor. She showed me where the names were alphabetized, and little cards were stuck in the books for Q, R, S, T and so forth, and so I stepped down where the card for R was. I was aware of books having been placed upon the seats, and the chairs had bee pushed in fairly close to the table, which suggested that maybe some students had left their books there to reserve the chairs for themselves. As I was placing my feet down on the chairs, I was aware of a great deal of dried mud being scraped from my shoes, and falling on the seat of the chair. Once I got down from the chair to the floor I went back to brush off the dirt from the chair and a partially completed and wrinkled dream report form was lying on the chair. Then I was thinking that maybe while I was using his class I could get some dream data and saying something to myself about that always being an advantage of using the form that providing you had a free association blank for that particular day, you could still always look for some correspondences between moods or feeling of that day and subsequently reported dreams from the night before.

            "content": "I was teaching my class of nurses at the hospital. The first part of the lecture started off slowly as I was busy opening up my mail. There were about six or seven pieces of mail that had arrived. Most of it was junk mail advertising books or containing bills, but I was nervous and seemed to be using this as an excuse to delay the class. I looked at my watch and it was twenty minutes to the hour, which meant that I was ten minutes late. I felt I had better begin. There had also been some comments from the girls among themselves that indicated their impatience for me to start. When I did start it seemed as if I were rather stumbling and halting in my delivery, which seemed unusual to me at the time because usually I do not particularly feel self-conscious when starting a lecture.  Then it seemed as if I were laying in bed giving the lecture. I had some very large thick book about sex and kept telling them that this would be an excellent reference source for them to use whenever they had any questions about sex or if they ever found themselves confronted with doing a term paper or any similar task. This would be the book to use. It seemed as if it had a blue cover and it contained an excess of 1,000 pages. I was going through the book and showing them many illustrations and photographs. It seemed to be that most of these actually focused upon birth. There were photographs showing the infant in utero, in position to be delivered, the pelvic region, brilliant colored photographs of cancer of this region. I had gotten to a point about halfway through the book when I was awakened by the monitor. At this particular point in the book, I was saying to the girls that there was an excellent summary of the various studies there. It seemed that each study was abstracted and the data about subject procedures, findings, etc. was there, and then a critical evaluation by the author of this large book.  The lecture was given from this bed because I had an erection. I seemed to be dressed as I am now. That is, in underwear. I did not want to get out from under the covers and stand in front of the class while maintaining the erection. I did not seem to think about standing in front of them with just my underwear on. At one point during the lecture one of the girls, who is ordinarily quite timid and prudish (who's code name is, I believe, Fruit Basket) raised her hand and asked if she could smoke. I said, \"Yes,\" and then I thought she was not a smoker but if she wished she were free to. Then it seemed as if she were doing this for some sort of retaliation or to emphasize how much someone nearby her was smoking. I looked down at her and it seemed as if she had the ruffles of a wedding dress on the bottom part of her dress as this seemed to protrude out into the aisle, although, I believe, the blue uniform that many of the girls wear was visible for the top part. At one other point when I was trying to get the girl's attention, this same girl was starting to run bathwater, and I had to give her a dirty look and raise my voice considerably before she finally stopped. The girls seemed to be bored during this lecture and did not seem to be particularly interested or involved with what I was saying. There was one girl who had just raised her hand as I reached the part about the summaries, I was awakened. The girl's name I think was Maglio Melio.  I was not sure in the dream why I was feeling anxious, but I was very fidgety at the beginning of the lecture. I was not able to attribute this nervousness to any specific happening or cause. This part of the dream seemed to last about 7 minutes or so.  Another dream was recalled almost as soon as the monitor awoke me. It would have taken place earlier than the nursing scene. It was the experience of having been interrupted in the middle of a sentence during the talk to the nurses. Roger was the monitor and it seemed as if we had just finished up a night's awakenings and he was saying something about there still being a little bit of time left to do something. It seemed as if he were on a large stage and we were talking near the back part of the deserted stage. I was thinking about going to the bathroom but I decided, no, I would go back to bed and use this shorter to hold for some more sleep. He said something about going out through the doors and encountering this certain office, and it seemed fleetingly as if this were tied in with the high school that I attended, either because of the stage or because of the person's office that he mentioned. But it briefly did remind me of something about an incident that occurred with Bret.  Then the scene suddenly shifted and he and I were sitting on a grassy bank of a campus, and I was continuing to tell him the details about Brett. I hadn't realized that during the first part of this conversation, but then there was a person sitting to our side about 10 feet away who seemed to be listening and at one point moved a little closer to listen but never said anything or was not recognizable. Then a man came by with red hair, and I knew he was Brett's teacher, although Brett does not have any specific teacher and none with red hair. I began to walk along with this teacher and then Roger departed for some other destination. The teacher was saying something about it might be necessary that we would be contacted that night because Brett's mother might need to be informed. I said I know about that because I am Brett's father. He did not know who I was because the only way I had approached him was to ask him where Brett Van de Castle's room was. He had said, yes, follow him as he was headed in that direction. It seemed more as if it were a college campus as there were a large number of buildings and grassy knolls about rather than being the single building that Brett's high school actually consists of.  Then the teacher was saying something about kindergarten and a problem existing there because the person who managed the kindergarten was extremely fussy, and would only allow children to enroll whose parents subscribed to The Nation magazine. I said I thought that was extremely snobby because this kindergarten was supposed to be a public state-supported school. If I had found out, or anyone else were to find out, that her child had been turned down from admission to this school because the parents did not subscribe to The Nation magazine that there was going to be a heck of a big ruckus raised. [Estimate time would have been about 4 or 5 minutes for this part of the dream.]"

There were several boats on the smaller lake, and either I was counting them off for Calvin and telling him, or he was counting them out loud. I don't remember what kind of boats they were, but he was interested in them and this counting was going on. Just before this it seemed as if there were some other kind of counting, or tallying going on, but I'm not sure about what it involved."

            "content": "The setting was outside of some apartment building. Doris was working at one end of this building and was scrubbing screens and doing some other kind of household work while one or two children were watching her. I think one of the youngsters was ours, but the other was a stranger. As I walked up to her, I could hear her say something about being very busy and working, and making some remark to the youngsters about how would it be if she put off her work and didn't get it done. Then I walked a few feet away from her and by the end of the apartment building. At that end was another woman with a young girl who was washing large windows there. From her remarks it seemed as if this was a job that was supposed to be done by the management, but that it had been so long neglected that she had undertaken to do it herself. Doris then came down to join her, and the two of them were going to do this chore together. While they were doing this, I was observing some bugs. There was a spider that had come down from the ceiling, and I had knocked it down as it tried to climb up its web on the ceiling and was pointing to Drake, my youngest child, the bug as it moved around on the ground now. There was also some other kind of insect that I was busily watching, and on occasion he would find some insect of his own that he was busy watching. Then the scene shifted and we were by the side of another building, and I remember noting the plants by the side of the building and the various needles that had dropped off of it, and a few occasional buds or nuts that had fallen from the tree. It seemed as if quite a few of my children were with me now, and then a voice was heard to say something about ants. This voice seemed to be from a PA set or was like a narration for  movie. The voice was saying that ants can work for very long periods of time gathering food. It seemed that the needles from the trees lying on the ground were the kind of food that they stored. When this was available, they would gather large quantities of it and store it in their homes. While we were watching the ants, there was a large Indian sleeping near us. He would have been about 5 or 6 times life size. I don't know whether he was larger or we were smaller. Then the voice that was providing the commentary said something about the Indians having lice and then the lice would develop certain kinds of pupa, and then that these pupa would be hatching for a period of time and a description of their life cycle was provided. I believe some remark was made that during one stage of this life cycle they produce some sort of itching or irritation if the young pupa were handled. The children were asking me some questions about the lice and I was commenting on them being on Indians and then that they were not indigenous with Indians or special with them, that anyone could have them. The Indian seemed to be sleeping and had either some tattered blanket or some newspapers lying over him as he was curled up sleeping. I think it was raining very slightly while we were looking at the Indian, and there was a ditch nearby him which ants kept coming out of as they collected the food mentioned earlier. The dream seemed to be about 9 or 10 minutes. There were some more fragments recalled immediately after the monitor left the room. They had to do with some EEG equipment. It seemed that Calvin and I were checking over our supplies and wondering about what to reorder. We were wondering about getting colodium and so forth. I'm not sure of the setting. It seemed it had some resemblance to the center basement room of the Institute here. I said something about getting our packages of beads out. This consisted of a four-sided display of various kinds of colored beads that came in all sorts of shapes and patterns. They didn't seem to be beads as used for jewelry, but were something that could be used with the EEG machine. It seems as if they were something we had bought very early when we first acquired the machine and were not sure of what quantity to order and had vastly over-ordered on this item. As Calvin and I were walking along the outside of this four-sided display, it seemed as if there were some other man in the center of it, and I was asking how much was it that we had paid for this before. And the man replied $12 or something like that. Then I was commenting to Calvin that somehow the walnut panels that some of this material had arrived in or some other supplies could perhaps be used to make a room divider sort of arrangement in this basement room so that the supply area could be closed off. Then there was another fragment about walking into a room and taking off my shirt and placing it over a chair. There were several people in this room, and it also had some connection with EEG, whether I was getting ready to be a subject, this was why I was taking off my shirt, I'm not sure. Doris was sitting over in one corner of the room, and there were two men talking to her. Then it seemed as if Bernie Hyman, who had been one of the psychology instructors at Denver, sidled up to me and said something about wasn't I jealous about two men talking to Doris, and I said no, not at all. It seemed as if this fragment followed the one about the EEG supplies, but where during the night they belong, I'm not sure."

            "content": "I dreamed that bladder pressure had become strong enough that I decided that I was going to get up and go into the bathroom in the other room. It seems as if I had got up and gone out to the adjoining room where the EEG machine was and Calvin was not there. It looked as if the room were all being completely replastered and painted, and all about the room it was all smoothed of as if it had just been trolled over from a plasterer. Up above it was sort of sealed off so that instead of going thru the door into the kitchen, this was now covered over with plaster so it was very difficult to discern where the door was and it had an appearance much more like the trap door going to the roof. I decided that I would first turn off the switches on the machine so that when I disconnected the electrode board, that there would not be the 60 cycle splattering. I was also curious to see how many channels were still operative because I had remembered earlier of a great deal of 60 cycle noise having been there, and at that time I had called Calvin's name once or twice to see if one of the channels could be repaired so that he would have enough information to read the next REM. When I looked at the machine in my dream, it seemed as if he still had the strain gauge and one other channel working. I had disconnected the electrode box and started to walk into the bathroom. But now that room in there seemed much larger than it is in reality, and it was being painted brown along the edges of the rug. The bathroom was also different in dimensions being much larger and thus the room was rearranged so that commode was on the opposite side of the room. Sitting on the commode was someone dressed in workman clothes, although he was not actually using the toilet. Nearby him was another workman and I asked one if I could be allowed to use the bathroom for just a minute or so. He got up and said sure. It was about time for him to get back to work anyhow. I didn't actually use the toilet, and then it seemed as if there were a counter running at right angles to where the commode was and another workman who seemed to be more of a farmer started to talk to me and made me a cup of cocoa. The cup contained powdered milk and water for the milk, but the resulting mixture looked much more like chocolate syrup. In fact it became just about identical to chocolate syrup that one would put on ice cream rather than cocoa. I was eating something during this time. I think it was cereal, but I'm not sure. This large sort of corporate looking farmer was leaning over the counter and was telling me about the whole EEG study, how these here fellows went ahead and put some kind of funny looking wires on people's head and how they put them on different parts of their head and then they could tell from this something about people's thinking. He was saying this is a way almost as if he was trying to closely repeat what had been told to him and the effort appeared to be great, as if he had tried to memorize it almost exactly in terms of what had been said to him. He concluded with the remark that it sure was kind of deep stuff, and I agree with him. The other two workmen, when they had left, they seemed to take a bear skin rug back with them. There was bear skin rug laying nearby them and they each picked it up and had one with them when they left. As this farmer was talking, I was thinking about how narrow he was in his interests in thinking about their basic political conservatism because they had never really had contact with very many other groups or viewpoints besides their own and therefore their political representatives would have to be Republicans. Then two other young men in their late teens or early twenties appeared, and in the dream I knew them very well because they were associated with the dream project. They had gotten behind this counter and were looking about for some paper that they couldn't find. They asked me if I knew anything about it, and I said no, that obviously things were in such turmoil with all of the plastering and painting and things being moved about, I didn't know anything as to where it might have been moved. I was thinking to myself at that point that maybe this would be a good time to find out more about exactly what they were doing, since it seemed they had been connected with the dream project for about a year and were always busy working on some data in connection with it, but yet they were actually separate from the project in that their funds came from some other source and not through the grant that Calvin has. I thought maybe I could get one of them to sit down and tell me more about how they had actually become involved in the project and where the source of their finances arose. The conversation never occurred as I was awakened at about this point. The dream should have lasted probably about 8 or 9 minutes, I guess."

            "content": "At one point in the dream I was lying at one end of a bed and a woman probably in her early 40's was lying at the other end. She was dressed in a nightgown and had fully prominent breasts. Standing by the side of the bed was her husband who was about her age and in the dream I seemed to know both of these people. There was some remark passed by myself, I believe, about the man's dwindling sexual ability and then I seemed interested in playing with the woman's breasts. Her husband said something about you won't find her very responsive and I said something about it being difficult to say whether this was a chicken or egg situation, and I said maybe she would be more responsive to me, and I began to boldly pull the nightgown away from her breasts. This was not greeted with any great objection on her part nor her husband's. Now she was lying on her back on the bed with her head toward me, and I reached over to kiss her breasts. Her breasts appeared to have two separate nipples each, one which was larger and more centrally located and the smaller one below. The breasts seemed much smaller and flatter now. She was masturbating her husband at the same time, and sometimes it seemed as if her head were in front of me, that is, stretching away above her breasts and at other times, it seems as if her head were going the other way so that her head was underneath me, and close to the region of my genitals. The settling shifted to a large auditorium and there was a boxing match going on. There were two young lightweight boxers who were fighting and one of them was doing much better than the other. It seems his opponent became vanquished and then another lightweight contender got into the ring with him. This new contender now started to give a pretty savage beating to the other boxer who at one point kind of started to use a double punch where both hands would be brought from the outside and would simultaneously hit the other boxer's head at the same time. My sentiments began to be for the underdog, and I remember standing up and throwing a few imaginary punches myself because I was so involved with the action in the ring. The one boxer started to give these double punches, the other then became very annoyed and began rushing at him blindly and landed a couple of very nice punches on his opponent. The other fight fans also seemed to be pulling for the same person I was and this boxer had become so angry that he was now taking and using his elbow to hit the other about the neck, and would throw kidney punches from behind. It seems as if I were with somebody during the fight because I would occasionally make comments to this person about what was going on in the ring. This person said something about the new auditorium next door. After the fight another man came up to me who I didn't recognize, but he seemed to recognize me immediately and said something about it being good to see me there, and had I been over yet to see the new auditorium. I left and went outside and was supposed to meet Doris then. I walked along and noticed her talking to two men over on the far side of the building I had just come out. It was dark then and she did not recognize me at first, but then she perked her head and seemed to and started off toward me. She had on a trench coat and I asked her about this and she said that one of the men said that she could keep it. I commented on this and said that seemed unusual. I could see letting her borrow it, but why had he given it to her? She said it was because of some sort of defect that was in the coat and that when she had explained about her ratty shawl, that then the man gave her the coat to go with it. At this point it seemed as if we were near a college campus, and we walked up over a little hill, and while doing so, I was thinking about dreams. And thinking about how strange it was the form that they came out and seemed to be so jumbled and mixed up when ordinarily the body seemed to work so smoothly and precisely and with such delicate balance. Then it seemed as if one of the things I had told Doris to do was to buy a large number of lemon trees and to plant them. As we went over to sit on the side of another hill, I was aware of small twigs that had been planted in systematic lines about 12 inches apart over the whole hillside. I was a little annoyed, though, because some students were sitting around on the hillside and I felt they would squash these newly planted trees. As we were sitting on the hillside, we could see things down below us. Some Congressman and someone were saying something about President Johnson not working hard enough; that it was unheard of for him to be able to sleep thru for 12 hours when the Congress had cut his budget, and that any man who could rest this easy when things were going wrong clearly didn't have the drive to be an efficient president. Then someone down on the far right of the lower row of the Congressman was saying something about he would speak to the President and acquaint him with the facts and get him operating the way he should be operating. This person appeared fairly young for a Congressman and I asked Doris if he were a presidential page or how he would be on such particularly close speaking terms with the President. Then from a nearby building voices were heard coming down and a woman's voice was saying, \"Did you hear about the enlightening speeches that Republicans had made last night?\" and somebody sarcastically replied, \"What Republicans?\" It seemed understood in the dream that all these people were also congressmen. Estimated length of the dream appears to be 12 or 13 minutes."

            "content": "I was seated at a table with Bill, his wife, and two other males who were not recognizable or were never identified in the dream. We were sitting around having lunch and most of the conversation was being dominated by Bill. He was talking about their future. He said something about they could go up to the Great Lakes where his father was apparently in the Navy, but he referred to the Great Lakes by some different term, although from context it seemed clear that this was where he was referring to. Then he was saying something about, well, I could go and stay at his mother's, but that this had problems associated with it. Then something was said about his working, such as he would have to work until the kids were so and so age before this other thing could be done or expected. Then he made a remark about his wife, somewhat along the lines of, \"Could you imagine that she could ever go into a building or be involved with an association without the roof coming off or the building collapsing,\" or some such. This was said with a kind of nasty, sarcastic tone, and although I had said very little in any of the conversation up to this point, I entered momentarily by saying, \"Yes, I think I could imagine that something like this could occur.\" And his wife seemed pleased, but everybody else at the table seemed to stiffen and an air of tension was present. Realizing this, I tried to reduce it by saying, \"Well, you asked if such a thing could be imagined, and since you had said it in that way, I could, if I thought about it, imagine that this might occur.\" People started to smile and it seemed as if the tension were broken. We had just about finished up the meal when I glanced over and noticed that Bill had a great deal of gravy around his mouth and chin. In the dream he had sort of wavy hair and a rather thin triangular face and somewhat thick lips. His hair was sort of a light blonde in color. It seemed as if there were a strong wind blowing, and I remember after drinking the milk in my glass, I was hesitant to place the empty glass on the table for  fear that it would blow away, although when I thought about it, it seemed a little unusual because the other glasses were empty and they were staying in place in this wind. I believe it was Bill's wife who then started to clear the table and start to prepare some dessert. Then the scene shifted and Calvin, Bill and I were walking along. It seemed as if we were going to go for the mail. Calvin said something about what time should it be. I said, well, it should be about 12 o'clock because it was such a nice day, it would be nice for it to continue on; but it actually was about 1:40. Just before this point, there had been quite a bit of conversation and interaction between Calvin and Bill. Then it seemed as if Calvin glanced nervously over toward me because he was worried about my being felt left out or something, but these were not my feelings and I was thinking to myself that Calvin too quickly jumped to seeing jealousy as a possible motive in many situations where it did not exist. Then Calvin left for the mail and Bill and I were walking along together. Then I tried to make some conversation with him by saying that he had a little boy and girl, I understood. I was surprised by his remark because he seemed to take a nasty turn when he said, well yes, his wife could manage to have children of both sexes when he understood my wife was somewhat deficient in this regard. I thought in my own mind my attitude had been one of openness and friendliness toward Bill, and I couldn't understand why he had this chip on his shoulder. But I decided I wasn't going to let it get to me and I just responded in a way as if I were not aware of the hostile implications of his remarks. It was at about this point that the monitor entered. Estimated time was about 7 minutes. There was some other fragment in which a good guy was going to be shot. I think the good guy was Tarzan, but I'm not sure. There was a large rectangular barrier out in this field and the assassin was to jump behind this on one side with a rifle and shoot this prominent person as he came by on a bicycle, I believe. There were two or three other men around, and it seemed as if this was supposed to be a rehearsal for a movie, but then its sinister purpose was revealed. Then the setting changed to be in a movie house and now I had the rifle and the task was to try and quickly shoot this person as he rapidly moved down the aisle from one end of the theater to the stage. I was seated right in the center of the theater. This person would be at one end, and then I don't remember through what means, but would rapidly approach me, whiz by, and then rapidly move toward the stage. His whole journey would only last a second or two, and it became very difficult to shoot him because as soon as the rifle were raised as he approached, he was there, and then by the time one's stance was changed and the rifle were moved and aimed after he went by me, he had disappeared behind he curtains of the stage. This was structured as some sort of contest. It seems as if the man were going to make ten passes and this was to be a test of my marksmanship skill in front of the audience. Recall is much more fuzzy for this episode, but it was fairly vivid for the Bill one. Estimated time for the latter fragment would have been about three or four minutes."

            "content": "One part that comes back was standing in a hallway or rather alleyway of a large auditorium. The word I want is aisle of a large auditorium. In the auditorium were a large number of prominent people who were all seated there on wooden seats. In some ways it seems as if this was set out of doors, but I'm not certain of that. It seems I had just walked over toward the aisle and was pulling a piece of tape off of my throat. I had some difficulty doing this, and after I took the tape off, I looked at it and it was the same flesh-colored tape we use here, except part of it was completely transparent like Scotch tape, and I wondered if the flesh-colored part had still adhered to my throat or Adam's apple. It seemed that Jimmy Durante had just got up and had to leave the theater in a hurry, and then someone was saying that if they could be anybody in the whole world, they would like to be Jimmy Durante because he was such a  fine person and so well loved. Then I looked throughout the audience and it seemed as if Cary Grant were there, and I was imagining someone probably saying that they would like to be Cary Grant if they could be anybody in the world, because of his distinguished good looks and his overall handsomeness. Then I was sort of asking myself who would I want to be. It seemed as if I were wondering if I wanted to be Calvin because of all his scientific productivity and then his theoretical writings, but I don't believe I ever answered the question. The setting was in a basement, I believe, because it involved a cold storage vault. There were a large number of valuable furs in this one room, and I worked there in some capacity. It seems as if there were two shifts of girls involved here because one of the girls was just getting ready to leave. She was a young, attractive sort of red-haired girl, and as she was coming out of this one room of the vault, she said, \"Oh, are you still here?\" I said, \"Yes, you know me. I'm always on the job.\" She then prepared to go home, and she said something to me that I cold not quite understand, and I asked her, \"Did you say A or B or C?\" B referred to alarm clock and A referred to something much more suggestive of sex and C was a completely neutral choice. I said, \"Which of those three things did you say? I have a preference in terms of what I hope you said,\" but it seemed as if she gave the neutral word. Then I said to her, \"Well, maybe someday I'll get to hear your alarm clock,\" and she seemed to be slightly embarrassed by what I had said. Then it seemed as if there were some other man in the vault with me, and he was saying something about I was trying to make time, and I said, yes, I didn't seem to have gotten very far, but this gal was warming up a little bit. Then some other girl appeared and it seemed as if it were her shift that was now starting. I said something to her about, \"Your accent seems much more southern today than it did yesterday.\" I said something about, \"You really are a you-all type today.\" I believe she mentioned something about having visited with her parents or her in-laws that day and they were very southern, and so this is why she was talking this way now. Then I noticed the coats that were hung along in the storage vault, and I thought that since this was not very large and it was expensive to store things there, that they should make more efficient use of the space than they did. There were several spots that were untidy and things had been sort of scattered about. Somehow this vault seemed connected with sleep research because this first girl seemed to say, \"Are you still going on with the sleeping or dreaming?\" and in that sense it seemed to have some kind of lab aspect to the vault. Then the setting shifted to a top story of an old building. I was talking on the telephone to someone who I believe was named David Peterson. I was trying to write down some information, and it seemed like as I talked to him, I was reminded that I had talked to him earlier and had written down the information that was needed, but I now couldn't find it because the papers were all scattered about and the desk or area nearby was untidy. Then I apologized, saying that I had just gotten up from being a subject. I was kind of fuzzy in my thinking. Then I momentarily felt that this was a bad thing to say because we were thinking of using him as a subject, and this might scare him off if he thought that there were some sort of adverse aftereffects to it. But then it seemed as if he were calling me because he was at the University of Miami and wanted to do a dissertation on dreams, and it was to be on the effect of cold, acids, or cold solutions of some sorts. Then I asked him to repeat the information in terms of where his meeting was to be held and what time. I said that this time I would make sure that I got it written down. He said that it would be held on November 16th, and I said that would be easy enough to remember because it was my birthday. Now what place would it be? He said he wasn't sure, but it seemed like it would be so and so place. Then it seemed as if I was still talking, but the setting shifted very slightly, and I was now standing up with my elbows on some sort of desk, and I was near an open window looking out the window. This fellow started pressuring me about the exam that was to be held about over his dissertation, and he asked how thorough would he have to master the literature. I said he would have to know it very well but we would not ask him specific questions on it like what did Schwartz do in 1957. At this point it seemed as if three girls from my nursing class walked behind me, one in particular who I think her code name is Charlie the Tuna, and they were all laughing over this conversation and seemed to be amazed at the lightness involved and good humor that was being displayed because they did not expect this kind of attitude or conduct from their teachers. They expected a much more harsh disciplinarian. Then I was explaining to this fellow that since he's going to be doing a dissertation at the University of Miami, we certainly expect a competent job to be done, etc., and all I could tell him was we would be asking questions more about his design in terms of why did he use a certain kind of statistic or some other kind, why he had used the controls he had used, and that nobody was out to give him a bad time. If he had a fairly solid design and presented it, that was all there was to it. At this point I looked down below into the street and Alan Sternberg, a student who had also been in therapy with me, was walking by and seemed to be looking up in my direction, and I thought I hadn't seen him in some time and thought that he was looking for me. Then the conversation continued with this student and he finally said, \"So what?\" I just answered him back, \"So what? What do you mean, so what?\" Then it seemed that the setting shifted to the front of this room, and now this student was there in person. He was heavy set with a reddish brush cut and one eye that seemed perhaps to have a glass eye, freckled, timid and not too bright-looking. Here were a couple of other people scattered around. One of them seemed to be the chairman of the department, and I think it was Calvin who was the chairman. I think there were two women present and then some older woman who was in her sixties came in who was explaining about the mail or where her records were kept. I seemed a little unclear on this, and then one of the women said, \"Well, we keep them straight across the hall because the main departmental offices are in another building and because it's difficult to get over there, we have sort of a mail service here in this building.\" Then there was some discussion about how handy it would be when the department had another separate department headquarters in this building. It seemed as if the department were ready to branch out to two divisions, and I agreed that it would certainly be more handy when it was located there. Since I still seemed to be unsure about these records, Calvin sort of nodded and one of the women got up to go over and get the forms or material for me that seemed to be needed. Then the setting shifted again, and Calvin was saying something to me, but he seemed to be demonstrating the point by tapping lightly on my lower abdomen, which was making me annoyed. Then it seemed as if Calvin were in the room here and I was relating a dream to him, and we were having a discussion about dream or something related to it. All of a sudden I heard the EEG machine stop, and I said to him, \"Did you run out of paper, because the machine was just running and now suddenly it's stopped.\" He looked at me and sort of smiled, and said something about, \"Well, you knew that I would take care of everything the way it should be taken care of.\" Then Calvin did walk into the room in reality to awaken me. Estimated time would be about 10 minutes."

            "content": "The first part of the dream involved Cuba, and a voice from somewhere seemed to be providing the commentary asking about when is someone finally going to take action to release all the royalty from Cuba. It seems as if Cuba had somehow imprisoned large numbers of reigning royalty, and this was a news commentator who was expressing his dissatisfaction over our weak position and failure to act upon this matter with regard to Cuba. Then I was walking along the streets in Cuba, and as I crossed the street, I noticed all of these people lining the streets and I knew that they were the royalty. I was curious about them and started to move in their direction, but then a rather old, seedy-looking man who was the guard, started to approach me. I quickly exited because I was afraid that I would be caught and made a prisoner myself. The guard was carrying a gun, but was old, probably in his late 60's or early 70's, and I was surprised at this because he didn't appear to be what one would ordinarily expect for a guard. I had a fleeting look at the royalty and they all seemed to be dressed the same, in fatigues and combat boots. They were sort of shuffling along and looked extremely dejected and miserable. Then I was wondering to myself about their rather sorry-looking condition, and thinking that one would never know they were royalty from their appearance, and thinking that royalty was not very proper because the only claim to fame for most of them was that they happened to be born to influential parents and had not really done anything to receive commendation for themselves. I was saying to myself that if they really had any strong character, they should be finding some way of pooling their resources to escape. Then the scene shifted and it was some kind of hut. I was continuing to say something to myself about what sort of qualities could be inherited. In the hut was a large, well-muscled, vicious man who was chained to the wall. It seemed there were also one or two other people chained to the wall, but nowhere near as impressive in physical size or apparent ferocity as this one figure. Some man walked by them who had the reputation for toughness and walked up to a counter, I think, at the end of this hut to order something. As he walked by the chained-up giant, he threw an ice cube at him. I was saying something about dominant and recessive genes, that experiencing cold or some other kind of thing was related to dominant characteristics. It seems as if the ice cube had hit this giant or large man in the face and he spit the ice cube back out, and some of it landed on my face. I became furious and started to hit him with both fists in the face. Then he started to punch me. I spit at his face, and he continued to punch me, and I decided that no matter how hard I was hit or how much punishment I received that I wasn't going to quit, and that I was going to continue to spit back in his face It seems as if I had received this courage or decided to take this stand because I wanted to impress the person who had walked into the room, down toward the counter. I don't know who this person was in the dream. Here was something else about what would happen afterward, but I don't know what this was. What would happen afterward to me? It seemed as if it were more what would happen to him after this incident. By I mean the giant. Time [end]"

            "content": "The dream started with a conversation between two men. One of them was Charlton Heston, who was a young rising lawyer, and I'm not sure who the other man was. Heston had some big trial coming up in which he thought he would make his reputation. He was saying to the other person that if he could win this case, he would then be voted as the outstanding lawyer of that region, and this would go a long way in achieving this particular title or national recognition that he was seeking. The other person asked him if he realized how difficult that this would be and how many skillful lawyers had previously failed in winning a conviction. Heston replied that he did, but said that he had new information, that he had got this thru extensive wire tapping and it seemed as if these wire tapping devices had been hidden all about various army spots, and there was one picture of somebody from the Air Force putting on a helmet and as they were doing so, Heston's voice was saying even in their helmets which they think are their most private possessions, a bug has been hid. Then the scene shifted, and it's a little fuzzy, but it had to do with possession of a boat. I believe Gilbert Roland, the movie star, was the owner of this little boat. This boat lay in a harbour and the way that one got to it was throwing a line over from shore which caught on a chain stretched across a log, and by pulling on this, the boat was pulled over in such a way that the gang plank or buoyant plank type of arrangement was provided. There was quit a squabble over who owned this boat as the boat was still in the process of being paid for. There were some women connected with this boat, and it seems in some fashion as if they were tied up with the previous trial, but they were going to try and get some further information. It seemed as if I were a friend of Gilbert Roland and was standing nearby when a couple of women and an old man somewhat short in stature arrived by the boat and, with a great deal of fuss and a great deal of noise, managed to come over and get on board. I said something to Gilbert Roland about what are they doing. He said they are trying to take the boat. I said of course they can't. Then someone stood across the desk, the deck. A small card which, upon reading it, said that if proper notice had not been given, as to something when payments were started on the boat, then the rights to ownership were jeopardized. Somehow these other people had discovered this and were using this as a legal gimmick to take over the boat. We had to take off from the boat and watched rather sullenly as they all boarded the boat, which was aluminum, and up in the cabin area it could be seen that it was fairly well used as there were dents in places where paint had been rubbed off. It seemed that the purpose of this was to try and attain the boat primarily for the old man, who was a fisherman. There were nets nearby, black nets, that had sort of had gold-colored weights distributed along their edge that we used to throw in the sea. I was curious about the weights and went over and looked at them, and noticed that they appeared to be made of hollow glass with one side open, that there was a great deal of sand packed in them. Then the old man got on some small kind of velocipede, something that had a motor, and that had one wheel at the handlebars. It was very small and unlike anything else that I have ever seen before. He got on this and began to drive forward a bit and then to try and back up. He was having trouble. He drove forward a bit again, but was not very skillful in maneuvering it and then finally he got it backed up and headed off. As he did so, I said something to Gilbert Roland about hadn't he put he wheel in the wrong direction. Wasn't the wheel supposed to be in the front as he drove, rather than behind facing on the velocipede as he was? He said that no, the way the man was driving was alright. This is the same old man connected with the boat. It also seemed as if the velocipede had changed hands in the transaction. Somehow the loss of the boat changed our plans and it seemed as if new evidence had to be obtained. So I was saying to some other person who was concerned with this, but who was not Gilbert  Roland, well, let's go out and start to get familiar with some gals who would be involved so that we could hopefully obtain some information from them. We started to g thru the neighborhood hoping to spot some females. On the back porch of one sort of rundown looking house there was a young girl with a sort of blotchy complexion, but a face almost completely covered by freckles who appeared near the back door. It seemed as if I vaguely knew this girl from some other connection, and I said to her, \"Did you know that you really look quite different from the picture I had seen of you?\" And she said, \"How?\" I told her that she was really much prettier than she had been in this other picture. I sat down on the steps and she came over towards me and sat on my lap, and I began to kiss her. I was a little hesitant to do so because I thought for some reason I had bad breath, but I then kissed her and she did not know how to respond very well and started to giggle as well. It seemed then that this other person who I knew appeared and said , \"She looks like she's all of about 12 years old.\" Then I said in a somewhat facetious fashion to her, \"No, you kiss as though you must be a 13-year-old girl.\" Then I felt guilty about taking advantage of her naiveness and lack of experience and left. As I did so, she seemed disappointed and I said, \"Well, I will come back someday and see you again.\" As I left I remember walking into some other hallway, and it had a torn screen door, and I said back out through the screen door to her, \"Well, it has been different anyhow.\" Then as I began to walk down the hallway of this building, I looked off to the right and noticed an old man dozing in a chair as if it might have been a room of a private club. Walking further down the hallway, I glanced in this one room and saw Karlis or Mrs. Garrett, and some other person whom I recognized. All of these people are associated with parapsychological activities. I waved to them and seemed to know that the parapsychological convention was about to get underway that afternoon or the next day and thought that when they noticed me they would probably wonder why I was all dressed in fatigues. It seemed I had been out on some difficult mission, and this was an occasion for having a complete set of fatigues on. They were somewhat muddy so I decided I better go back to my room and start to get ready and cleaned up for the convention. As I walked along I noticed over on the left hand side a little brass mask hat had been painted orange and a great deal of the paint had peeled off. This was lying on the ground along with some other pieces of bric-a-brac. There were various people in the hall as I passed along, and then it seemed as if at one point I encountered Carlos again, and I started a discussion with him, but he seemed preoccupied, in a hurry or something, and I thought, \"Well, I'll have a chance to talk to him during the convention.\" As I continued to walk down the hall, I approached the door that was to be my room. This was a door on the right hand side and it seemed as if it were slightly ajar. Across the hallway there were some people. They were commenting something about the unusual decor that was in my room. Someone was saying to the others sitting in the room that if you get a chance when the door was open to look thru because it was furnished quite distinctively. As I pushed open my door and started thru it, I was aware that some large piece of furniture had been pushed away from the corner of the wall more toward the center of the room, and there was a woman busily washing the dishes. The room had been cleaned up and I was pleased over this and that things were being tidied up. I thought the woman was probably Doris, but she had her back away from me, and I was anxious to see who it was when Calvin awakened me. There was also a fragment about going to see a movie. I remember going into the movie with some other person and the ticket seller had pushed the two stubs into my palm. The person I was with was quit a few feet up ahead starting to look for the hallway or entranceway into the main theater. It was a very large theater and somebody was calling down asking he ticket seller how do they get to the certain floor, and he was trying to give them directions, but he was not sure which floor it was that he was on. Then someone said to him, \"Well, this is the 4th floor.\" I believe this other person with me was a girl that I seemed to know in the dream, but I'm not sure exactly who she was. I have a feeling she was a red-haired girl who is in my student nurse class. As we entered the theater, we sort of kept going down various dead ends and had trouble finding the proper floor. At one point we emerged at a restaurant, and I just glanced around the corner and noticed that there were several people sitting about in wicker chairs at this restaurant. I believe we finally found seats someplace and sat down. I have a vague feeling the title of the movie was supposed to be Dr. Newman, M.D. This is a picture I believe that had been mentioned in my nursing class as being one to do with psychiatrists. There was the feeling that psychiatry was also somehow tied up wit the initial part about Charlton Heston and I did not appear to be part of that actual setting so that it may have been that once arriving at the movie, we were seeing this scene with Charlton Heston and the courtroom part, although I was a participant in the rest of the dream. This seemed like a very long dream and I would estimate it as 15-20 minutes in length."

            "content": "There were two male newscasters present and one of them was reading the news. He came across an item dealing with some new scientific information about oceanography, but had difficulty with making these statements so he ended that particular piece of news, so he continued on with other information. After a few minutes when he had finished with the news, he then said, \"Now, I would like to give you the information about that other news item which was a little bit garbled before. Here is the way that statement should have read.\" He then proceeded to very carefully read this off. Now it seemed as if there were some other woman present at the same time, and both of the male announcers were there carefully looking at this skirt while the announcement was being slowly read.  One word they were having difficulty in pronouncing was cataclysm. It seems as if they were saying that this is past tense of the verb to something and the word seemed cataclysm, but that isn't an infinitive. At the conclusion of this broadcast, there was some sort of contest where the announcer who had not been involved with reading the news, was now giving out some sort of information and then people were supposed to react to this with questions or comments or something to his statements. This woman who was mentioned earlier was going along and asking some different questions. It seemed as if somehow there must have been other people standing nearby or involved because none of them were saying anything. It seemed as if there were a little bit of annoyance at this woman because she was much involved with the question, and then the news announcer reminded that there was an $8 prize for the person who had asked the most questions or cooperated in whatever fashion it was that was expected of people in reaction to this information. The next part of the dream seemed to have involved some sort of intrigue or spy element. There was some earlier part that I can't recall as I'm not sure what information it was that was supposed to be kept secret or who all was involved in the plot. At this one point it seemed that a group of people were together. One of them is a friend of mine whose name is Dave Long and then there was some attractive woman who looked like one of the nursing students. There were several other people involved. They were all in the room and then it seemed as if Dave and this woman were the principle culprits and they were trying to escape. They were on some sort of subway like device or else an elevator that ran sidewards. They were supposed to get off at this one particular stop, but they didn't. Instead the machine that they were on which seemed to look more like the elevator arrangement inside whizzed by this one stop and the people inside seemed to be hardly aware that they had rapidly passed by. Then in order to throw people off the track, he decided to get off with this girl at a dentist kind of place thinking that no one would ever look for them there. It seemed as at one point when they were moving along in this vehicle that they looked out and there was a large auditorium filled with about ten or twelve people scattered throughout all of them very busily picking their teeth with a toothpick. When they stopped to get out of this vehicle it seemed as if I were there and it was some form of hallway. As Dave went by, I think it was myself than who had a bowl of brown cereal and I attempted to deliberately smear this on him so that he would have to alter his plans slightly. He was wearing a suit and I did manage to get quite a bit of this brown cereal all over the bottom of his right sleeve. He was annoyed over this, but then he and the girl started into this large room. As they got down to the end of this room, it seemed that Doris was there and she was saying something about coming into the room or being time to come into the room. This seemed to take place just before Calvin came thru the door or perhaps even before he had come thru the door. The momentary fleeting impression might have been to do with it being time for him to come thru the door. Time would have seemed like 11 or 12 minutes as the news broadcast took a while to unfold. In terms of the news broadcast element, I appeared to be an observer throughout all of it except for the terminal part when I was a participant in terms of being in the audience. During the chase scene it seemed as if I were participating in a fragment I can't recall. Then I was an onlooker as the car went by its one destination or stop point and could see the car going by and see the people looking out the glass doors of the station where they were supposed to have gotten off. Then I appeared to be a participant as it seemed as if I were in this car looking out to the auditorium where the people were picking their teeth, but then it seemed as f I were both participant and onlooker in the latter part. I could see myself being in this hallway when they had emerged from the car."

            "content": "I was getting ready to leave for classes to teach the nursing students. A lunch had been made up and also the material I was going to need for class that day was deposited in this container, which was sort of like a combination brief case and lunch container. I got onto the bus and it seemed as if for some reason I was wearing a red straw hat. There were a few other people on the bus. Shortly after starting out, the bus was going rather slow and we passed up this one girl from nursing class that I was supposed to see this afternoon. The bus passed very close by her and I waved to her, and although she looked in the bus and looked at me, she ignored me as if she did not recognize me. I thought this was possible because I did have on this red straw hat, but I thought she still should have been able to recognize my face. That hat was something like a farmer's hat, not a dress hat. I was almost thinking about getting off the bus and walking to the classes because it seemed very lazy to ride what was apparently a rather short distance, but then I thought, \"Well, it'll be worth it after all because I'll get there so much earlier and I can then get ready for class.\" I (flatuated) in the dream and in order to put as much distance between myself and the two girls who were sitting in a seat in front of me, I laid on the floor and held on to the bottom of the seat, but it seemed as if by doing so I was being dragged along the pavement itself. The bus was not moving too fast and it was not too uncomfortable, but one of the girls turned and looked over her shoulder and commented to the other about the unusualness of what I was doing. I felt it very unusual myself in that it was slightly uncomfortable being dragged along that way. I thought I was getting my clothes slightly dirty, but I felt this was still more preferable to sitting that close to the girls if I was going to continue to flatuate. Then one of the girls seemed to like this idea and she was starting to lay down on the floor of the bus herself and was motioning for her friend to join her, but instead of lying stretched out on their stomachs, they turned around and curled up facing towards me. Just about this time the bus pulled into the station at the school, and I started to get out. There were some Coca Cola stands nearby and it seemed as if students were buying cokes now to put away for their lunch time. This reminded me about food and I dashed back toward the bus to pick up my combination lunch container and briefcase that had been left behind. As I walked past the Coca Cola machines again, I was annoyed that I only had twenty cents with me. I thought that I really should take more money with me as 2 cents wasn't really enough to take care of anything unexpected that might come up during the day. Then I was unsure of where my class was going to be held. It seemed as if it were supposed to be in room 2 which is down in the corner on the bottom floor, but I for some reason thought it wasn't going to be held there that day. As I started in the building, I noticed one male student who had two different shoes on. One was a blue sneaker and the other one was a white one. They were both somewhat old and worn out, but I thought that he must have salvaged the best remaining member of each of the two pairs. Then as I started to walk up the stairs to the second floor, it seemed as if I took off my old shoes and let the water splash out of them onto the stairs. I don't know how they got so much water in them, but when I turned them upside down quite a bit of water did come out. In some ways there seemed to be some resemblance between this building and the elementary school that I had attended. At some point I'm not sure exactly where, but it seems in and around here, Calvin was saying something to somebody about their being castrated, and when he said it, the person just kind of smiled and seemed to take it as some sort of compliment because the impression that he gave was that he certainly did not understand the meaning of the term. I looked at my watch and it was now 8:30, and I was beginning to worry a little bit because now was the time that class was supposed to start and I still hadn't located the classroom. And it seems as if I certainly should have known where this classroom was. This was 8:30 in the morning. As I got down to the end of the 2nd floor, I was going to start through and go back down to the 1st floor again and check on the corner room I thought it was, but I was delayed in passing thru because there were several people talking on the telephones and I couldn't pass by them. There were two people at one end of the table talking on telephones, and one person at the opposite end. The cords were stretched out so far that you couldn't pass by them unless you wanted to either climb under or over them. Finally one of he people hung up and I started to go thru the gap that now existed near where he was sitting. After I did so there seemed to be large numbers of piles of paper carefully stacked around by the top of the stairs. There seemed to be about 7 or 8 little papers in each pile, and as I stepped toward the top of the stairs, I tried to be very careful not to disturb their position. Then somehow the scene shifted and I was now in a cafeteria line. As I was starting thru the line, I was beginning to move along and a man probably about 40 years old was behind me and he said something to the four or five women who were standing behind the counter, \"I'm castrated. I know so by ESP.\" The women did not seem to catch on to what he was saying, and so he said it over again, \"You see, I've been castrated, I know by ESP.\" The women made some reactions to this, and I thought to myself that this was a very odd thing to say in public with no more provocation than to just spontaneously blurt this out. Then the first woman that  encountered as I walked thru the line said, \"Tell me that you want coffee.\" I said, \"All right, I want coffee.\" Then I got a small steak and a I think it was some peas and carrots, and as I got down to the end of the line, I was getting worried because I thought I only had $2 with me. The cashier at the end said it was $2 even and I took out my wallet and found a $5 bill and about three ones and thought that Doris must have placed some extra money in my wallet, and I was pleased that she had done this. I took out the$5 bill and gave it to the cashier, and she gave me the receipt and two dollar bills in change, which seemed to be the right amount in the dream, although she had clearly said a total of $2. Then there were two dimes lying on the counter by her, and I wasn't sure whether they were mine or not, but I reached up for them and as I did so, some other guy reached for them at the same time so that we both quickly retracted our hands and neither one of us took them. The arrangement in this cafeteria appeared to be that women carried the tray over to your table and the woman carrying mine had already left and I could see her down at the far end of the cafeteria to lead me to a table so I assume that she had left my tray down there. I was somewhat annoyed with myself for being so extravagant and felt that this was too much to pay for a meal, and I could have done it much cheaper someplace else or brought a lunch. Estimated time of the dream would have about 10 minutes.  Back during the dream as I was starting down the stairway past the stacked piles of paper, I reached the bottom of the stairs and some newspaper reporter seemed to recognize me as a psychologist and yelled down, \"Is it true that some kinds of Negroes and Yogis are able to live without food?\" and I shouted back up that no, I didn't know of any instances where people were able to get along without any food. The newspaper man seemed to be with a crowd of other reporters and he was saying something like \"No, I meant is it true that they don't like food?\" and I said yes, of course, people would differ in their reaction to food, that some people made a great deal of it, and for others it was sort of an unpleasant chore or necessity that one's attitude toward food was learned."

            "content": "I was taking an examination for a Fulbright type of scholarship. There were about a dozen of us, all males I believe, sitting about at desks struggling with the questions to some exam. I don't remember any specific exam items, but I remember finishing up and feeling pleased that it was all done. Someone in front of me asked what it meant when it said \"Country of Origin,\" and I said that meant which particular foreign nation you wanted to go to and didn't mean where you were born, as it sounded. Someone else in the front said, \"Don't give up yet; there's still more time left.\" I replied it wasn't a matter of giving up, but I had answered all of the questions and was just through. Someone else then said, \"Well, if you have a score of 51 or 52, you probably passed.\" It seemed as if there were 100 questions to the exam. Someone then asked me about a particular item and it seemed as if it showed a cover illustration of a girl high in the air on skis, and I was feeling very tired and sort of silly and said yes, it looked like this girl was going to come over and hit this other person on skis who was at some distance away on the illustration. A few people laughed and I said, \"Yes, it would appear to have been drawn rather poorly. It doesn't look as if the perspective is right.\" Then I pointed out some street up ahead and said, \"According to the way that's drawn, that's where she would be coming down and skiing right there.\" Then the scene shifted and we -- there were about 7or 8 of us who had been taking the exam -- were at the top of a hill and walking down it, but we seemed to be walking down a steep street. As we were doing so, I yelled to the others, \"Look over there at the ski slope on the right. That's the girl that was in the illustration.\" There were a group of about 7 or 8 skiers off to the far right and the one that I pointed to was a young Negro with a white shawl around her head and who was moving rather awkwardly. The others laughed and I said, \"Yes, that's the girl.\" Then we were crossing a street. It seemed as if the light were green for us, but cars were still coming from the other direction and traffic was fairly well jammed up. I yelled to the others to be careful when we cross over because cars are still coming along, but I also encouraged them to cross now if they could because it seemed as if traffic would be even worse later on. Estimated time would have been about 6 minutes.  After Calvin left the room I recalled another small fragment. It had to do with living in small cramped quarters. I remember the bathroom being dirty and being down on my hands and knees scrubbing the porcelain or tile floor around this bathroom and then thinking that the only other room there was a very tiny bedroom and trying to imagine what it would be like to live in such a small place with no kitchen and no place to sit down for any great length of time. It seemed as if I were now living alone and was considering this as a possible room, but thought that it was so extremely cramped that it would give me the screaming weamies before I could ever manage to stay in it for any length of time. There was one other little brief fragment which involved finding one of my boy's bowstrings. I had a bow and had been using it and was saying something to Doris, I believe it was that I was going to hang the bow on this particular T-shaped frame, and in the process of doing so, discovered that a bowstring we had been looking for a long time around the house was wrapped around the handles of this frame. It seems as if I had been using the bow for a period of time before placing it there."

He spoke very low, so low that I couldn't hear him, and for some reason I began to think that he was saying something that related to me or to Doris, and I was annoyed because I couldn't hear what he was saying,and the rules were that everybody was supposed to speak up and give a frank statement. The setting shifted and some of us were sitting in a parked car, and we then decided to leave. It seems as if we decided to leave because the incident just mentioned because a crowd had begun to gather, and we did not want to attract that much attention. As soon as we got out of this car, which didn't appear to be ours, a couple walked toward it and then thegirl got in behind the driver's seat and the boy got in on the other side and they started to maneuver it so that they could finally get it away from the closely packed area that it was parked in because there were cars tight up against it. This seemed to be from a setting back in Rochester, N.Y. because some of the street scenes and houses looked similar to an area back there. Then we were walking along toward Cointon Street, and I saw this one rather attractive blond nurse standing alone on the corner, and I was hoping for a minute that she would be one of the nurses from my class. As we walked closer, there seemed to be a small restaurant on the corner which there had been in this area of town, and there was a great deal of sort of frantic activity"

The sheets were all disarrayed and I noticed some holes or tear spots in the pajamas of my youngest cousin, and was thinking that at this young age, if one could see the genitals it really didn't make for much anxiety on either side, that is the observer and the observee's side. Then I was sitting on the edge of the bed and my aunt came by. She too seemed really younger than she is now. I felt some slight embarrassment in relationship to my aunt. I'm not sure whether it was because I had some sexual thoughts about her or what. As I was sitting on the bed, I had a loose leaf notebook cover over my lap because then I was thinking about how difficult these girls were going to eventually find it when the implications of the castration complex and menstruation reached them. In the dream the reality of the castration complex seemed very strong and it now seemed most natural that this would represent a traumatic area for girls to adjust to."

            "content": "The dream seemed to start in some television or radio broadcasting room. There was a disc jockey there who was doing some publicity stunt on dream work. He was lying in this unusual bed which seemed to be very long, had boards which could be pulled further out at the bottom to extend its length. It seemed like I had slept in this bed before because as I looked at it, I was saying to myself that the bed looked much more uncomfortable than it had been while I was sleeping in it. This disc jockey got out of the bed and had electrodes attached to various parts of his body, and I remember 2 or 3 being attached to his leg. There were 2 or 3 male assistants around who were excitedly saying something about if the electrodes were applied any longer than about an hour before the broadcast was to begin, then they would dry out. That is the reducts in the electrodes. I then asked the disc jockey about whether they used reducts because I noticed one electrode that was loose from the tape on his leg, and he said that they didn't use this to record the disc jockey's dreams, and it seemed as if he said then therefore then don't use an EEG, but that the disc jockey was to be the -- I'm not sure now whether it was the sender or receiver  for the ESP experiment. Something was said about in this way he provided a passive screen so that everyone in the audience could now use him as a recipient to receive the impressions, but it also seemed as if somehow he was supposed to be a sender trying to influence all the people out in the audience. Then I felt a little bit uneasy over being associated with the program because I had thought earlier than it was supposed to be a straight scientific demonstration of sleep and dreams and now it seemed as if the station were doing some kind of poy controlled ESP work with the idea of getting a great deal of publicity. Then I was standing near the top of a stairway and trying to tell this person about some experiences that we had had here at the lab with ESP. The disc jockey seemed uninterested, and at one point there were a large number of other people on the stairs. It was so noisy that I sort of had to shout to them in order for myself to be heard. It seemed the ESP experiment I was mentioning involved having received an impression about some alcoholic and then I was telling the disc jockey that there were many points of correspondence because in real life I worked for a lush, and then although the dream was not that exactly corresponding the fact that I worked for an alcoholic and so much of the dream content involved a situation of being involved with an alcoholic in a work situation that it was rather surprising. He greeted this rather blandly and did not seem to be really interested in working with a subject very thoroughly, and seemed to find having to deal with it scientifically rather a bore. Then the scene shifted to the top floor of a building that was very warm. The sun was entering from the one side and as soon as you walked into the sunlight of the room you were aware of a very oppressive heat. There were a group of young teenage school girls hanging about. I wasn't sure for what reason. I was waiting for June Chance to appear who had been one of my instructors at North Carolina. After a rather considerable wait, she did appear and seemed to not pay very much attention to me when she did see me there waiting at her desk. The desk was a very large one, and very high. I was disappointed because I had not seen June for quite some time and always felt close to her before. After she had been carrying back several different groups of papers, I was still standing at the desk waiting for her to return so I could talk to her briefly. It seems as if I was going to check if she had any mail for me and at that point the breeze blew across a little pink slip of paper with my name on it and it said that there would be a phone call for me at three o'clock this afternoon. When she returned, I asked if my mailbox were there, and in a rather annoyed tone she said no, of course it's not. Then I tried to inject some lightness into the conversation by saying her fate must have something very important in store for me because it blew this slip of paper over so it must intend some great message for me at 3 this afternoon. She gave me a very cold stare as if what kind of nut are you. It was at about this point that I woke up. Estimated time would have been about 8 minutes. One thing that June said was that she had looked over the packet I had submitted with photographs in it, and that I was being very much like the Europeans. I was being far too compulsive, and it seemed like what the photographs involved would have been pictures on both sides of the photograph and what I wanted to draw attention to with my written description was a particular girl with long dark curly hair who was sitting in a classroom. I said I wanted to be this specific so there could be no possibility of mistaking which particular girl since there were also girls on the other side of the photograph. She said that wasn't necessary. Anybody with a grain of sense could understand her from the description without getting that detailed. Another detail in connection with the disc jockey mentioned earlier is that he was rather tall and thin and the particular point that the electrodes seemed to be attached was his left lower leg. One of the electrodes was loose and he reattached it by simply taking the piece of tape that was already there and now sticking it over the electrode. As he did this, I noticed a vertical white stripe on his leg, about an inch and a half long or so, which indicated that he had been wearing a piece of tape there for several days so that now when it was removed, some whitish looking skin could be seen. The electrodes seemed to be attached down somewhere near the ankles."

            "content": "I was lying in a bed in a different room. The bed seemed to be at right angles to the one that this is, and someone came in who appeared to be acting as the monitor. It was a very tall, powerful-looking person. Then he said, after looking at me and thinking I was asleep, that it was disgusting, absolutely disgusting, that anyone would sleep to this late hour in the morning. He seemed to be dressed in some sort of military clothes which were rather bunched up and sloppy. The room had some very strikingly colored furniture which I think I had painted and I think the colors were red, black and yellow, very vivid. Then it seemed as if I didn't know what color the walls were going to be because now the walls were orange and green, so it made quite an intense kaleidoscope. There were two other people in the dream who I seem to know and they went off through one side of the room when they thought Dick Jones was coming. They were trying to hide from him, and he went along, it seemed, through the same door and then came down around another room and appeared at a door which would have entered into the original room, but there was an orange kind of curtain there and he became sort of irritated because he couldn't find these other people and was muttering something to himself. It seemed that this was somewhat more than in a playful sense that they were trying to avoid Dick, but I'm not sure what the situation involved. Then we were riding along in a car and Dick was driving. He was driving through extremely heavy traffic. It seemed I was sitting somewhere near the back of the car, but also it seemed somehow as if I were above the car or sitting on the roof because I could notice how extremely close, within an inch or so, he was passing near other cars. There were about 6 or 7 high school kids who were riding on horses in the traffic. The street (Clinton) involved here seemed to be back in Rochester, and every once in a while cars would have to turn off of the other side and that these times sometimes the kids on horseback would slow down and let the cars pass, and at other times they would try and gallop ahead, which made a great racket on the pavement as they would do so. These kids were all yelling and fooling around and obviously in a frisky kind of mood, and so I thought it was very inappropriate for Dick to be driving as fast as he was and to come as close to some of these horses as well because they could very easily turn sidewards because the kids did not appear to be very good horsemen. These kids were both male and female. As the kids came up behind us on horseback I turned around, half expecting to recognize some of them, because for some reason I thought some of them might be the nursing students. I think it may have been after the first scene that the following one occurred. I had woken up from a dream study and these two girls about 17 years old were there. I knew them both in the dream and seemed to be more attracted to one than the other. It seems as if the one I was most attracted to was more familiar to me or was a girlfriend or something. I kissed the familiar one in a very brief sort of pecking sort of fashion a few times and then finally kissed the other girl once or twice. The more attractive one seemed to have a very slight pot belly and blond hair, where the other one had dark hair. I was rushing around in a very animated fashion and kept sort of patting them and pecking them and saying, \"You got to stay awake now.\" It seems as if they had some sort of connection with the dream study and somehow in the dream it seemed acceptable, as if I would be a in different state of mind, and I was sort of taking advantage of this to pretend a great deal of excitement and energy, which then gave me an excuse to frequently shake these girls and then to kiss them. It seems there was a bed or something similar nearby, and I pushed the blond girl on the bed and kissed her. Then the other one was also on the bed, so I kissed her too. Then at one point I said, \"Let's try something. Let's have both of you lie as close together as you can, then I'll see if I can kiss both of you simultaneously.\" They agreed, and I remember had their faces turned toward each other so that it was possible to kiss them both at the same time. Then I jumped off the bed and said that I was getting rather excited and maybe we better do something else. In the next scene I was walking down the street with Doris and the kids. As we walked along, there was some girl sitting in a car, a high school girl, who said -- I'm not sure whether it was to me or to Doris -- that she was so glad she had talked to whoever it was because she had been thinking about going to North High School, and after talking to whoever it was, had been encouraged to go to South High, and she did and found it great there. She said there were a lot of others there too. It seemed as if she's referring to there's a lot of other Italians there as well. As we continued to walk down the street, we came to a very large Pure gas station, and off to the right was a building with people sitting up on the roof, and Marti Fromm was one of the people. It seemed as if she owned this building, and she and all the others, men and women, were sitting up there sunning themselves. There was a very large parking lot around this gas station, but I was sort of ignoring that Marti was sitting up there. I walked in and now it seemed like a restaurant and Nick G., an acquaintance from Rochester, was the head counter man. There was someone else there that I also knew from Rochester. They were kind of giving me a good-natured razzing about something. Then someone said I better check in the large refrigerator that was there and see if some of my food was there. It seemed that I had been shopping earlier and had a large number of groceries with me, and for some reason had kept some of them in this refrigerator. As the refrigerator door was opened, I was looking about at various things, trying to decide whether they belonged to me or not, or whether they belonged to Marti. Then Dorothy Pope from the Duke Lab was there and her hair was very gray and she wore it in a funny style where the part in the middle went straight back and the hair hung down directly at the sides. She said something about, \"You know how fussy Marti is about the food. She always feels that people are taking food from her, so make sure you don't take anything that would be hers. I said something about if there was any question, I would give her the benefit of the doubt, and leave the food there. At this point Marti appeared at the far end of the restaurant and glanced over toward us, but did not seem to recognize me and so I didn't say anything to her and she left. Another incident involved eating oysters. This one girl who was from my nursing class was there, and she was telling this other girl about having just bought some oysters. She said it was the simplest thing in the world. You just went to this store and gave the name of it, just bought the oysters and that was it. I was thinking about this in terms of the unusual taste that some people develop for food and thought that I had never eaten oysters, and I wondered what they would taste like and thought they must be fairly good because so many people seem to really relish them and go to great lengths to go to some oyster house and dip them in sauce and so forth. Estimated time would have been about 13 or 14 minutes. The two people in the early part of the dream trying to avoid Dick Jones were in their late teens and I think it was a boy and a girl, but I'm not certain."

            "content": "I had been a subject in a dream study and had just finished a prolonged series of continual awakenings. I had gone into this apartment where there were two other men, one of whom seemed like Eddie Collins, and I was starting to describe what we had been doing with the dreams that night. There had also been another dream subject, but it seemed as if he had only been involved for part of the night, and had not spent anywhere near as long a time as I had. I was telling him about the ESP aspects and he looked at me with a deep frown and a when are you finally going to get over that stuff sort of irritation look. I was describing to him some of the dream material, but I can't recall what it was I was detailing to him. Then the other dream subject started to get cleaned up, and I was going to also, but then I realized I didn't have my clothes in the apartment and would have to go back to the school, which seemed to be like the elementary school I attended now, to get dressed. I looked at the clock and noticed that it was about eight minutes after 12 and started to become very panicky because I knew I would have to leave right then almost to make my 12:30 class. There was some kidding about a particular girl, and we kept using her name. I don't remember exactly what it was, but I was saying I was interested in her and was it okay if I started to pursue her. Eddie and one of the others was discouraging me from this and I was saying something about couldn't you stand the competition, that if she were really fatally and desperately attracted to me, why should she be denied this opportunity. It seemed as if I was walking at this point along a short section of crowded street, and for some reason bent over and noticed this woman's legs. They were very fat aned vericosed veined, and I thought she isn't too bad looking as seen from above, but if one looked closely at her legs, these very ugly varicose veins were apparent and the flesh looked sort of segmented. Then I rounded a corner. It now seemed as if I were in a car. I stopped it sort of in the middle of the street near what appeared to be this elementary school I attended in order to get out and hurry and take a shower and get cleaned up for class. After I started away from the car, I looked back and realized I could never leave it in that place, so I had to back it up into what I think was a fire station, come out again, and then park it in a regular parking spot by the school, and as I went into the school, there was a red-haired boy standing near the top of a truck, and then the truck was a series of barbell plates and steel bars that were all connected together. Down on the floor were several dozen barbell plates and some more of these joined bars forming separate squares. As I walked by, the red-haired boy who seemed to have just graduated from high school yelled something to me that he and a couple of others were going out to the West Coast. So I waved to him. I said, \"Good luck, Red. I hope that you like it there on the West Coast.\" But then I noticed that he was coming over toward me to shake hands. As we shook hands, I repeated what I had said before with a little bit extra. Then I walked into this large shop area and people were all busy scurrying about doing work. I saw Eric Shopler, a boy I knew in high school. He looked very serious and preoccupied with this job that he was doing. I yelled some kidding remark to him, but he never replied at all. I went over to my workbench, which was located over in the far corner of this room and was thinking that I had to get my bicycle together because somehow I knew it was in all separate parts, that I had disassembled it earlier. I reached up and took off of the bench a handkerchief which was wrapped up, and inside the handkerchief were several of the nuts and bolts that would hold the wheels and handlebars on. Over the loudspeaker came Danny Kaye and he was singing some song which was excerpted from a movie. In the movie the song was played when a 16-year-old son lost his father, and this was the background music at the time. Danny Kaye was now saying, \"Then now isn't this a beautiful song, folks? Listen to it and see if it doesn't express a beautiful sentiment.\" Then the words to the song appeared and they were something about how I'll never see you again. This moment has passed and our contact can never be returned. I thought the incident involved a rather deep or profound thing when somebody had just lost a loved one, and yet it seemed as if this were being treated in some sort of popularized or vulgar fashion in the song. I was really beginning to get anxious about the time now and tried to hurry out of the shop to where I knew the bicycle parts to be. As I was leaving, there was a moment that was very strong in which I experienced separation; I don't know from whom or what, but very intensely for a second or so. I felt alone. I began to feel rather nostalgic when I realized that Red and a couple of the other recent high school graduates who were in the shop were leaving, and I thought this was always a bad time for me when graduation occurs and friends move on to new spots. Then it seemed as if I were out walking with Calvin, and I still had not got to the shower as yet. We were walking along and he put his arm around my shoulder, which made me uncomfortable, and after a few steps I sort of slid away from under his arm as unobtrusively as I could. He mentioned something about meeting and the person was named in Mexico to get the EEG machine. I was asking I'm still not clear about this Calvin. Is one of us supposed to go down to Mexico to get the machine or is it going to just be sent up from there? Then I was either wet or had been perspiring, but my hand was wet, so I reached down to rub it in some sand which was nearby. At that point a Japanese appeared who was very short and stocky and completely bald, and Calvin wanted to introduce me to him. It seemed this person was somebody we had been discussing earlier and Calvin was scheduled to talk to that afternoon. The person reached out his hand and I noticed that his hand seemed to be rather narrow, and I apologized to him, saying that my hand was very sandy because I had just dipped it in sand. But he said that was perfectly alright. I was also surprised by his handgrip because Calvin had said this person was a weightlifter and he obviously looked very powerfully built. In fact, somehow or another, we seemed to know that he had just come from the gym. But it was a very weak handgrip that he displayed. Then the Japanese said something about had we contacted Gather yet, and it seemed as if Gather was supposed to be the first name of the person from Mexico, but his last name was not Pratt as might be suspected from the first name. I believe I left and Calvin and this Japanese fellow continued in the opposite direction. There was some other one fragment about one time I was driving a very large truck and was coming up to turn this corner which was awkward because it was like a tractor trailer type because there was another tractor trailer pulling out from this street that I wished to turn into. Finally the other truck turned off away from the direction. That is, if the street were east, this truck came out and went to the north. I was waiting on the south side of this to turn into the street. I did manage to turn the truck in by swinging it very wide around the corner right after the other truck left. I was a little anxious that maybe if a policeman saw the poor way I was driving the truck, he might say something to me about it."

            "content": "There were a large number of incidents that don't seem to be very well connected except that several have something to do with an impending invasion or war. One of the incidents that seemed unconnected with the war took place in a large house, and at one point I was standing by the entrance to a doorway and Brent, Lance, and I believe one of my other children were there, and one of them was crying because some of his possessions were stolen and he was saying that this particular boy must have stolen them because this boy was in the house at the time that this would have occurred. What were stolen were some small trucks. At another point I was standing in the kitchen of this house and it seemed as if there were another man and woman there, and some Englishman. The Englishman was performing some kind of tricks, and he said something like, \"Now I'm going to put some potato salad in the candelabra,\" or some other foolish thing like this. I asked if he would really do this, and the woman replied that he sometimes did zany things like that. I also remember being very hungry in this house and going to the refrigerator and taking out a slice of watermelon that was mostly white and had very little pink in the center. At another point I also took a loaf of frozen rye bread, put it down in one of the cupboards where the woman said that the bread should go. Then there was something to do where I felt ambivalent about taking more food from the refrigerator and it seemed as if the house now might have been the Institute. And I felt in some ways that I belonged and I felt in some ways that I were stranger to the building. I thought that these people might think it odd if I very freely helped myself to the refrigerator, but on the other hand I felt that I should feel comfortable enough doing so and I was very hungry. Somewhere along this time there was a letter that I was reading from Alan Sternberg and in it he was mentioning a visit that he had a couple of weeks ago with me. And in the letter he also mentioned Rhea, a girl that I know. Alan was planning a trip here a few weeks ago, but it never materialized. In the letter he was saying something about how friendly the atmosphere seemed at the Institute and I thought to myself that I must have been very skillful in not indicating anything about the tension that had existed between Calvin and myself lately. In most of the rest of the dream I seemed to be traveling by car up and down bumpy roads. At one point I pulled off this main bumpy road and parked in a little lane to the side. I stopped the car. Doris was up somewhere near the main road busily engaged in some activity and I was carrying on a conversation back and forth with her. I was seated by the right hand side, though, and the window was closed, and she had some difficulty hearing what I was saying very clearly. I tried to roll the window down, but had some difficulty because the winding handle was slightly broken. At another point there was a large pack of dogs near this area who were all traveling together, and I remember looking down the road and thinking that if the enemy did come now, then that would be signaled by all of the dogs starting to bark, so that they would serve a useful warning purpose. It seemed as if our dog were among all those that were running around. I drove down the road and parked again at another lane, and before doing so passed a sedan in which a man I had seen earlier in the dream appeared. For some reason I thought this a Western Reserve student who had done a dissertation with Calvin, and I thought it was Polster for some reason. Earlier in the dream it seemed as if he and I had jockeyed for some parking position, and now as I was starting to pull in this lane, he was parked there and wanted to start out from this parked position, but hesitated because there was a car parked behind me. When I pulled up to this lane, it went sort of up to a little hill like, and as I did, I noticed an elderly woman sitting in a parked car there. As I got out of the car, it now seemed as if it had turned into the Vespa and I remember kicking the stand underneath it. The place that I had stopped was near some house, and there were some signs saying \"Weird Incorporated\" as if it were some sort of haunted house. Off in the distance was the waterfront and there was a peculiar kind of dock that let out a short distance into the water. At the end of the dock it rose up into the air at a 45 degree angle and now playing on the dock was my son Craig. To get out to this dock I stepped out on a cement partition and then had to work my way around on this partition by holding onto a rather shaky trellis. There was also a thorn bush that I initially grabbed, but then by holding onto the trellis managed to work my way around this partition. After rounding it, I started to step across a ditch that was filled with water and had a board running down the center of this. The board looked like it was anchored, and I was hesitating whether to step on this board or whether to try and jump across this trough in one jump. I jumped over and as I did so, I heard some voices. The voice sounded like Gardner Murphy, and so I looked down to see who was talking. It seemed as if in the trough the water was not there now, and there were about 5 men dressed in costumes of the Revolutionary War period. One of them who seemed to be George Washington was speaking to Benjamin Franklin, and it was the Benjamin Franklin person who had the voice of Gardner Murphy. Washington was chewing him out about not having been prepared and hadn't he realized that he had to get more up-to-date with his methods of record-keeping and his economical planning and so forth. Franklin accepted this fairly well, although he was saying as had been implied, that he was completely unaware of these problems and had made some measures to deal with them. Something was said about sewers, and I believe it was at this point that there was another change in setting where a group of men were receiving instructions that the sewers were to be prepared because when the enemy came, this would be an important detail. There were a group of 5 men. Two of them got into a Jeep which began to back up, and 3 of them started to walk, heading out to the area which seemed to be some ditch that they were then to do something about, either putting in sewers or repairing sewers. As they left, they were wading through some water a couple of inches deep, and there were also a large number of hoses that were lying around in this shallow water. It seemed as if one of these men were a movie star, and it seemed as if it were Jack Carson. At another point up near the field where the dogs were mentioned earlier, I saw Brett and some other boy cutting grass in this rough field, and it seemed that I thought what they were doing was somehow connected with this war project, that by cutting the grass along the sides of this trough or gully that this was somehow preparing the way for the men who had been sent out to do the sewage job. The invasion which was supposed to be imminent was very vague except that everyone seemed to be expecting the arrival of a large number of men to appear. Some of the activities mentioned were to be in readiness for this attack. In the conversation with Doris in the car, one of the things that I was mentioning to her was that I was having a great deal of difficulty falling asleep. I told her that while I was being wired up, I was so sleepy that I could hardly talk to Max, and was yawning and that I had said something to him that when I went down, I would probably not be able to sleep. And I was aware of having been awake a great length of time before being able to fall asleep."

There was a large number of people standing in front of a house and people were taking turns singing songs. These were not Christmas carols, but individual songs. The person in charge of the group and standing in front of him was a woman. I believe my sister was standing next to me, and during this part of the dream it seemed as though I were a teenager. None of the other people in the group were familiar. Some young girl about elementary school age was singing a song while we were standing there and singing it rather badly, somewhat in a PTA fashion. I remember pivoting back and forth in the place that I was standing, sort of hollowing out a spot in the snow with my feet while doing so. Then it seemed as though my attention were focused on the house in front of us. It was a large, white house, about a 3-story house with many stained glass windows that could be seen. While looking at the house, it seemed as if I were now an adult, and I was concerned with the problem of selling this house as it belonged to Doris and me. Some other family was living there at the present time, and I was thinking about all of the problems of trying to sell it and having prospective buyers view the house while this other family was living there. I remember thinking what a relief it will be when all of the confusion is finally over and the house is sold and we had closure on the property."

            "content": "The events in this dream seemed very mixed up. There was something about two trios of soldiers that seemed to rotate about and were more or less constantly engaged either in marching or fighting. In some ways it almost seemed as if they were toy soldiers pivoting about around a central axis, but in other ways it seemed as if they were actual people. There was something to do about the quality of the steel that was used in their swords and the particular brand of Scottish steel that was used by one group was supposed to be the finest in the world. The activities of these soldiers seemed to be drawing to a close when it seemed as if there was supposed to be one more sword stroke delivered in this sort of two hand chopping fashion, but it was decided for some reason that this was not to be done. I became impatient at this point because I wanted to see this final stroke delivered and see whether it would cut this other object of hard metal in half when it was struck with the Scottish steel blade. It seems as if then I was the one who picked up the sword and started to raise it over my head to swing it. As it struck the object, the scene shifted and some other people and myself were ascending a winding staircase that was lined with stones. A conversation was going on between myself and what I think were two other people. Some kind of intrigue was involved, and one of the people, who was male, I believe, said something about going into a hotel room and suggested that we should all do so, and then I could give them some practice exercises to carry out in order that this secret act could be accomplished without any difficulty or mistakes. I don't know what the nature of the activity that was being plotted consisted of. There was something  to do with a younger, about high school age girl, being protected when this blow was struck. This was accomplished by her father protecting her with a car door in some fashion, and I felt annoyed that this girl was supposed to have something unpleasant happen to her and it was warded off by her father's protective act. Then the activities shifted to climbing the stairs mentioned before and discussion about this girl took up part of the initial conversation between us while on the stairs."

It seemed as if I were standing at some counter and looking toward some large TV set. The counter is somewhat like what we have at home, except that in the dream this was a longer u-shaped one. It seemed as though my children were sitting along this counter, and Lance was diagonally opposite me. At one point he began to cry and complained that Drake had done something to him. He was writing something on a pad and I said to him that he had started the situation by saying something or doing something to Drake first. Then for some reason it seemed it was supposed to be 9 o'clock on a Friday night and there was some show just starting. The show that was just starting seemed not to be one that we wanted to watch, and someone said something about getting a different channel. What appeared on the screen was a male Negro who was saying something about his not having done it. The person in charge was trying to get information about what had happened, and it seemed as if the setting were on the deck of a ship. Another male said something to the man in charge of the ship, which seemed to implicate the Negro again and then someone said, \"Well, we're right back to the beginning again,\" in terms of trying to understand how it began or what happened. Then the scene shifted to an apparent medieval setting as there were knights in armor sitting on horses. This one knight appeared to be talking to his horse's tail. There was some woman there dressed in very full and elaborate clothing and she said something to the knight and then began to ride away. The knight said something to stall for time and as she drove away, she bent backwards towards his horse and began to say something to his horse's tail. There was something about his horse's tail becoming entangled with an adjoining horse's tail. There was also some element in which the viewing perspective changed and it was something about if one slid a file forward and through it slightly, it would bump into the top part of one of the horse's legs, and this would cause him to start running. That's all I can remember."

At one point we had to go through a rather narrow roadway, and she was questioning whether I would be able to drive the car through such a small area. To make it along this roadway, the driver had to squeeze past an open door and then turn sharply around a post with very little space between them. It seems as if there had been some plan that I was to take her out to my motel or some other spot, and she was expressing some uncertainty as to whether she should accompany me. I hoped that she would, but since she seemed to be so worried, I told her to forget it and that I would drop her off someplace else. The area we were driving through was unfamiliar. Then the scene shifted and I was in some sort of restaurant by myself. There was some machine there for dispensing coffee, except that in this case it was Nescafe and you had to et the spoonful of powdered Nescafe out of this jar which projected from the machine. As I was leaving, I picked up some toothpicks and put them in my shirt pocket, and noticed that I already had 4 or 5 toothpicks in my shirt pocket from before. There was also something about a badge and inserted in a slot on this badge were some tickets which read, \"Coconut Grove.\" I noticed that there were several tickets folded together which were then slid along the grooves of the slot. Then the setting shifted again and I was going along a wide street which for some reason at the time was supposed to be Monroe Avenue, a street in Rochester. At one point it seemed as if I were now driving my VW bus along, but then later I was walking along this street. It seems as if I were looking for a house that we had lived in, in the dream, and had painted up and fixed up, and I wanted to see how it now looked after we had left there. The house was a large, three-story one and I was noting the numbers on the houses trying to figure the block that it should be in. But then it seemed as if the house would have been on some street parallel to the one I was on rather than directly facing this street. At one point I noticed people in a swimming pool, and later on when I asked a young boy about 12 years old whether the bus came out this far, he answered something about a particular person went swimming every day about quarter to 5. I don't know why I asked about the bus because I was planning to walk to where my car was parked and then to drive home from there. It seemed as if I had just gotten through having been a subject at the Institute and the trip home was the one I would make after leaving the Institute. While talking to this boy, there was some involvement with a board that was placed against the curbstone and I was going to pick it up and carry it over to the other side of the street. And he said he would take it and use it on this side of the street. I don't know what purpose the board was supposed to serve."

            "content": "I dreamed that I was supposed to give a talk in Chicago on parapsychology. Some group had invited me out and were going to pay expenses, etc. for a talk which was to be given on Thursday night. I remember being in the depot and at first it seemed as if just Doris and myself were there, but later on just as I was awakened, I was buying tickets for the children and myself, and Doris was not accompanying me. At one point while we were in the depot, it seemed as if it were a train depot. Doris and I were trying to decide how I should wear my hair. She has been encouraging me to try and comb my hair forward, and in the dream she was suggesting that I should part it with two parts and then cut it short and wear it combed forward. I remember at one point trying to walk along carrying my suitcase and it was difficult to do so because it seemed as if my leg muscles were very sore and cramped. In the dream I attributed this to the after effects of some running I had done the previous day. Somebody mentioned something about the way I was walking and I tried to walk more naturally, but it was extremely painful to do so. At one point as I was walking along with the suitcase, I saw Doris ahead and she came over to join what was a friend in the dream, some blond female, but I don't know her in real life. And then Doris, the blond friend and I began a conversation. It then became time to leave and it seemed as if Doris had bought the ticket as I remember looking down at the suitcase and seeing a white label with a ....erter that said.... on it. Then we all went down the escalators to the floor below so that I could leave. But when we got down to the bottom, it seemed as if the blond had been carrying the suitcase which now seemed much smaller and with an old Scotch plaid fabric on it. We realized that this was the wrong suitcase, so I sent Doris up the other escalator to get my bag, which was a larger bag, but also had a Scotch covering. I told Doris that I would head over for the exit, which was exit number 20. The odd numbered exits were to the left, and the even ones to the right, so I headed over to get in the line. But the line was for a bus and I could look out the open door and see a small blue bus which was about the size of a city bus. The blond woman had gone over toward the odd numbered exits, and Doris came back down the escalator. I called to her to come and join me over here and to bring our friend along with us, or rather along with her so that I could say goodbye for it was getting very late. Going down the escalator, I looked up at a large clock that said 25 after, I'm not sure which hour it was. It seemed that even though there was a luggage ticket on the suitcase, I still hadn't purchased a ticket as I thought Doris had done that earlier. Then I realized this had not actually been paid for. I remember that I only had one dollar in my wallet, which is what in actuality I had in my wallet before coming in tonight, and so I had to step out of the line to let some other people purchase their tickets. There was an older lady who stepped right up to the window right after me, then another group of people and someone was buying 5 tickets for them. And then I asked Doris for some money for the tickets for myself and for the boys. I remember asking the ticket man if a two-year-old child had to pay, and he said no. In the dream it seemed as if one of my boys was only two years old. Doris said she had some money as she had just cashed a check, and somewhere near this point I remember unfolding a very dried-up, dusty twenty-dollar bill. I was trying to ask Doris for information as to what routing she had attained for me, whether I went via Cleveland and then changed to some other kind of transportation, or whether I went all the way to Chicago on the Erie bus. Also at this point two men pushed along in front of me and I remember looking at a map they had in their hands, and it said it was a map of Vietnam that was somewhat water-soaked. And the coloring on the map had run. For some reason in the dream it seemed as if I had the impression of having recently been in Vietnam myself. Just as I was asking the ticket man as to the price of the tickets, I was awakened."

The area we were in was rather unfamiliar and there was some question as to where I should turn off this street. Brett was sitting beside me in the car and Doris was in the back seat. As we were driving along, at one point Doris tried to climb over into the front seat, but bumped into me and I was complaining that this was not a very safe thing to do while I was still driving. I believe she remained in the back seat and I turned off on one street, and they both said this was the wrong turn. After driving a short ways, I turned in order to be back on the original street we were driving on, and pointed out a building which was supposed to be a landmark and indicating that I did know where we were. Then it seemed as if the car were parked and Brett and I were walking toward this building just mentioned, and the building seemed to become more clear as a church now. As we walked toward it, we passed a group of 4 or 5 people containing both men and women who were strangers. At first it seemed as if we were rolling rocks toward this church, and then later it seemed as if we were picking rocks up and placing them around the grounds in such a way as to make it more beautiful. At one point as we were near the church, I remember Brett placing a cardboard box upside down and then we placed some rocks on top of this so that the arrangement would have the right height for the surrounding decorations. We walked along the sidewalk toward the church then and the grounds seemed rather unkempt and untidy. Just then church was letting out and large crowds of people were beginning to come through the door, so he and I ran to get ahead of them on the steps so that we could get down to the street."

The instructor, who was a male, had been talking about pre- and post-test results and he had been talking about one particular case which I think was a murder or some other type of criminal protocol.

I had not quite awakened, but I did not seem able to progress any deeper into the trance. The hypnotist was saying something about if I had enough confidence, I could let my eyes roll to the back of my head and this would produce the desired depth of trance. I'm not sure whether the hypnotist was also the instructor or not. Then it seemed as if I was almost awake and the instructor was holding up an ink blot to the class and asking them what factors or what determinants could be used on this particular card. He then asked this question specifically of one girl in class, but she did not reply immediately, and one of the men to her right spoke up and said that you could use color, shading and texture. The card had some purple coloring on it. The class seemed to contain about 20 or 30 adult students. Then it seemed as if a voice were reading a protocol and at the same time an ink blot was in sight, so that the students could know which areas of the card were involved as the voice described different details of the protocol. One thing mentioned was at one part of the card there were two mice that were colored purple, and then there was an explanation of how they came to have this unusual color along with an explanation of how the scoring for each dream was determined."

There was some kind of a problem regarding, I believe it was, my betting into the APA. The older woman was arguing for me. There was also something about a radio playing. Day residue for this dream -- a good number of the elements derived from a short conversation I had with Dr. Hall just before going to sleep. Mainly the APA, the tape -- the tape recorder, and a character who was, I believe, Dr. Hall, in the dream itself. The older woman, I believe, seemed to be Gladys Friedman whom I had written today."

At convention hall in which this nomination takes place I am present and I have some function there, although I don't know what. And it's fairly high up and I kinda know the ins and outs of the place. And one of my friends is a Goldwater supporter. At least he was a friend. And this friend and I become engaged in a conversation minutes before the Senator is due to arrive at the convention hall. And then he arrives, but just before he arrives, I think I said to my friend, \"This will probably be the biggest night of his life and he'll never experience another one bigger. In other words, from then on will be downhill.\" And then the Senator came in with a great deal of fanfare and we began to ascend a flight of stairs. I believe we were in front of the Senator and, seemingly, the fervor of the moment increased the intensity of our discussion. And my friend said to me, \"Do you realize that 50 million people in America are going to vote for Goldwater and that there are 150 million people in the world,\" in Europe I think he meant, \"that support Goldwater?\" And I don't recall my answer to that statement. Then seemingly the argument continued to increase in intensity and we got -- I made some kind of a comment such that Senator Goldwater overheard me, or I knew he was going to overhear me, that's why I made this particular comment, which was unflattering and most uncomplimentary. Then we reached a landing or something and the party of Senator Goldwater passed us -- we stopped on this landing, and we were discussing what would happen in the event -- what Senator Goldwater would do about the Cold War and something was said by my friend, I believe, that he would drop a bomb or two -- turn it into a hot war, very nonchalantly as if there were nothing else in the world that could be done. And I became enraged at this attitude and said to him, \"Do you think that Almighty God, who so dearly loves the little people, is going to continue to oversee their welfare and look out for them and see to it that they are protected and preserved and that they will continue to live just because they so dearly deserve to live?\" And I continued and said, \"Do you really believe that such action would not lead to the total annihilation of the peoples of the earth? Don't you believe that such a thing is possible?\" But my expression was extremely agitated and increasingly higher pitched voice as I became more agitated, to the point where I was almost yelling; I was yelling. And someone ran in from a balcony which was just off to the landing on which we were parking and gave us a look and said something about the fact that we were speaking so loud. And this individual looked like Fred Clark, the actor. It was Fred Clark, I believe, spoke like him and everything. He had on a white dinner jacket and, like Fred Clark, he was bald. Throughout this tirade by me, my friend was standing there with a lame smile on his face as though he were pitying me for holding such a ridiculous attitude. I believe there was more to the dream -- that some of the activities that preceded this scene were preparations for the event. This person who was my friend, is or that is, no, he is a fusion of two people. One of them, a person who is a student at the university -- I've met him on three or four occasions, and the other person is an old high school companion of mine. Nuts. The reason for this fusion is because they remind me of one another. They look alike -- they kinda talk alike. The convention hall is just loaded with people, of course. And as we were ascending the stairs, there were dozens of people in front of us and in back of us. And the Senator, Senator Barry Goldwater, had on a light tan suit. He was very slight of build and I believe he had something in his hands or something around his neck in the way of camera equipment or something of that sort (in leather cases, I believe, small leather cases). These staircases we were ascending was carpeted with an elaborate red, tan, white pattern that was flowery and not too attractive. That is, the stairs were carpeted. They were very wide stairs. It was an iron railing. I believe that all throughout this whole scene, cheering and shouting could be heard from what must have been the convention floor, convention hall floor. Television cameras were covering the event and flashbulbs were going off when he entered the door, though I didn't get a clear picture of this.  The primary elements in this dream were derived from experiences of today. Here again, I was discussing with Dr. Hall, just before going to bed, the occasion of Senator Dirkson's nomination of Barry Goldwater and what a strange thing it was. I also had occasion to mention the convention hall on Miami Beach where myself and two other couples are going this Sunday for a concert. One of the couples consists of the male character if this dream. It was a fusion of two characters. I think his name is Burk Green. He is rather chubby-faced and pleasant. The reason Clark came out was to quiet us down because we were loud ."

            "content": "In this scene there appears a man riding down the middle of a highway. To his right are 2 MG's, convertibles. I beg your pardon, it was to his left. To his right there's another convertible of some kind. In a matter of seconds people sitting in the convertible and MG's handed him some hunting equipment, rifles and telescopes and things and then sped quickly ahead leaving him to throw them into the remaining convertible which he was doing quickly but with some abandon. I'm sitting in the front seat of the convertible with a huge tiger. It was growling at him. The last thing he threw in the front seat, he threw right near the arms of the tiger which was sitting in the driver's seat. It was behaving exactly like a tiger. The person struck me as, for some reason, the name Clyde Beatty seemed to be attachable to him. So as he threw the last piece of equipment into it, the arms of the tiger, he had to lean back against the windshield to where he was only about two inches away from the tiger's growling mouth and waved to the other car to pull ahead. At the signal everything was just fine. The tiger seemingly became enraged by this and sort of swung his paws in an arc and just grazed across the shoulder of the hunter who immediately turned around. The tiger was very ferocious, vicious with a huge cavernous mouth, gigantic. At this point I'm not certain if the scene changed or just the characters changed, but all of a sudden where the growling tiger once was, there was not a big, strong, heavily muscled sailor with a white cap on and blue shirt. Where the hunter formerly was, there was another sailor who seemed to be seated in the back of a tow truck. Someone was driving the tow truck. They were turned around facing the tailgate. The smaller sailor said to the bigger one, \"Roger, you better be careful, your fantasies are beginning to get the best of you.\" But just before the other sailor said this, the sailor who was in the same place as the tiger growled several times as though he were a tiger. I think there is more to the dream, but it seems like this last scene was dreamed 2 times. I somehow seem to feel that there were no changes the second time it was dreamed. Day residue: There are a great number of billboards and magazine ads recently for Esso Oil Co. saying, \"Put a tiger in your tank,\" and they show a huge drawing of a tiger caricature. It strikes me as rather clever and appealing. It shows a tiger in all different places inside the car, on the roof, pushing it, etc. But the tiger in this dream was behaving very realistically, just like you would expect a tiger to. It wasn't manipulating anything. It's just as if it had been placed there. These sailors reminded me of the coast guardsmen at Dinner Key. I don't believe I saw any today. It's not very unusual that I would be admonishing myself for something. In that regard the activity in the dream makes it seem as if the dreamer may be those individuals. In the first part of the dream seated in one of the MG's was a female, blond, not too clear though. They were red and green MG's. I believe it was a model B, MGB. That is they both were Bs. There was barely visible someone driving the tow truck."

            "content": "This is a dream about school. In it I am communicating to a friend about my opinions and evaluations of the University of Miami psychology program. I mention to him that it's filled with weird characters, and as I make that statement, images of Swisher and Allen and others pass in some self-revealing statements or actions. Then I begin to review the nature of the assistantships, and I state that some require a great deal of work, actually an inordinate amount of work and some require almost no work. There's a lot in the middle that are average and they tend to balance one another out, but not on an individual basis. Then an image of one of the assistants, Art Yehle, enters and he's in the process of grading a final examination in an advanced psychology course. He's grading the first section of the examination and he turns to me and says: \"Would you like to see a real wild chase?\" or something like this. He shows me one of the answers of the students which is a complete misinterpretation of the question and 100% wrong. He writes in big letters across the top of the question or answer rather, \"interpreter,\" and by this he means that the student has written down a question on the exam as an answer and it seems that this is fused with an image of the windshield of an old convertible Model T Ford or some such car because the windshield is square and mounted on 2 large supporting rods on either side so that it would swivel. It's not square. Actually it's rectangular and flat. Then all that appears in the upper left-hand corner of the driver's side and written across the window in letters that are a yellow, brown and red plaid is the word \"interpreter.\" It's such that it represents an accusatory statement and accusing the person of cheating actually because implying that the person just looked at somebody else's paper and copied a question rather than the answer in a seemingly frightened attempt to get something down on the paper. Now beneath the word \"interpreter,\" the windshield has a slight break in it. There's a hole in it, as a matter of fact, about 2 inches in diameter over which a small net is scotch taped on. This net is in the shape of, I believe it's called a weather sock, you see on top of airport hangars. It's conical and about 7 inches long, and it has a yellow plaid design on it, not as complex as the other plaid though. At that point the dream seemed to have ended. I got the feeling that Arthur was taking a sadistic glee in having discovered this error or someone's approach to the examination. In regard to the images I had when I mentioned to my friend that the place was filled with weird characters, the image of Swisher also included one of the female graduate students with whom he has been ________ have been having a bizarre relationship. The image of Allen is one in which he is seen from slightly above the waist up. He's complaining or wailing about something. I think it's  a textbook he's justifying as valid for a particular course. At any rate, it's some very inappropriate and super-defensive kind of argument he is putting forth. Then I believe there's a slight impression of Fisher and his whole out-of-touch approach with regard to psychology. At the time which I am talking or with Art Yehle, we are actually in his office in the psych dept. I get the impression that he is Tedeschi's assistant. In regard to the image of the windshield, the weather sock, or the analogous structure that's taped on the windshield is blowing into the car. That is, it's pointed on the inside of the windshield. The word \"interpreter\" is read correctly from the inside also. It's written just above this weather sock at a 45 degree angle. Day residue: I passed Granville Fisher's galleries today in the car and my thoughts became filled with this other kind of activity about Fisher and thoughts of the department and other people. This lasted only about 3 or 4 minutes. I remember reading a couple days ago, yesterday, that the A and P was now giving out plaid stamps in half of their stores for the first time in their history, they were giving out trading stamps as a move against competition. This accounts for the plaid designs. The weather sock, though it looked like a witch's hat, just the top part, and this perhaps is associated with the story I read in Life Magazine in which a witch's hat figures as one of the elements that is on a map and this drawing of the witch's hat supposedly  represents, it's called a _______ which used to be called a sombrero."

The older man is me and the younger woman, I believe, is enamoured of me. The topic of conversation is the Coconut Grove Playhouse with which I was familiar many, many years ago, according to the dream, back in the year of its inception. And the specific topic of conversation is a particular performer at the Coconut Grove Playhouse when I was there. In other words, this dream was taking place, I believe, somewhere in the east and somehow seeming that I have not visited the area in which the Coconut Grove Playhouse is located for many years. And the particular performer at the playhouse was a beautiful young girl who died shortly thereafter under mysterious circumstances. And it was a bit of a sensation at the time because she was quite young and she was also a good performer. It strikes me that the playbill featured her in a bathing suit of some sort and under that was listed her name, and I see this playbill as it appeared in the showcase at the Grove Playhouse. Listed is the girl's name and next to it is her known former chief preoccupation, or occupation, or environment is school in quotation marks. And this particular little tiny piece of information which has her name and the word \"school\" next to it is in gold leaf. Well, the conversation continued and my girl friend that was with me asked me about the death of this girl, and I said I really didn't know anything about it. And she said, \"But your name was implicated at the time.\" And she said that is it true or something like that, that this girl died and shortly after that her father died and then her mother died. And I believe I made some kind of a comment like, \"When they go, they go big.\" And my girl friend said, \"It was such a shame that there was nobody even there afterwards to remember her.\" And I think I repeated the statement I had just made. I believe there was another part to this dream in which I may have been actually somehow involved with the Coconut Grove Playhouse. In regard to the time sequence of this dream, the scene that is taking place in the hotel somewhere in the east, is about 20 to 25 years after the incident that happened at the Coconut Grove Playhouse that is being discussed. And the girl friend that I'm with strikes me as somewhat of a sex kitten type. And I seem to be in my 50's and much heavier. And even though this girl is young enough to be my daughter, I don't really think of her that way. Her interest in this girl who was a performer seems to derive from the notion that she identifies to an extent with her because of her youth. In other words, they were both about the same age when I was involved with them or seemingly involved with them, and they were both attractive. In the word \"school\" that appears under the playbill, there -- the quotation marks are somewhat exaggerated and the one to the left of the word is as it should be, but the one to the right of the word, instead of being place in its proper position, is placed with -- near the bottom of the word rather than near the top. And this set of quotation marks has the tail at the top so that the top of the tail is just about even with the bottom of the letters of the word \"school.\" This is the only unusual feature in the dream. The day residue for this dream: I just saw a picture of a girl in a bathing suit today, that is well known to me. The girl, that is, not the bathing suit. The male, the character, well, me in the dream, the person I was, I seemed to remind me to some extent of my father's uncle who passed away many years ago, but who was a -- he was a bit of a man about town and his years did not seem to impede his sexual prowess or his behavior or the age of the girls with whom he went out at all. And in the dream I kind of felt like him. The feeling that bothers me is that there was about him a slight air of deception."

The first thing I remember is that I'm in small building where everyone is to do something or other. There seems to be no one in particular in charge except for the top sergeant. He has a book of rules and regulations in his hand from which he eventually reads and there's a group of fellows in my room. It seems that later on he picks one out in particular fellows in my room. It seems that later on he picks one out in particular and bawls him out quite severely. In this group there is one new fellow. This is his first time and he's quite impressed by everything. He is commenting to someone else how amazing this sight is to see this chief petty officer chewing out an ensign. This is not the case at all. One of the men is a commissioned officer, they're both non-commissioned officers. He seems fascinated by all these rules and regulations, telling me, and _ of the things he said are not rules and regulations, but just part of the chewing out of being unmilitary or something. Then it seems that the scene switches and it's later in summer camp. They've just come back from some type of duty and again there's e a group walking into my barracks. We're all talking. Somebody mentions the fact that there's someone upstairs who is renting a room. This is somewhat unusual on a military base. It turns out to be a sailor who has gotten a leave or discharge or something and he is unable to leave for one week, so he has to remain there as civilian personnel for a week and rent a room. There was somebody with this guy who was renting the room. Then someone recalls that we had landed at the beginning of summer camp and gone to this peculiar little shack like building, the first thing and we had to laugh about it, how typically disorganized things are. This is supposedly a chief example. There's one character who appears in this dream that I know from school. His name is Clay. He's a rather snobbish, obnoxious sort of person. He just appeared vaguely in the dream. Day residue: I start summer camp in a number of hours actually. This character named Clay is in the naval reserves. I've been speaking quite a lot today about summer camps and how quickly things are always fouled up in the military service."

Her hair is blond, bleached, I believe, and she looks exactly as she does in all her pictures. The feeling upon seeing her as I had predicted was one of slight disappointment and she somehow appeared vitalized because of it. The female that I'm describing is the contemporary jazz singer, Peggy Lee. There were activities that led up this image, but I don't recall them. As I saw her. It appeared to be something akin to an interview in which there was visible a picture of her from about the middle of the bodice up, and she was engaged in conversation with possibly some interviewer. She was smiling warmly and even radiatingly as is often seen in her pictures on record albums and other places."

            "content": "There's a part to this dream I don't recall too clearly. I don't recall it at all now. My memory picks up with two groups of two men, each group consisted of one lawyer and his assistant, and they are awaiting the verdict, I believe, of the judge or the court. And in order to pass the time, they are engaged in a bridge game. It seems to be taking place in what appeared to be a court room. It's empty all but for them. One of the lawyers who is younger than the other. The outcome is that one of them wins, and the one who wins is awarded a certain title in addition to his winning. This title is rather difficult to get because of all the previous groups that have played, 96 of the individuals have received the title that indicates that they are still at a comparatively beginner stage, and there's only 4 who have received title indicating that they are advanced players. Then an image of another person who may be a lawyer occurs in the dream and he is asked, \"Well, how do you pass the time before you receive the verdict?\" He says, \"Being of the Czechoslovakian extraction, I play chess,\" and this is followed by the image of one of his former classmates somehow presenting the picture of him as he was when he was a student. And he comments that he's changed a great deal since then. We used to have a slogan about him, and I believe his last name was Lupke, and this slogan used to be \"Lupke can.\" I then see a newspaper, a school newspaper, that has a picture of him. He's wearing glasses, smiling, and under the picture is an article about him. The title of the article is some sort of a pun which involves this saying they have about him. The pun I don't understand. It consists of 4 words and 2 of them are in a foreign language which I don't understand either, but they are ___ileut _____ ___ileut _____ and it's repeated twice. Then it's followed by the words \"can-can,\" like the French dance. It seems to me that this scene changes completely and my next thought was requesting Dr. Hall to get me a drink of water. This is the 2nd glass of water I've asked Dr. Hall to get me, not the first one. This second glass I'm asking for in the dream, and in order to get this glass of water, Dr. Hall walks out of this room by the outside door and fills the glass at the water spigot on the outside that he uses for watering the grass. I believe it has 4 ice cubes in it, partially melted. I believe in the other part of the dream, where all the characters are involved, that the person's name is Lupke. I think he first name is Hans. The younger lawyer looks like a television character, not a character, but a television celebrity who I think is obnoxious. He's a replacement for Johnny Carson from time to time and he speaks with an affected southern accent. Although he is southern, he pushes the accent. I just don't recall his name. I got the feeling that the person who was keeping the score, one of the players, was from Abseeken, New Jersey, but I'm not certain of that. In regard to Hans Lupke, when he was asked, \"What do you do?\" he answered about playing chess. I believe there was a chess set present in that image. In regard to this newspaper article, I actually saw the newspaper. The glasses that he was wearing had completely round lenses and they were very large, a style that is or was typical of the 20's, but which is coming back in now, especially in sun glasses. Those who were playing bridge, I got the feeling that this is what is ritualistically done at this particular time by all lawyers who are in this situation. Day residue of the dream: The chess set, I believe that derives from an article I read in Life Magazine about the dop experiments in which one of the subjects was able to separate all the chess pieces by color. The bridge game is, I think, associated with a comment Gilda made to me about her mother's maid who is able to play bridge. It was rather surprising to me that she was. I learned this about a day ago, one day ago. Then I saw on television an unusually, an unusual can-can, the choreography was very unusual. I don't think I particularly liked it."

            "content": "This dream takes place in some kind of an unusual building, a castle maybe. I am there with a friend, male friend of mine, and two girls, I believe. The one girl is extremely attractive and very nicely built, and the other girl is also attractive, but not as nicely built. Her hips and buttocks are rather fat; not fat, but almost fat. I believe that in an earlier part of the dream, in various encounters with the more attractive of the two girls--the better built of the two--I believe I had intercourse with her at least once. Then this male friend had seemed to be performing a required and necessary job, such as standing guard duty, some such thing. As we were coming off guard duty, we walked past the girl, the heavy buttocks, and she has on a very skimpy costume such that about 60 percent or more of her buttocks are exposed, and I give them sort of a pat. The friend of mine and I are discussing what's going to happen when we get back to the other girl's chambers. For some reason, we both are aware that she is angry at me. We seemed to be walking across some sort of a roof or possibly through some kind of turret, and as we come upon a staircase that goes down, there's a railing around the top. Up to this point we've been walking very jauntily and discussing this situation very pleasantly, because in spite of the fact that I feel she's mad at me, we both seem very confident that this is a very temporary situation, and our discussions centers around how we can bring this anger to an end as quickly as possible and how we are going to share this girl's favors. So at any rate, as I reach the staircase on top of which there's this metal railing shaped like a circle, except that it's an interior bisection of a circle, I grab hold of this section and do a handstand. As I do it, my pants come down, indicating to myself and my friend that I was getting ready to go to this girl's chambers rather nonchalantly long before I was even there. My friend and I laughed quite a bit at this. Then I come down and we're discussing what is the wisest approach to make. He suggests that we both go down and sleep with her together because she's mad at me and she won't do anything with either one of us, and that she would feel better if we were both there because then she could show how she was angry at both of us. Then the plan was that he was suggesting that after about an hour and a half, I would get up and leave, assuming that she was asleep at this time, in other words, leaving her with him. Then he said, \"You can have her Wednesday and Thursday nights, and I'll have her again on Friday night,\" seemingly indicating that this was taking place on Tuesday. I thought about it and I said, \"No, I don't like that idea. I want her tonight.\" And then I said, \"No, I think that is a pretty good idea after all. I think we will do that.\" We started to go down the stairs and at this point I awoke. The castle or the building must have been on some sort of a hill because as my friend and I were walking across the roof and between various turrets, we could only see the sky. We couldn't see any land around the castle. The girl that was wearing the costume, the costume was black. In spite of the fact that her buttocks were kind of fatty, due to the peculiar stance, I should imagine this girl had lordosis. As my friend and I were discussing how we were going to partake of the other girl's favors, it was accompanied by an image of her in her bedroom with a large bed with a canopy over it, and the room contained a large number of drapes. I envisioned her and her anger at us as a kind of pouty anger. She reminded me of kind of a sex kitten. The friend who I was with is a person I went to high school with, and that I even worked at the same places with for a while. Although he and I never had such an experience, as sharing a girl, we have often discussed our sexual behavior with females with one another, although there wasn't very much to discuss in those days. The girls' costumes and the nature of the girls may be related to a conversation I've had. As I was saying, I had several conversations today about a girl who used to work at the Playboy Club, and this girl was, I would say she bordered on a nymphomaniac, but at any rate there was a great deal of talk about her sexual behavior. Besides, she was previously employed at the Playboy Club as a bunny. The working arrangement that my friend and I had with these girls, although it was rather obvious to everyone, was kept alive only because it was done with some element of coy romanticism."

            "content": "This dream takes place at the University of Miami and the last scene is all I recall. It's about a stage play arranged to be performed by various members of the student body. I have helped in the arrangements of this. I'm also taking part in them as an actor so the night of the production comes the audience is _________. It was ____________ audience and it seems that everything is going fairly well. I'm greeting a lot of people and standing outside of the theater with slacks and a shirt on. I'm completely dressed for my part. I greet many people as I say one of whom is an old friend from up north and we're both very glad to see one another, and I know before I go into the theater, I meet this friend in the theater, that's' right. As we're going into the theater, it's necessary for me to put on a bow tie, which is red. I have my jacket in my hand. I have a copy of the script with me. I get into the lobby to meet this friend. We're conversing and I'm telling him about this, and to walk backstage because I have things to do. So I walk backstage kind of watching the show. This is the first act. The screen or the curtains are arranged in a convex arc so when they're drawn back they come back in both directions. The act is over and apparently the curtains are partially closed during the act, but for some reason they open them all the way even though it reveals all the backstage. My friend and I stood opposite end of the curtain, kind of kneeling down in order to stay out of sight of the audience. The curtains are pulled back so far that we are revealed. A girl I know at the University, Jerry, is in the balcony. She's all the way up front. She sees me and she yells, \"You have heart,\" in the first act or, \"You have part in this.\" I'm shocked because I didn't really think I did. So I get out the script and I look it over, and the audience at this point is applauding because the act is over. Various actors and actresses are bowing and I hear some tears, someone crying, one of the actors or actresses. I immediately assume it's because I missed my cue. Sure enough, I find a couple of short speeches that I should have said and I'm chagrined by this, very upset. So finally the first act ends and the second act begins. Now I know I have part in this act. They were watching very carefully that I pick up my cues properly, but the part isn't for a while. Then all of a sudden Chippy appeared from the side of the stage. It was John Putnam being followed very closely by Don Kirtly. Both of these boys are blind and it looks like Don is chasing John who runs across the back of the stage. I know that Don has had a large part in the production of this play and I'm upset because he appears highly agitated. But his agitation doesn't surprise me because I fully suspect that he could get this way, but I'm upset because he is this way on this occasion. I grab hold of him by the legs. I'm sitting on the edge of something with my legs hanging over and I call him and I say, \"Don, what's the matter?\" As soon as he kneels down to speak with me, I can tell he's very drunk because he has a heavy odor of liquor and he's half in tears and saying something like, \"I'm going to close this play down. They haven't treated me fairly,\" or \"I've been cheated,\" or something like this. He's complaining bitterly about this and being taken advantage of. Just before I grabbed his legs to pull him down, he pulled a large switch which turned off some lights. They weren't supposed to be turned off, but it didn't have too much of a serious effect. He's crying and complaining and I'm trying to give him solace. Several people backstage see this and they kind of smile an indulgent smile and also a smile that seems to say, \"We're glad that you've got him on your hands, not us.\" I recognize this and I dislike this attitude, but I try to ask him what's wrong and he's reiterating these statements. I think he says John let him down. So did a lot of other people. Then he starts becoming very self-defacing. He starts to criticize himself. I realize that if I don't do something, he's going to get worse and worse. I start to tell him not to let these people bother him and Dr. Jones is full of shit, not to be upset by his attitude. It's none of his damn business anyway what Don does in his private life. Don says, \"Yeah, I know, but he's involved anyway.\" Then I say to him I think I know better than he what the consensus of opinion is of Don, what people think of him. I go on to explain to him people think very highly of him. They have respect for his ability and his knowledge and recognize his ability as a student and a person and have great admiration for his courage and dedication. I continue in this vein and this seems to very quickly bring him around. He suddenly stops crying, begins to smile, and then when I'm finished, he says, \"Let me hear it again.\" I kind of laugh and say, \"Well, you know this is true, Don.\" I repeat parts of it. In the meanwhile I had been frantically glancing at my script to try to be certain that I wouldn't miss any more cues and the play has been going on. I get the feeling that I haven't missed anything. There's also a slight feeling of uncertainty and that I might miss them because I just can't seem to get away from Don. I don't want to disappoint all these people again by missing any cues. I get the feeling that this whole thing is going to be very unpleasant if I do miss. The point at which I first encountered Don and stopped him, an image of his wife occurred at this point. She frequently has served as his protector. It seemed to me, I guess, that she was needed now, but somehow she was really incapable of giving Don the kind of understanding that he really needed. I was aware that I was rather reluctant to do it myself. Day residue: I saw Jerry recently in school and had occasion to converse about the Coconut Grove Playhouse momentarily today."

            "content": "This dream takes place in the experimental setting. It's a projection into the immediate future. I find myself in the same room one hour after awakening at which time I'm trying to go to bed __________ of the fact that I intend to go out and stay awake tonight. I'm standing in the door. I had socks and slippers on. I reach over with my one leg and scratch my ankle with my slipper. A whole bunch of what appears like sawdust falls out of the sock, not much, a little bit, two colors, dark brown and yellow, wood colors. Then I bang this thing from which this in which the sock, is yeah, hold it a minute. The same foot from which the sock is that heeled this, I bang it up and down on the ground, more falls out and it becomes live ants and they scurry away in all directions. Then in the purpose of cleaning them up, whatever is left there, I somehow have in my hands a tan plastic dustpan. It has a lot of paper labels on it that I'm taking off. There must be about five or six of them, all places and all over I'm taking them off. While doing this, I hear Dr. Hall and the maid coming down the steps discussing her salary. She's apparently just requested her pay and he says he can't pay her because he doesn't have any money, and he suggests that she be satisfied with being paid twice a week as he has done with her in the past. Then the thought of there being one chicken dinner left in the freezer for Dr. Hall for dinner enters my mind, and then I think of my plans for the evening, which are to go to the Playboy Club. I think to myself that I would like to invite Dr. Hall to join us. Then a very peculiar thought enters my mind and that is, more than a though perhaps, I think it's a conversation. I'm not really sure, with Gilda, and she objects to this idea on the grounds that Dr. Hall is liable to get tipsy and rowdy, and as absurd as I think this is, I think to myself, \"Well, I'm going to be leaving soon anyway; why should I make problems when it's really not necessary?\" So I believe I acquiesce to her demands. I think this is where the dream ended. My thoughts in regard to asking dr. Hall to join us involved a feeling of showing a more personal manner of expressing my liking for Dr. Hall and the many things he has done, and appreciation for the many things he's done for me. It was as if I had said to myself, \"It's about time I do something positive.\" In the dream I was thinking about the Playboy Club, I believe an image of it accompanied the action; even though it did not take place there, this image of it was present, the image of it as it really appears on Biscayne Blvd. For some reason I thought that since Dr. Hall was coming down the stairs with the maid, it was nighttime, and then when I was thinking about going, getting ready to go to bed, thinking later thoughts in the dream, it was daytime. Dr. Hall's attitude toward the maid and their conversation seemed to project a feeling of his wanting to communicate to her, his apologies for not having the money to pay her and at the same time attempting to placate her and feeling somewhat humiliated by not having the money, but at the same time, bothered because he had to do this at all. My feelings when Gilda objected to the plans to take Dr. Hall to the Playboy Club was a feeling of surprise because I would have never anticipated this type of attitude from Gilda. It was one of coldness and disregard for my feelings and somewhat regressive for me in that I actually acquiesced to her wishes which were counter to mine, and mine were quite strong on this matter. The scene that took place with the sock, ants and everything was in completely natural color. The room, my body, the clothes, everything was the same color as it really is. Even though I think I heard Dr. Hall and the maid, but I think that they actually walked thru my room and she left by the door of my room, but somehow I think the room was a little bit bigger so as I was standing there, they kind of passed thru and didn't even notice me. The socks in the earlier part of the dream seemed to be very thick wool socks so that it was not incongruous that this stuff fell out from them. It could have been in there because they were so thick. When I saw these little particles of what appeared to be sawdust turn into ants, I wasn't too shocked, but I thought then they were probably spores or these little egg cases that seem to all break open at once. I'm not sure whether this is part of the dream or not, but I think as I was dictating the dream, I thought one of the electrodes definitely came off, tape and all, but now I just checked them and not a single one of them came off. I was so certain it had. I'm not sure, but perhaps tugging on one of them might have awakened me and maybe I thought that it came off. The notion of going to bed again, just an hour after having run through this, multiple awakenings, seems to be rather strange, like I'm spending all this time in bed sleeping, but then it was kind of countered by seeming to need to get more sleep because of the anticipated late hour I would get to bed after having gone to the Playboy Club. In regard to the part about Gilda's expressing the wish counter to mine, it's a very difficult thing to describe because I don't believe she was here, and yet it seemed as if she was, almost as if she appeared for that short moment to express her counter opinion."

I had jus arisen from a night of multiple awakenings and I believe my father was coming over to visit me specifically because I had just got back recently from Miami. And as he is coming downstairs, or rather as he was walking toward the door on the outside to one of the doors, I leave by another one, but he sees me before he enters. He's with some friends, I believe, one of whom is his wife's daughter. Upon seeing me, she says, \"Is he here again?\" and this she refers to another person only living on the upper floor who is also me. It's as if two of me, both dressed in terry cloth dressing robe. My father and I greet one another and the notion of breakfast is somewhere, but I don't know where, and either he's just had breakfast or we are going to have breakfast or something. At any rate, next scene. I am engaged in a conversation with a large group of people, two of whom are my father's wife's daughter and her other daughter, both are married. I am talking more directly to the one married daughter who's closer to my age, but still I'm about two years older than she is -- three years maybe -- no, about five years. We are engaged in a conversation which is -- just before the dream ended -- had turned into an argument. I was maintaining I was going to become something, and she was maintaining that was not possible. Seemingly as proof, she called her husband out and explained as he stood there like a living example of living ineptitude, how he was incapable of reaching a certain position that he desired because he didn't have the education to do it even though he was a college graduate, and he meekly agreed, with a  slight humble protest. He was dressed in a peculiar sort of an outfit. It looked something like a one-piece playsuit. The trouser part was claim diggers, the upper part was like a shirt -- all one design with a zipper down the front. The design was a dark blue pattern, green and brown mottled sort of effect. She and I were arguing really head to head and there was an underlying tone of bitter sort of a one-upmanship involved. This whole conversation was taking place in what seemed to be a large alcove on the upper floor of this house, and a lot of people were seated on the floor. I think there was a rug on it, as we were seated on the floor, too. It was pretty crowded and I think my father was there watching the whole thing. The husband of this girl at one point seemed like John Clark, but then at another point he didn't. It's hard to say, especially since I've never met her husband. That's not true. I don't remember him too well, but it didn't seem like her husband. It seemed like somebody else."

            "content": "In this dream I play the part of an Air Force hero. I remember that as I'm shot down, I think to myself, \"I have won every single award, but this last one is the wounded astronaut award. Now I will certainly win it because I'm seriously wounded.\" Next scene seems to be I am recovered by the Air Force in an attempt to save my life, but they somehow fail and I'm declared dead. But in truth I'm not dead. I'm _____________ and I appear to be dead. At the graveyard with all military honors I'm being buried. My wife and child are standing slightly down from a small hill on which I am being buried. There is a group of six military men from the different services lowering my casket into the grave. On my casket is like a small window. One of the military men, I think a Marine, shouts to the others that he sees smoke from the window. The window is becoming clouded up. By this he means that I'm still breathing and alive, so they quickly pull the casket back up and someone leans over close to me and listens or something and they discover that I am alive. They call the commander that was right nearby to tell him. An ambulance is brought and I'm rushed to the hospital and they discover that there's only one kind of a piece of equipment that can save me. It's some kind of a huge electronic resuscitator of some kind. This is now night. The only place that has it is right nearby, but it belongs to one of the other military services. It was in a warehouse and they need it immediately. No one can be contacted immediately. It will have to be taken, stolen from them. So a small group of Air Force men, about 6, rides over quickly to the warehouse where it is. Before this happened, however, the commander was informed that I would need some special equipment and at the moment he was informed, he was sitting in his limousine. The person who was informing him was leaning through the window speaking to him. Then he said in response that he didn't understand why that was so because the meat was good enough for them, and by them he meant 2 chimpanzees he had with him that he pointed to, and the man leaning in the window said, \"I'm afraid you don't understand. He needs thus and so.\" I guess he named the piece of equipment or described the seriousness of my illness to him. He said, \"Oh, that's something else.\" Apparently he gave the order to these 6 men to try and steal this piece of equipment. These 6 men pull into the front of the warehouse, the doors of which are all open and the warehouse looked more like a hangar, but it was being used for a warehouse. In front of the warehouse there were 5 men from this other service playing some kind of a game. One of the 5 was a giant. He was about 7 _ or 8 ft. tall and the men looked at one another and said, \"Well never get through them,\" because the 6 of them, the Air Force men, happened to be kind of slightly built. These other men are Army men. They were kind of building a human pyramid of sorts, but not quite. It was less than a human pyramid and they seemed to want to be able to walk in this position that they had gotten themselves into, with one man on the other man's shoulders and those 2 men somehow supported by other men. I forget how. The big giant was helping to get something done. He was lifting one man up and putting him on the other. So they proceeded to walk about 3 or 4 ft. and a couple of the Air Force men walked over. Several of the Army men turned toward them and growled, \"What do you want around here? Don't get near here. You better stay away from here.\" They said this with a great deal of anger and threat in their voices, so that the Air Force men just shrugged their shoulders and walked away. Then more Army men seemed to appear and it seemed as if it were time for a coffee break. They started whistling a tune that they all were sort of marching to, not marching, but they were just kind of keeping step. There must have been 12, 13 or 14 of them. They strung themselves out about 8 long and 2 deep. Right around there in order to keep step there were several that would skip one step to get back in step with the rest. As they were going through the hangar door, some of them were skipping steps just to keep in step with the rest of them. At this point their heads were sort of bend down watching their steps. This was when one of the Air Force men picked up the tune and started whistling it and kind of walked thru another door. They were walking thru a door at a 45 degree angle, thru these huge doors and half the line was in the door and this other guy, this Air Force guy, walked thru the adjoining door and ended up right in front of the line. As he did so, he skipped a step and continued to whistle with his head down so that nobody noticed him. About 2 seconds later 3 or 4 more Air Force men skipped into step in the back of the line whistling and thus they had succeeded in entering the warehouse in order to get this piece of equipment and that's where the dream ended. The commander's or the general's chimpanzees were dressed and they must have been cold because the general himself had a heavy winter blue overcoat on. The chimpanzees I don't know what they had on. One had a white blouse on and as he said the words that the meat is good enough for them, he was looking out across the front of his limousine into the surrounding scene, which was an air field. It was seemingly located near a large body of water which was partially frozen over with big chunks of ice in it. His limousine was also Air Force blue. The main character or hero was me. I felt that at one point in the dream I was somewhat Walter Middy-like. My wife and child or children, I'm not sure, were dressed all in black, and the small mound or tiny hill on top of which I was being buried was covered with very green grass. I'm not sure if I mentioned this, but I had been shot down while in my plane somewhere, apparently in enemy territory or something. I wasn't really very aware of the enemy. The Army men in front of the warehouse, which was all lighted up inside, had T-shirts on and their olive drab pants, pants to their work clothes. The tune that was being whistled was one line of music and it almost sounded like classical music, but it could have been anything. It's very clear, but I don't recognize it. There was an earlier part to this dream concerning my adventures as this Air Force hero of some sort, but I can't seem to remember. Just this week, Tuesday, I was going down to Homestead Air Force Base to make up one day's drill, at which time I noticed that there were a lot of Army men on the base. I asked one of the Air Force men why there were there. He said they were there for the Cuban crisis and they hadn't been moved yet. I was kind of surprised that they were still there. I think just yesterday or the day before the only bachelor astronaut got married and I just read something recently in two different places about chimpanzees. I don't remember what it was, though. I remember while I was at the Air Force base looking at a picture of the commander of one of the sections, thinking how ugly he was."

            "content": "This dream, as I recall it, begins earlier, but I remember it begins at a very elite party, very uppercrust, and for what reason, I have no idea, but I'm there. I believe everyone is dressed in tuxedos and evening gowns, and the instant that I clearly remember began when a most complex piece of design that was decorating the place is some way centrally involved with the activity of the evening, made out of cardboard or silvered (antepaper?) became disarrayed, and I think it was supposed to be my fault or something, but at any rate, I attempted to strike it out. The next thing I remember I was in a hallway and two women were helping me straighten it out, either one was on an end of it and that made them approximately 12 ft. away from one another, and I was underneath trying to straighten this rather complex design. I would sort of crawl on the floor from one to the other, trying to straighten it out because it seemed to be the only way. I became somewhat enamoured with one of the women, even though both of their skirts were rather tight around their knees, the one that I thought was also slightly interested in me, I may have kissed her on the calf and I believe she liked it and sort of presented her other calf to be kissed, which I think I did. Then just out of sheer devilishness, I crept back, fixing the design and kissed the other one on the calf, which didn't go over too big. As a matter of fact, I was quite certain that she was shocked and was possibly indignant about it, but I just chuckled to myself and continued about my work. The rather curvaceous and attractive woman at the other end was moving about and I caressed her legs again and put my hands on and then finally I think I got this complex design straightened out. Then I had taken it in my hands away from the ladies and there were finger holes up and down the center of it, from one end to the other, so that grabbed a certain way, it would open up into a certain kind of a design. I just grabbed and pulled it a certain way, but then the other woman who became indignant at my behavior said, \"I'm going to inform my husband about this, \" and the other woman and I, looking at one another sort of laughingly, and I said to her, mocking the behavior of the indignant woman, \"But c'estime moi?\" and she corrected it and said, \"No, it's not _____, it's (certain moi)\" or something like that. At any rate, she corrected my pronunciation smilingly. It was a rather inviting smile. She was very -- well, they were both projecting a very sensual interest in one another. As we continued to walk down this corridor, we came into a living room, sort of, and this woman was walking back, the indignant one, and the lady who I was with separated from me for a moment, and the indignant woman informed me that she had informed her husband of the unpleasant incident. Well, her husband didn't know me by looking at me. She just informed him of my name and at any rate as I walked by her, I realized her husband was an old man and he was sitting with a rather matronly woman. Now the picture becomes rather complicated. I happened to overhear his conversation with this woman and he is expressing to her that he, in very subtle ways, that he admires her, her attractiveness, and the conversation goes on in this vein. And she asks him, \"What about your wife?\" and he makes some kind of comment, I don't know, something like, \"country widow,\" something like this, somehow implying that she's not with him and she's not anywhere around. She's in the country, or something like this. I think that was the phrase he used, something like golf widow, but he didn't use that phrase. By some deceptive scheme, I had prearranged it so that his wife was there. I don't know where I did this. It's not yet completely clear. It involved a friend of mine, whom I believe I somehow manipulated to appear as myself. A funny thing took place with the conversation of all of us, was in a very British accent. It was almost like a comedy of Shaw, although I dare say my dreams are not quite that good. At any rate, well, this other woman with whom I was rather beginning to become enamoured and interested, I gave her a pat on the rear end and said, \"Now you take this tray of glasses and go in there and offer so and so a drink or something,\" and some way this was a feint, a manner of throwing this man's wife off guard, thinking that somehow things weren't as she thought. It was very complicated. I can't quite figure it out. At any rate, the upshot of the whole thing was that his wife observed him in this rather intimate conversation with the woman he was sitting next to. In other words, the old fat fuddy duddy he was, he was making a play for her and this struck myself and my new-found friend rather amusingly and we both had chuckled to ourselves as the man's wife stomped off in another direction, again rather indignantly. In the earlier part of this dream, there was something taking place in an auditorium, I believe, and it's just that I don't remember too much about the design, but as I say, it was extremely intricate. It was longitudinal and it had at one time been a solid piece of material which had been extremely carefully cut so that it opened into a very complex design, very symmetrical, and as I said, there were these finger holes down the left of it so that by placing one's finger in them, they're labeled which finger went where on the back of it, and how it was to be pulled so that the design came out. At the time it seemed like to get this design back together was a very crucial thing to the affair that was going on. Although in what way, I really am not sure. I had the feeling that self, well, that I was playing a role almost like an actor, and everything was going off according to the cue and the performance was just perfect. The whole dream had a tone of being a very farcical comedy in the old traditions, so to speak, a British comedy, with as I said, sexual overtones. I was just delighted with the whole thing. The old man whose wife I had infuriated was sitting at a very large, dark mahogany table with this woman whom he was making a play for, who was wearing a very low cut evening gown. She was rather fat, though, I won't say, well yes, sort of heavy and so was he. They both were stereotype sort of characters. He a fat old man, rich with a bald head and white hair, and he had a self-delusive quality of __________ as he was making it, so to speak, with this woman. She was something like the grande dame, completely bejeweled. Her rather large breasts were apparent at the top of the evening gown. I don't recall much conversation on her part. I got the impression that she was enjoying the whole thing, whereas the man's wife whose calf I kissed was really an attractive woman, but was somewhat, well, her attitude toward herself was that of an older woman. She dressed in a very severe and what I would say moralistic way, her makeup and her hair drawn back packed tightly into a bun, black dress. The women who I really dug was quite curvaceous and radiated sensual warmth toward me. This friend of mine in the earlier part of the dream was, that is the one that was serving as a dupe for me to get out of this fix I was in with this woman's husband, the one I instructed my new-found friend to go in with this tray of glasses and offer him a drink, that was a tray of cocktails or something and at the same time embraced him so as to indicate seemingly, yes, that's right, that she was completely interested in him and somehow thereby indicating that I was interested in this man's wife, that is the wife whom I had insulted. This was done in such a manner that this woman's husband would observe my friend, my male and female friends. It seems that at one point, before we got into the hallway with this fancy design to be straightened out, it was somehow carried up to the back of the auditorium, that is the entrance to it, the top of one of the aisles was a group of people there trying to straighten it out. And I was more or less trying to straighten it out too, and everyone was yelling at everybody else, \"Here's how to do it. This is the way to do it.\" Everybody was trying to fix it at once. Apparently _____________ it had gotten dragged off into this hallway, I'm not sure how. I keep referring to this thing. It's really not that big and yet it seemingly has changed dimensions a couple of times. It's a very heavy paper like that you would find on milk cartons. The one side of it is silver, a cover with aluminum foil. The edges are scalloped, very small scallops. The nature of the design is reminiscent of the top of the, no, it's like a design I've seen upon occasion in this little window. It's done just the same way. The whole design is made out of one piece of paper, but when you collapse it, you can see by the way it was carefully cut, it can open up into this design. Day residue: This design reminds me of the top of the box of popcorn which the article appeared in its own aluminum box, and all you have to do is put on heat on the stove and it will pop. But the top of it is wrapped in such a way that it forms a design and as it pops, it unfolds and billows out. It's a design sort of thing, and the color is aluminum. The female which I became interested in is somewhat reminiscent of a girl I once knew by name practically, had seen her only once, but who later thorough a series of unusual circumstances, came to be a bunny at the Playboy Club, and she is very curvaceous and attractive, though she is not possessed of the more benign sort of personality that the woman in the dream had. I do plan on going to the Playboy Club this evening, and as a matter of fact, the place in which I intend to go there is the living room. One of the big scenes in this dream took place in what appeared to be a living room, having several levels to it, small levels, 3 steps up to one. The idea of an auditorium might also be associated with the Playboy Club since they have many rooms in which they have entertainment of all sorts and present it in all different ways. One particularly sensual element in the dream, I just remembered, was when these women were holding the design, and I was underneath trying to straighten it out, the woman I liked moved around to the side -- this is after I kissed her on the leg -- and she spread her legs apart, not very far because her skirt was tight, but she knew I was right there. It didn't really strike me at all as a gross gesture. It rather warmed me all the more. One additional bit of day residue is that one occasion Gilda and I, how we did I don't know, but for some reason we started talking to one another in a phony British accent and we were kidding one another with this, and this seemed to come in very big in this dream."

            "content": "This dream takes place in front of this house where I believe Dr. Hall and myself are engaged in a conversation. Then somehow the ex-wife of the Dominican Republic, I think, Mrs. Devalie, is staying here with her present husband. There's an earlier scene to this dream. In this earlier scene Dr. Hall has entered this same room and asked me -- no, I ask him if I have had a dream. I'm not sure about that. We were conversing about something when all of a sudden he became somehow overcome by something -- some unknown attack of, that affected his breathing and he was not exactly gasping for air, but kind of gasping for air, as if he had lost control of his chest muscles. He was smoking a cigarette at the time. And I asked if there was anything I could do for him, and he just handed me the cigarette. And he was kind of partially convulsed in an attempt to recover his breathing at the proper rate, although there wasn't much actual sounds involved. It was like when a person gets the wind knocked out of him. He tried to recover his breath similar to this, except it wasn't so much in the solar plexus as it was in the chest region. Dr. Hall was also in his bathing suit when this took place. He was standing near the window to the left of my bed with his elbows resting on the window sill trying to recover his breath, which he eventually did. Then I guess we went outside. Then is when Mrs. Devalie came out. Oh no, there's another scene. It was before the one with Dr. Hall. I had arisen or somebody had entered the room. It was as if they were the next person to be engaged in multiple awakenings. It was a man and a wife, and his wife was a subject and she was pregnant. She walked off, I guess, in order to be prepared for being a subject. He and I engaged in a conversation, and it was raining outside. He was pointing out to something outside, and the rain was getting very heavy, and the water was getting deeper, and the curbs were becoming flooded. He was pointing to something that was moving in the driveway. It looked like a rock about 7 or 8 inches high. But it turned out to be a turtle. The turtle's head was bigger than its shell, and it had a very rock-like head. It was kind of distorted or uneven. We were both amazed at this unusual looking turtle. It was being harassed by some other small animal. It was trying to turn it over or bit it or something. This all took place during the day. It was all in natural color. The scene with Mrs. Devalie: Dr. Hall and I were playing some sort of game in front, baseball or throwing a ball back and forth. We might have even been cutting the grass, I'm not sure. We were doing something together, and she came out and we began to talk with her -- joking with her about her ex-husband who was dictator -- and I forget how it came out, but she said he had just gotten, she had just visited him recently and he had just gotten a new uniform or a new military uniform, his tan naval uniform. I kind of jokingly said, \"His tan naval uniform\" emphasizing the word \"tan.\" She said, \"Yes, he got tired of his pink one.\" Dr. Hall and I sort of chuckled over this, as did she. I said to her, as she and I walked toward the west end of the sidewalk,  and Dr. Hall stayed at the other end. We were going to get, I think we were playing this game, possibly just playing catch. I said, \"Your husband's activities remind me of the hat game.\" And she said, \"What is that?\" And I said, \"This is sort of a theatrical gag where a person has a whole bunch of different hats -- a cowboy hat, an Army officer's hat, a judge's hat, a priest's hat -- and as he keeps putting them on his head and taking them off, as he does so, he plays the role of this individual for the time that he has it on his head. And she kind of agreed this was a lot like her husband. Likes to play the hat game. In the first scene of this dream the turtle was a very unusual looking turtle and rather distorted, as I said. When this man's pregnant wife came in, I thought to myself, \"Well, we're certainly getting a variety of subjects to run through for dreams. I thought it was a very good idea to have such a variety, especially this one, a pregnant woman. I think I was also glad that I was finished. In the next scene where Dr. Hall was having difficulty in breathing, I was quite upset by his seeming need or his seeming lack of need to get me to do anything for him. Calmed me down somewhat inasmuch as I thought he might have experienced this before, and it was a matter of a passing thing, sort of, but it upset me at first. His bathing suit was blue. Madame Devalie in the last scene is a Negro, or she's Negroid. She was a rather heavy set woman, but jolly and pleasant and charming. By heavy set I mean she was, she weighed about 160 lbs., I guess. She was pretty heavy. She was a big woman, about 5 feet seven. She had on a very long dress that came down to her toes. It was like a shift of some kind. That's where the dream ended, where she, just after she and I had conversed about this hat game. Day residue: I mentioned briefly my brother's wife today. She was pregnant about 12 days ago, at which time she gave birth. I recently read about a turtle in Grapes of Wrath."

            "content": "I dreamed I had awakened and was recording this dream, at which time Dr. Hall walked in and interrupted me. This is in the dream. The dream went like this: something had happened here at the house first; I don't remember what just now. I found myself near Gilda's home and I picked her up and we went out to about a block away from her house on to Ponce and there a parade was about to pass. Also on the corner was a gas station. I became engaged in conversation with the gas station attendants who were fixing a car. This might have been an earlier scene in the dream. I told them I had come down there because I was interested in seeing if I could help them fix somebody's car. It was a very embarrassing situation because they were seemingly capable of doing it, yet I had met the boy who owned this car earlier somewhere, and explained to her that I wouldn't mind helping her because she was complaining that these guys couldn't fix it. So therefore I represented myself or presented myself in a rather difficult situation. They were rather mocking of me and they said, \"Just what do you want to do? What do you expect to do here? Do you expect to get a salary?\" And I said, \"No, I just thought I'd come down and see what they were doing, and see if I could make any suggestions or anything.\" I had brought something with me, I don't know what, in order to help. It wasn't a tool. I'm not certain just what it was. At any rate, after a while we became friendly and then later on I was near the same spot with Gilda and we were watching this parade that was about to pass. There was a small crowd of people around us. I was conversing with Gilda about the parade and it seemed that Mayor Robert King High was going to be in the parade. It was some kind of a fantasy sort of parade in that they had decorated floats with some kind of a theme. We were kind of laughing about the fact that Mayor High or somebody didn't want something in the parade. It seemed rather silly because it offended him and it was rather funny to us that this would offend him. At this point one of the fellows from the gas station came up to greet me and say hello and we talked a while about something. Then the next scene was I was in bed here recording this dream and as I was recording the dream or just before I was recording the dream, I looked at my watch and it said 10:20, whereas at this very time it says quarter of ten. As I was recording the dream, I heard Dr. Van de Castle and his family pull up outside, and I heard several of his children get out of the VW. I continued to record the dream, and one of them came in the door in the middle room here and then looked in this room, the door of which was open, and I heard one of his older brothers call to him from outside, \"Don't close the door,\" meaning this door, and implying that he should stop staring or listening and just close the door, which I believe he did. And then Dr. Hall came in and said, \"Oh, I see you have a dream.\" I said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"But if you don't mind, I'd like to go over it because I'm afraid I'll forget it.\" And I continued on dictating the dream. Then the door opened and two adults walked through. Seemingly I had met the one before in the dream, and he looked exactly like Dr. Karner at the reading clinic. He was being shown through the Dream Institute. This was like a live demonstration, sort of. At this point I woke up and realized to my surprise that I hadn't at all been recording the dream as I thought I had. Day residue for this dream: I was in a gas station a good deal of the day yesterday getting my car fixed. There was another part to this dream. In this earlier part of the dream, in this other part of the dream, I remember saying the following, I believe: \"I'm going to shoot you with my gun except it isn't long enough,\" so I had to get this pistol to do it with, but to whom this was addressed, I don't know. The feeling surrounding this was one of anger at someone for having done something, I just don't know what. In trying to think of further day residue, an image came to me from another dream. It was not this dream. I don't know which dream it was, but I believe it might have been the 4th dream, and this image was only a small part of the dream, but it was myself again recording a dream. It became impossible because the tape on the tape recorder continued to tear and shred, and as a matter of fact, I played back a part of it to try to recapture what I had said so I could make sense of it. It would play back the little bit that it had recorded as you might expect a tape that is torn in place to play back. You'd hear a voice and then it would stop. Then you'd hear a scratching, rumbling noise, then you'd hear the voice again, then you'd near nothing, then you'd hear the voice again. Well, I guess until the tape finally -- it finally just tore apart. It was shredded and torn in many, many places. It was brown in color. The time I stated in this dream, which I stated was the actual time, was incorrect. I now look at my watch and find that it is 1 minute after ten, so from deducting the amount of time that this dream took, which I am not sure, it must have been about -- that is recording the dream took about six minutes, so when I woke up to actually record the dream, it would be somewhere around 10 minutes of 10."

This was pretty interesting. I wanted to know how fast he could come straight down and stop before crashing to the ground. He could come down pretty fast and stop. We looked real close at the river, and he seemed to have a sand bag on which he had his thing on because the girl who was with him walked out on the blanket, and it didn't sink in the river. It was probably right across a sand bar. Hall: They were on a picnic, and they weren't in cars, but they were walking. Sam didn't recognize any of the other people he was with except for Eddie.

I was back looking at the wines, and they had some wines from Spain. They were sauternes in silver paper and gold paper covered bottles. They had some real old wines there. I could read the labels -- 1917. The bottles were various shapes and sizes, some being tall and square and others just being squat and fat. Then I went over where they had this display counter with these little figurines and carving from Japan that were for sale. They were quite commercial. There was nothing worthwhile. But I looked at them for a while anyway -- wooden bowls and stuff. They were machine cut and they were not very good. That was all the dream.

I think our boat was a used boat, but it was pretty good at the price we paid for it. We passed some other boats. The only boats that passed us were bigger and more expensive boats. We is myself, my wife and my mother. We beached the boat. We had a picnic, and we discussed the merits of the various boats. We decided that ours was a good one for the money and we were quite happy with our boat. My wife and my mother purchased the boat, and they told me that they had looked at some that were cheaper. I think the price was 9.95, a used boat and a new one was more expensive, something like 22.95. But the one they had, I think, was about 12.95. Anyway, I liked the boat. I was quite satisfied with the boat. When we left the dock area, we drove the boat out the channel between two pieces of land. They seemed to have rather, you know, stone sea walls. There were high trees along the water edge, and this channel wasn't straight out to the ocean. It went at right angles kind of out. When we got back, I got in an argument with a man over the merits of an Evinrude over a Johnson. I was all for the new Johnson with an inboard and outboard drive. He thought just the outboard alone was pretty hot stuff. These canals were actually quite long. This canal was a continuous canal with a lot of turns and much of the time I recall was spent driving the boat down these canals. The boat was an open boat, somewhere between 16 and 18 feet, I would say, and it had one of those inboard-outboard drives. You could tell this because it had a box in the back rather than an outboard motor hanging out."

I was waiting there and she was trying to get her parents to let her go out, but they didn't want her to go out. While I was waiting in the house, I was looking at this collection of what looked like gold pieces and jewelry that one of her, apparently her sister or cousin, had gotten, and they seemed to be copies of her engagement ring and marriage ring and jewelry her husband had bought her. Karen didn't have any of these things. Her parents didn't want her to go out, but she finally got permission to leave and we left. As we got in the street, we saw an old buddy that had been in the Army, and I hadn't seen him for a long time, so we stopped into see him. He was having a party, the kind of thing where there was lobster and stuff to eat. The most outstanding thing was that he had grown so much. Before he went in the Army he was just a little guy. Now he was a great big guy when he came back. The jewelry collection was a collection of miniatures, small pieces that one of her relatives had gotten. The idea behind it was like, \"See how good this girl cousin of yours is compared to you because you don't have any of this. You just go out and screw around and you don't get anything for it.\" When her parents finally relented and we left, we went by my buddy's house and I saw that he was back from the Army. We ran in and he saw me and recognized me. We ran up to each other and embraced each other. I could tell he was wearing his, no, he was in civilian clothes, but I knew the sergeant so I said, \"Hi, sergeant, how you doing?\" He was much bigger than before he left. He had grown in stature completely. He was my size now. Before he had just been a little guy. I thought he was through with the Army and had come out for good, but he wasn't. He was just on leave and he was going back in. It was a small dinner party, and I recognized his mother and there was another of his friends there, but I can't remember. I'm not sure. I think it was Francisco, but I'm not sure. While I was at Karen's house and she kept imploring her parents to go out, I had kind of an embarrassed feeling. I really didn't want to be there waiting for her to get out of the house. When we got into the party _____ insisted that I have something to eat. They were having what looked like rice and lobster, but it was obviously a planned dinner party for so many people. I said no, I wasn't hungry. He finally got me to eat some dill pickles from a condiment tray that was there. That was the end of the dream. The reason that I picked up Karen is that we were, I had planned anyway, I don't know how willing she would have been, to get the car, go out and park the car and have intercourse with her. That was the whole effort behind the thing. Day residue:  There was one little item in the miniature jewelry, there was a little round charm of carved gold, gold round charm carved with a design that I remembered from my wife's charm bracelet. In this miniature was also a bracelet. Then about a week ago an old friend came over and we discussed my buddy's coming back from the Army in March."

Somebody, they were giving away a scholarship, and the terms they were kind of like they had this, what do they call those, pasteboards; mortar boards, not pasteboards. This instructor took this mortar board and threw it out into the crowd and whoever grabbed it got the scholarship. I wasn't particularly interested in the scholarship, I was just going to watch from the roof. He threw it out and one of the two Negroes caught the mortar board. It wasn't the one I was friends with. It was another one. It was alright. Then we were sitting down kind of out in the open as a class. We were getting some sort of lecture. I was sitting away from the class. One of my teachers came over and looked at my notebook and wanted to know why I was sitting way over here. My notebook had notes in it, so I was taking notes, and apparently the lecture was pretty boring, and the larger group was restless. And he said to the larger group if anybody's nervous about not getting a seat inside, which was some distance away, \"I'll make Bedell here promise not to use his motorcycle.\" One of the students was there and he looked at me like, \"Do you promise?\" I looked at him. It was an old student I hadn't seen for a long time, one that was in my class four or five years ago. It was Liz Winston; I recognized her. And I said, \"Yes, I promise.\" That's about all. Hall speaking: The two Negroes were both males. He didn't recognize the Negroes. The instructor was a male. Sam: The boy I recognized, this Les Winston, was wearing a yellow sweater, and also while we were sitting in a group, the colored boy that didn't get the scholarship was, he almost was Caucasian in his looks. He was colored, but in pigment. When the other boy caught the hat, we were settling down as a class. The person who had thrown out the hat, the instructor, said that, \"Well, that's good. I'm sure you're relaxed.\" And the boy who caught it said, \"Yes, I'm very happy, very pleased.\" And the instructor said, \"Well, that settles one of our problems anyway.\" Then we sat down. The other colored guy said then, \"Yeah, that settles Martha's problem then too,\" and this was a dig at me. This was a dig at me because Martha's in our class too and Martha is in one of my lab groups. I've taken Martha out to lunch or something and it's probably a guilt, you know, against my wife. That was the basis of the dig. Hall: If Sam promised not to use his motorcycle, then class would be seated and they would get an equal chance to get a front row seat, which is a desirable place to sit, and everyone wants to sit in the front rows. The boy in the yellow sweater is not in medical school with Sam, but is someone who was doing pre-medical work with Sam about a year or so ago. The boy's name is Winston, the one that is in the yellow sweater and that Sam used to know. The Negro boy that made the remark to Sam who said, \"So is Martha relaxed,\" Same considered this a dig, but he just, that is, Sam just winked back at the Negro boy. He didn't feel particularly upset by this ______. The wink was covering a little twinge of conscience on the part of Sam because of his taking Martha out to lunch and so forth. The instructor was not recognized."

            "content": "This version of the dream was transcribed by Al on the tape-recorder the next day. The first record of the dream began early in the evening, sometime around mealtime. I had no definite plans for the night and I ended up by getting dressed and going somewhere that I can't identify where I went, but somewhere during the course of the evening even though I didn't have a date. I acquired one in some fashion or another and had a very good time. And after the date I recalled that I stopped off to see some friends or something to round out the evening very well. Anyway, as it ended up, I was in very good spirits on my way home, having had what I considered to be a very pleasant evening. The scene shifts then to me parked at the curb outside of the fraternity house where apparently I was living and it was raining very hard. And as I opened the door of the car which was a long, sleek black Dodge, a car which I despise. A girl came walking past the car, a girl whom I cannot identify specifically, but who seemed very familiar and she stood outside the car, and the door was open and I had my legs outside the car. And she was laughing and hollering because she was getting soaking wet. And she told me to hurry up so we could go into the house together and apparently this was a co-ed house or something where men and women were living, which is very strange because it was supposed to be a fraternity house. Nonetheless, I thought nothing of it at the time, and I was sitting there collecting things off the dashboard, cigarettes, lighter, small change and things--in other words, not jumping right out the car and dashing into the house as one would expect in heavy rain. And this is why she was laughing and hollering so much--it was so funny--she was just standing there getting drenched and we both thought it was very hilarious. Finally, we did go into the house and the scene ended. It picked up again --it may have been later of the next day or it may have been the following weekend whatever I was then with this other girl--the girl who had passed by the car whom I had run into the house with and apparently I had seen her previous to the time I had gone out or the week before when I had acquired this unknown date when I had such a very good time and apparently I had told her something to the effect that I didn't know what I was going to do and so forth, so as the evening began, she was reprimanding me in a mild, kidding, almost patronizing, paternal sort of way about the fact that poor little I had gone out and had a very bad time with the boys or riding about town worthlessly and that I shouldn't do these things. I couldn't seem to convince her that the fact was I hadn't had a miserable time as she was inferring. I really had a very pleasant time. I had spent a wholesome evening with a wholesome girl and enjoyed myself rather than being out shooting pool or something. It wasn't a very clear conversation but that was the gist of it--a reprimand. Then the scene shifts again. This is strange--as we were starting out--the reprimand took place while we were driving and it seemed that we were starting out from the fraternity house where we were both living and when the scene shifted we were back at the fraternity house, entering the front door and we were very dressed up in formal attire, apparently in our way into a dance because there was music coming from the ballroom off to the left and an air of festivity throughout the place, in the lobby as I--a smile on the hat-check man and so forth--this is the point where Gary awakened me but there's a great deal of description beyond this. I never at any time during the dream had an image of the two girls who played a part in the dream. I could feel their presence. I knew that they were there--I could sense what kind of girls they were, but I could not actually see an image of a face before me. Even so I knew what the second girl looked like. I could tell that she was tall and slender, and I could tell that I was not attracted to her in any physical or sexual sense--that rather I felt a very close comradeship. I liked this girl very much as a friend. I didn't seem to feel any sisterly attraction to her as I mentioned to Gary last night, but it could have been, but the only two people with whom I've had such a cordial, kidding relationship that I can think of--that is, girls--was last year--and one of them may have fit the description of the girl in this dream. She was sort of a clown. She is the only one I could identify the character in the dream with. However, I didn't see her face, so I don't know. As for the first girl, she was my conception of extremely attractive, even though I didn't see her face, I knew how she was built. She was small, that is, in the vicinity of 5'4\"--very well built--a cute, pretty, wholesome appearance. All this I sensed. I never really saw any of it. The other strange thing was this fraternity house as I stood in the lobby wondering whether I should check this girl's coat, really didn't have the appearance of a fraternity house, but rather had the appearance of an officer's club. The only thing strange was that it appeared to be like the Officer's Club at the Washington Heights military base in Tokyo where I had gone frequently years ago to attend different social functions, a place of which I have pleasant memories. It was not like a college place, but had a sophisticated flavor to the whole thing. The only color I can recall--most of it was combination of black, white and grays, but there was one place--a lot of dim colors just as we entered the fraternity house--the place (the lobby) was lighted like a night club--blue-black appearance coming from the ballroom -- rather yellowish lights--lobby colorfully decorated--cannot conjure up any specific colors. As I sat outside the fraternity house in the car, it reminded me of the time when I sat outside the teenage club and kidded with the people--light-hearted, gay, banter--very pleasant dream--pleasant social interactions. This version varies in only two substantive ways from the dream as reported on awakening. First, Thor had had a date with the first girl, he had gone to pick her up and she was not ready, so he had gone to visit and have some drinks with friends (mixed sex). Second, the man at the hat-check counter was looking sour rather than smiling."

Then the scene shifts to outdoors--very much like woods at first. For some reason we are in a very old car (black) backing up across a road and into the woods. We are both wearing pajamas  and are intending to sleep in the car alongside the road running through the woods. It is very dark and I can't see a thing, and because I am not sleepy, I am restless. The scene shifts again and I am alone in the car driving toward someone' s house. The scene shifts again and I am sitting on a huge rippling terrace of the Alice in Wonderland variety. There are two girls--twins--about 16 years old sitting in white iron lawn chairs on either side of me and an older woman, apparently their mother, in front of me sewing. I am staring at one girl because she appears to be daydreaming and while so doing, I begin to dream myself. It has been broad daylight since I arrived here, yet I am dreaming a nocturnal sort of dream--awake, staring and sitting up. I can dimly hear a conversation going on between the other girl and her mother. I begin \"waking up\" and looking back and forth from the daydreaming girl to her sister and mother. The girl who was talking to her mother is now laying down on her back toying with a flower or something. A conversation ensues where I am saying, \"I once wondered if one could dream both in the past and present tenses at the same time, and now I know,\" or some such thing. I don't remember the comments after this, but it was snide and had a tang of ridicule on the part of the reclining girl and her mother. The other girl is still daydreaming. I don't know why, but I feel a liking for the dreaming girl, and a resentment for the other 2 characters. They seem like Cinderella, an ugly stepsister, and a mean stepmother. Neither girl is pretty and I am not attracted to them. In fact, I feel a paternal attitude. The scene shifts and I am back in the old car with the man--he is driving and it is backwards again on the same road. He passes the place where we were parked before, and so he pulls forward to the place. I light a cigarette with the old-fashioned car lighter and there is some confusion about getting the lighter back in the socket. Then we are walking down a river or canal and it is no longer a woods, but a jungle. Then we are at a grassy clearing alongside the river and the man is sleeping on some sort of elevated platform with me standing beside it looking into the river. I see (the moon is very bright and golden) in the water a huge clump of black snakes are swimming and become frightened and climb up on the platform where the man is asleep. Then the water becomes mired with hideous creatures flashing their teeth up at me. The grass in the clearing is suddenly teeming with creatures below me and I am too afraid to sleep. I see a snake slither through the grass, and then a pack of bright green rats. Then there is a pack of black and white tarantulas (or some such spider) just below. They are enormous for insects and I throw something at them, trying to disband them. When I hit one, it became angry and jumped up on the platform in the dark. At this point I was beside myself with horror and bolted upright in my bed--turning on the light and feeling frantically for a spider until I had fully awakened.  The next dream that I had and the longest, most involved, concerned myself at my parent's home somewhere. The dream began as I was, it was late at night and I was asleep and I woke just in time to see my little sister, my younger sister, who is approximately 15, sneaking her boyfriend thru my window and across my room, headed toward another part of the house. I called to her as the door opened, \"Diane,\" and she started to reopen the door and asked me what I wanted, but she knew what I wanted, so she changed her mind and went ahead and closed the door again because she didn't want to hear. I jumped out of bed and followed. I only recall getting to the other side of the house and looking out the window and seeing this boy headed off in the far blue yonder in his old beat up car. My sister never did reappear in the dream. What I did was to run outside and hop in my car, which was new, and began to chase this boy because I didn't like him, and I resented his being in the house and taking advantage of my sister. There is no indication and I never have considered that he was taking advantage of her in any sexual sense, rather he was taking advantage of her gullible personality, but she liked him and he wasn't worthy of such affection. For this reason I was tracking him down and I was chasing him the car. Somehow or another, he had an arrogant attitude about the whole thing. I could see his face as he drove, and it was as if he was pulling something over on me. Somehow the situation became reversed and he ended up chasing me, his car right behind mine. We were going down dark, narrow streets, very, very fast, just as fast as we could go--90 to 100 miles per hour, I assume. My dog was in the car with me. Great big dogs were running around chasing the wheels, large German Shepherds and collies and big mean boxers and everything were jumping up on to my car, trying to get to my dog and my dog was just barking at them and sort of coaxing them on. The size of these dogs was very exaggerated and they were leaping back and forth over the car like antelope and it was real frightening. Even though it was frightening in this way, I wasn't afraid. I was just angry that this guy was now on my tail and I recall as we sped along, we started to come up very rapidly in front of us, just someone who drove along, poking along. I tried to slow down and I slammed on my brakes. I could see in my rear view mirror that he was very tickled, very amused because he felt he had me under his finger. Even though I was chasing him, he knew that he had me, so to speak, over a barrel. I was becoming increasingly annoyed with this. As I slammed on my brakes, I barreled right into the rear end of this other man, broke the windshield and smashed up the front of my new car. I could see that he didn't care if he hit me, even though he had plenty of time not to. He or it didn't matter. He purposely slammed right into the back of me at which time I went into a most furious rage, which I think is the last I can remember. I think I woke up."

I think I can identify these girls as the 2 girls we saw last night, Janet and Ellen, but I couldn't be certain of that, but I would think so as I remember it. Anyway, the air of the whole affair seemed to be very gay and efficient, but light, cheerful. After I woke, I was sitting in front of the bar by the kitchen. Gary was behind the bar. I began arguing with one of the girls over the cake. I had baked a banana cake and she had baked a fudge cake. I don't know when, but they were both around, and I was sampling a piece of each. The argument came up about who baked the better cake. She insisted that she did. Of course, I knew better. She said the reason that my cake wasn't as good as hers was because I didn't use any lard in it. I insisted that I could make it better with oleo margarine. It was really silly because I don't think you use lard in cakes anyway, at least who would want to eat it. Even though we were arguing over this thing, I didn't get angry really because she was rubbing my back throughout the whole discussion rather good-naturedly. I was very pleased with this. Then she leaned over and kissed me on the back and I woke up. Where this idea of lard came into my mind, I can only think of that when we were at the grocery store yesterday, I happened to notice a very large jar of white material which I didn't know what it was, and I went over and looked at it and it was lard. I found it rather curious because this was something I never had occasion to use. It just caught my eye, so perhaps that's where the thought came from. That was all of it. Just a brief note. There was some color in the dream. The color of the cakes, chocolate-colored cake, and the banana cake was white."

I don't know why I was there. Something proceeded my going in there. Some sort of a story, but I don't know what it was. I can only remember the scene of my being in there and little holes in the floor, four set in a square as on 4 corners of a box. Candles were inserted into these holes, and I had been instructed by someone to light these candles. In the scene was I there lighting these candles. I know that this wasn't a religious celebration of any kind, but rather I was told to do this to keep the animals away. It was some such idea. There was color in this dream. A good deal of it came with the yellow light. I could distinguish the color of the walls, the color of the candles, the color of the light of the candles coming from the candles. I can't identify any emotion or there were no other characters that I can recall, but this one scene which occurred sometime during the night."

I don't know exactly what the subject was or what the views were, but only that such a relationship existed in the dream. We pull up in front of the restaurant as one would a hotel, and the doors were open. I stepped out. This was something like some kind of gangland operation. I proceeded the girl as I was walking into the restaurant. I was laughing about something that she had said. She too was laughing and was in the middle of a word when she broke out with a sort of strangling \"eck\" sound. I turned around and there was a young man, in his twenties, with his one arm around her neck choking her. I turned to him very angrily and moved toward him threateningly and he disappeared just as though into a puff. I stood there in that same spot for about 15 minutes waiting for him to come back because I was going to beat him up."

Two of them seemed to be the principal characters. One was large and fat, the other one looked like me. It was me. The setting seemed to have been an open field, surrounded by woods, and the action began with some sort of treachery underfoot, whereupon some commodity or sort of goods that were in the fields were being stolen by a faction of our gang. Apparently the fat man was the head, top dog, and I was apparently the second dog, and our gang was split into factions where some followed this fat man, and some followed me. The impression I got was that we were in competition with one another, that is to say, he and I and the two gangs--one gang really but two factions of the same gang. Somehow--the action is not too clear here, but the scene shifts, so that now the fat man is in the field and we are talking , and the goods are gone, and apparently his faction has got them. I think it's narcotics. Anyway, we're talking and he has engineered the whole plot and I'm very distraught about the whole thing. And he's being very understanding, and we're trying to figure out together who's behind the theft. We can't figure it out. The story shifts to where now I'm talking to him over the telephone at an airport. I'm about to leave for Italy. Very appropriate. I'm telling him--I can see us both talking on the phone at the same time--like he on one end and a stretch of distance in the middle and I on the other end. He's telling me that he's going to do something, some dire deed that I don't want him to do, and I'm pleading with him not to do it, that I'll get the goods back somehow and I'm promising that I'm going to have these goods back--all the while he's just smiling. Of course, I can't see this--he sounds on the phone like he's dead serious, but I can see it in the dream that he's smiling while he's talking to this other gangster, which is me, because he's pulled a slicky and apparently by one means or another he had a plan figured out whereby he's going to collect for the stolen goods twice and I'm not in on it. Anyway just to appease me, he says, \"Okay, he'll give me another chance to retrieve these goods while I'm in Italy,\" knowing all the while that I couldn't and then we didn't hang up or anything and the scene shifted again to where I'm now in some dark, dingy crumby little place. It would be logical to say this was in Italy, but there was nothing around to distinguish it from any place else. I was just someplace, either squatting on a chair or squatting on the floor in the process of cutting a large barrel of heroin, I guess. Anyway, I was cutting it with something, I was mixing it, and I was funneling it into little capsules like you see in the movies, putting this stuff together for marketing."

And after this the scene showed the bubble gum machine had become mine. I was being congratulated. I was proud, and I was inquiring to someone how one went about getting the little balls out of the glass jar so that they could play with them. This had something to do with my pondering the idea of how does one reach the child if one can't take its thoughts or something out and play with them or something like this.

This happened several times and I was laughing like mad. There was fruit and stuff all over the floor. I recall one guy cleaning it up. I remember thinking how disgusting the mess of food was, you know. I would probably get sick if I had to put my hands in it and clean it up. He cleaned it up and took all this food unspoiled except it was messed up back into the kitchen and threw it in a trash can and this is when I was salvaging those steak scraps out of the can."

            "content": "My first recollection of this dream picks up somewhere along a highway and I'm riding in a car with my family. It's an old car, a very old car, about a '53 Pontiac. The paint is very dull and I think it was the typical Pontiac green color. Anyway, it was rainy and drizzly. We were riding in the car and passing a woman hitchhiking on the highway, and I thought this was very unusual. A few hundred yards beyond there for some reason or another, something went wrong with the car. My father was driving and pulled the car over. This woman was just down the road. We all got out of the car and fooled around, looking at a tire or something. A few words passed between my mother and I, but I don't know exactly what they were. Somehow we were back in the car about to leave, as we hadn't left. As we got back in the car, oh now I remember. While we were sitting there, we invited the woman, I should call her girl from down the road, to sit in the car and stay warm. It was drizzly. As we were climbing back into the car, the back seat, I believe, we were saying to her that we were going the other way and she was saying, \"Oh no.\" So we made her get out, but before doing so, arrangements were made, somehow or another, to meet her again somehow. Next thing I recall was driving into Washington, D.C. I remember looking around and I even remember the view as I came in the White House was on my left. As we came past the White House, the Capitol began to show right behind it. Right in front of me as we were going down the street was the Washington Monument. Of course, the city is not set up this way, but anyway this is the way it was in the dream, and I remember remarking over and over, \"God, the White House is filthy dirty. It's not white.\" We continued and stopped the car somewhere around there for some reason that I can discern. We're out marching in front of the White House, either the White House or the Capitol, and it was my father and I and we were going to do some work on a couple of marble slabs out in the terrace of the White House or something like that. I remember as we were standing around discussing it, he handed me the car keys and told me to go back and get our tools because we had forgotten them. I got awfully mad about this and told him, \"Why should I go do it while you're just standing around here?\" The whole time while I was saying this, I was thinking about this girl who had something to do with it, but I don't understand what. At this point it becomes pretty hazy. I don't recall exactly what transpired between now and the next scene, but at the next scene we seem to be driving into what seems rather familiar. It seems like Miami. It seems like the surroundings of Miami, yet we're all calling it California. It looked like Miami to me, but anyway it was supposed to be Calif. And we had already made prearrangements to pick up this girl. By a bridge on the way into town. She was there. She got in the car and she had the appearance of being a conglomeration of several girls that I've known in the past. She looked like all of them. Whichever one it was primarily, I found her extremely attractive and I was in love with this girl, but it never came to that. This was the feeling though. This was the emotion I felt in the dream. From here there was some chatter about finding her a job and a place to live, something because my parents were responsible for her. I don't know why they were responsible, but somehow she was in their custody. The girl was dropped off and told to go look for some place. She didn't want to, but she was told anyway to go ahead and we all would be back later to get her. Then we'd all spend the day together or something like that. It was only a matter of a couple of hours and we were back. She was supposed to have found a job and a place to live and all that. I don't know where we were. Sitting in a restaurant, all of us. My father was perpetuating some sort of fraud with someone because I remember him saying to someone that the place she found to live was a specific address. Then the last thing I remember seeing was a newspaper lying across the table with this address written across the front page in headlines. The headline was that this girl had found an apt. I remember thinking just before I woke up that this was a lie. This wasn't true. He was lying that this girl was living at this address because I knew differently. This was just an address of some property that my father had owned or rented or had some association with, but was gone now. He sold it. I knew this official was questioning him where the girl was staying, and I knew he was lying. This is at the point where I woke up, I think."

I would assume that it was Whiteman, I mean Homestead Air Force Base, and I picked up a service man. He was a sergeant that was colored, and he indicated to me that he wanted to go to the Ale House. I could see myself coming through the gate, and he was standing. He had already passed through the gate and was standing not alongside the road like a hitchhiker normally would, but standing right in the very middle of the road, just standing there. I recall his waving his hands over his head to halt me down. He was very pleased that he got the ride. It was dark, really dark, not like early evening, but more like the middle of the night sometime, that dark. And I can remember that the Air Force uniforms were exceptionally brilliant as far as the blue was concerned, even though it was very dark. The blue shown much more brilliantly than it is in actual life. That's it."
