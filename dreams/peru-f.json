The house in which we lived was very large with a lot of glass and big rooms with electrical appliances. One day I decided that I would try all those experiments he did on me, on him, to see their results. The results were that we both finished up for good, locked in rooms (separate) so that the doctors would cure us. But the strangest thing about the dream was that I wasn't dreaming this, but rather my sister was telling this story about one of her patients to me. When she finished her story, I met her and she told me that both of the sick people would stay until they were cured."

So we opened a box and put many straws in for her to take. All of this took place in the school I attended until I was 11, but it was in the recreation room of the older girls."

Then I told my father that the tide was rising and it was best to leave, so we started to climb, but in order to go up we had to climb some stairs which were very tall and narrow and they were made of tiles and slippery. I remember that at the beginning I was helping my father and when he reached the top, I was left all alone and couldn't go up, and I asked him for help and he wouldn't help me. When I got to the top some people started to get there who said they were going to play golf and that this was the private beach of a club. I went up and walked to a very small white house that belonged to an aunt of mine. There, in that house, I met two girlfriends who told me that we should go to Ancon. They looked very pretty and when I looked in the mirror, I looked terrible and all my clothes were very dirty and I told them that I couldn't go like that, and they said it didn't matter."

We met my aunts and they told my sister to take me to the hospital, because it might be harmful for me to be around. Before that I asked the boy to take me to a bookstore to buy a pen for a girlfriend. The salesman showed me how the pen worked in the store. I bought it and asked to have it gift-wrapped."

In class we were talking to the teacher (I do know her and she teaches me Family Education, she is about 38) and I recognized several classmates. We were talking about dresses, materials and patterns, since we wanted to make them. I described a dress in a white material, with a zipper in the front and  a collar, sleeveless and with colored pockets. I said it was a dress for the beach.

I don't know what the motive was. Tela wanted to scratch her stomach in front of Tony, and when I saw this, I scolded her. She reacted furiously and told me that why couldn't she do what she pleased. To show me how daring and independent she was, she took off her panties and stood half-naked in front of Tony and me. Then I reacted violently also and, wishing to punish her, I also took off my panties to hit her with them. This happened automatically. When I realized that Tony was present, I felt ashamed and looked for something with which to cover myself. I found some napkins, but they were too small and I continued to search until I found a larger one. Once I was covered, I went to punish Tela, who continued to be in the same condition, and then she threw her panties on my face. I caught her strongly in order to slap her, but my arms were not strong enough. Anyway, I did slap her some but not as I would have wished to do it. When my mother arrived, I told her everything, and when she found out that Tony had witnessed everything, she went looking for my sister, like mad, and I don't remember if she hit her, but she did tell her that she would never forgive her this and that as far as she was concerned, she was dead. I felt more calm once my mother had recriminated her. Tony is 12 and Tela is 14; my mother is 46. My relations with Tela are more or less tense because she always wants to prove that nobody can tell her what to do, and she does not care if we cry as long as she gets what she wants. I get along with Tony much better. He is willful and wants to do as he pleases also, but less frequently than Tela. My mother does not have the strength to correct us. This dream was not pleasant. At the end, Tela was silent. I felt upset because of what had happened and Tony did not do anything; he was just a spectator."

In the dream when I saw her, I didn't feel joy as one would expect (perhaps this is because she wasn't my friend). Instead, seeing her caused me to be surprised and we greeted each other by saying hello. I was always rather distant with her, especially since I got to know her better and found out that she wasn't good for a friend. So this is how this second dream went, as I said, very vague and not clear at all, the way I see it, because most of the time I dream about things that happen to me during the previous day, and I was surprised to dream about her because I hadn't even thought about her."

Then the doctor came over to me and told me that my father was scared because they were going to try some shots that had been brought from another country on him, and that these cured Parkinson's disease (it's true that my father has the beginnings of this affliction). Just last month he went to the doctor and the doctor told him about a new drug to combat it that they have in France. Afterwards I went over to him and tried to calm him, because he was crying. I was speaking to him very calmly and telling him that he shouldn't worry about his hands shaking or about people and what they would think  when they saw him like that. He told me that he wasn't worried about that, but about the fact that if the disease progressed, he wasn't going to be able to write. Then I gave him a notebook and made him practice with his left hand so that if the right hand didn't work well, he could write with the other. I was also telling him that the disease became more pronounced at the age of 70 or 80 and that he shouldn't worry because he was still young, and that he should enjoy life and see it from a different viewpoint; that is, I was trying to raise his spirits. When I came out of the room, my mother's sister told me that what my father needed even more than medicines was to take a trip, go to the country and relax, because that disease had a nervous origin."

She just arrived yesterday and in my house we were commenting on her trip. I dreamt that she had arrived and that her youngest son, who is 2, didn't recognize her, and cried. She is 38 and we were all in her house, which is a large and pretty house. However, all of us were in the kitchen, which was small, and we were watching the child crying and not wanting to go near her. And while I was observing them, I was wondering what she had brought me as a present."

Once they had installed the telephone, my sister and I were very happy and we went out to go to the house across the street where a couple of old people live. They love us very much and they had let us use their telephone. They live with a servant. Anyway, my sister and I went out, but when we were going to cross the street, I was completely alone and it was 2 a.m and everything was dark. When I was across the street, I saw Ronald with bandages on his head and he told me that he had had an accident (yesterday afternoon he had a slight one). Anyway, I felt dreadful and I started to talk to him lovingly as I did when he was my boyfriend. He was also nice to me and we kissed, but I realized that it was nighttime and that we were on the street in front of my house, and that my father might appear at any time. And besides, I had to go and thank the people for the use of the phone. So I quickly got away from him and when I looked at the house of the people, it had changed entirely; it was dark, ugly, dilapidated and dirty, with a huge garden and very old door. They were looking at us from the window (they are always doing that). I went up the stairs and anxiously asked Ronald whether we would see each other the next day. He answered vaguely that we might and went on to his house. The door was opened for me; the maid, who is very nice, looked very different. The lady looked the same (she's fat and drunk), but at the same time there was another one who was also her, but who looked like a witch, with a long, dirty robe. I didn't want to go in, but they insisted and I didn't want to offend them. I timidly thanked them for their kindness and wanted to leave for home in a hurry, but instead of seeing the door, I kept seeing depressing rooms with Ronald inside. I got out quickly and when I was in the street, I saw my dog, who was barking, and I kept calling him, but he didn't pay attention to me. And then I don't know what happened. I remember only vague things, like a sunny garden where I was and at the same time I was breathing the fresh morning air, that is, dawn. That humid quality of dawn mixed with the smell of the tree that the family has at the entrance of their home. I felt that fragrance and the disappointment over the coolness with which Ronald had treated me and I was comparing his attitude with the one he used to have about me."

There was even blood and it didn't come out. We decided to leave that and return to our country. Coming out of that, we had to go through a labyrinth of dead-end streets, which were dirty and stank (my father, mother, siblings and cousin). We were able to get out of that horrible city and we started to go towards the frontier. Once there (we were in a car), they wouldn't let us through without going through a great deal of red tape that my father had overlooked. At any rate, we had to turn around halfway there and it was nighttime and it was in the country and the road was very narrow. My father suggested that we hide underneath the seats so that if anyone went by, they would only see two people, but one of them was fat. I don't know who she was, but there she was and it was difficult to get her under the seat. We arrived at the border and when we had almost gone through, they stopped us again so that my father would pay a certain sum of money. Then I got furious and jumped out of the car to scream at them and hit these men who were seated behind a table, like judges. They didn't wear uniforms. They were rather old men. I even wanted to hit one of them, and at that moment my dream ended."

We always study together; she is 18 and we love each other very much. She arrived and there were also other people whom I don't remember. We sat at the desk and when we were starting to study, a very large picture of a whole group of girls from my school appeared in my hand. The picture was old and we looked very different, and we laughed for a good while and a lot of classmates I thought I'd forgotten came to my mind. I knew that time was running and was getting ready to start studying again when -- I don't know why -- all of us went outside. We went down some wooden stairs and stood looking at the ocean. I felt great emotion looking at the ocean. Then we all went up to study again and I desperately felt that the time was running. but to my great surprise, I saw that all our notebooks were gone. We went down to look for them and everyone found theirs except me. I was desperately asking around and nobody knew where mine was. A little ways from there, there was another beach and I went there, but it wasn't there either, and I asked a fat girl about it (she was in a swimming suit) and she pointed towards some hats. And I got upset and told her that I wasn't looking for that. I was desperately aware of the time running out and all the rest were already studying, when suddenly I saw Ronald in front of me and he asked  me what my problem was, and I explained to him what was happening and he also started to search, but I told him I had already done that. When I raised my eyes, I saw another shore on the other side of the ocean and one could clearly see Ronald's car. I started to sigh and said that perhaps my notebook was in that place. As soon as I said that, he jumped in the water with clothes and all and started to swim (he does it very well). The fat girl and I stayed on the shore waiting. I continued to observe the beauty of the sea. She asked me who that boy was, and I told her that she would see that later. Ronald came back in his car over the water and when he arrived, he came to me and took my hand with great love and told me that it wasn't there either. Then I started to cry and wail and he tried to encourage me. Then I looked at the fat girl (unknown) and asked her if she already knew who he was and she answered that she did, with a knowing gesture. I don't remember any more, but I did continue to dream a lot of confused and outstanding things."

Anyway, we were on a small road surrounded by trees and we were singing because we were going to a club. The club had two entrances. One was next to the road where there was a cliff and a bridge which led to the club which was facing the cliff, and for the other entrance, one had to go around a long way in order to get in with the car because the bridge couldn't hold cars. We thought we would leave the car in front of the bridge and then go over the bridge. I was thinking whether it would support the weight of all of us. When we got to the place, there was a car in the same spot and we were furious because we didn't plan on finding anything there. We got off and there were some women. After asking them to move their car, they screamed at us because we became foul-mouthed while at the same time secretly realizing that they were right, because if they went over the bridge, it would break, but they also didn't want to leave us any room to leave our car with theirs. They were all dressed in black and when we got in the car, angrily, thinking about the long way we'd have to drive, one of the ladies called me by name and in a panic, I recognized that it was my great aunt (my father's aunt) whom they call Aunt Nona. She was very affectionately coming to greet me and I, terribly scared, started the car and we left the place."

The second one to speak was a boy named Edgar (also a classmate, very intelligent, cultured and able, whom I admire especially). He spoke brilliantly about Sophocles's tragedies. Then it was Louise's turn (a friend and classmate). She spoke alright, but was not able to narrow down her topic very well. Afterwards, Roland (a quite intelligent classmate) exposed his topic. I don't remember well what he spoke of or how well he did it. The fifth one to speak was Cindy (a friend and classmate, an intelligent and quite studious girl). But something strange happened with her, because instead of exposing a theme, the same as the others, she began to hum a song and to sing and dance. Together with her performance she presented another great number: it turned out that this girl had the power to transform herself into birds of multi-colored plumage and butterflies of extremely beautiful colors; besides she could transform her surroundings, changing the lighting. I believe it would be hard for me to explain the beautiful picture I had before my eyes. At last Cindy finished her performance and was applauded most of all. The last one to present a theme (which was I) did not fare so well. First, I did not know whether to give a talk or sing as the one before me had done. Finally, I decided on the latter, but in the meantime, the auditorium had been emptied, and the only ones left listening were Louise, the teacher, and Roland. In short, I was in a ridiculous situation, but I did not care and continued to sing until the end. Louise came over and started to make some criticisms; I was silent and accepted it. Going out, I tried to find Cindy. Once I found her I asked to explain how she had acquired those wonderful gifts. Cindy told me that it was Saint Martin who had given them to her. I continued to ask whether it was the black saint or Jose de San Martin. It was the latter who had given her those gifts as compensation for the effort that Cindy made in her studies and for having an altruistic spirit. But before this Cindy told me that to get in touch with San Martin, one had to go to the cemetery and stand watch by his grave all night. I thought that it was all a fantasy, an realizable dream, but perhaps it could turn into reality. I would give it a try and go to the cemetery and stand watch by the grave of San Martin."

The creatures chased us continuously with their weapons; they shot one of my comrades, and when he was hurt, he began to sink into the floor and was finally swallowed by it. They continued shooting their strange weapons and we started to do the same. They almost got me, but fortunately I was saved.

After finishing the refreshments, we came out of the café, and each one went his own way. I was still terribly hungry, and since I had no money, I had to go back to the café and steal two sandwiches. Ernest realized that I stole them and he started to chase me. I don't remember how I evaded him, but suddenly I found myself walking beside Agnes. I was telling her what had happened and was trying to justify my bad action by telling her of the hunger that I had felt at that moment.

Ernest, who had disappeared from the scene, reappeared, infuriated, in front of us. He kept on chasing me. I ran and ran until I could no longer run and I let myself be stopped by some policemen who were nearby. They told me that I had committed an unforgivable offense and that they would give me a death sentence. Suddenly the boy who had been following Agnes and me appeared and stated that my theft had not been voluntary, but rather motivated by the hunger I had felt. He made them see that they would have done the same thing under similar circumstances and that, therefore, it would not be fair to put me in jail. In spite of his speech, which was very convincing, he was not able to make them let me go. Desperate, I was able to run to the main exit of that small city, which led into a more highly developed one. In order to cross the threshold it was necessary for me to climb over steep terrain and avoid being caught by the policemen. Little by little I climbed until I finally arrived at the other city.

Immediately I went to the hospital; there the doctor (who was around 30 years old and had the same face as that of a psychologist I know and often talk to), started to cry when he saw me, probably due to the terrible state I was in. I felt faint. I was losing lots of blood, and I begged the doctor -- who so far had just stood there looking at me -- to operate on me. While the doctor treated me, I was biting my lips to the point where they were bleeding, so that I would drown the cry of pain coming out of my throat. Once the treatment had been done, the doctor asked me how the accident had occurred. I told him what had happened and added that I did not want to go back home because my mother would be waiting for me, angry, and that she would get even angrier when she saw me with my arms and shoulders bandaged. I began to cry. The doctor probably took pity on me and told me that there was nothing to worry about because he himself would take me home and speak to my mother. We got to my home, which was dark, and when we were talking to my mother I felt that I had some resentment against her. But later she was very nice to me and told the doctor that she would take care of me. Starting on that day, I dedicated myself exclusively to reading -- books were my life. I had read and meditated so much that my head started to develop (physically) and the time came when it got so big that, bit by bit, it began to disintegrate. The pieces started to take the shape of an enormous book. My mother appeared, crying, next to the doctor.

In the back of the garden that belonged to my grandparents' apartment there was something (I don't remember what) hanging from I don't know where. A classmate from the university was in the next apartment with his parents, and in the other one there was a gentleman, who I suppose was with his wife, since there was a double bed (she never appeared in the dream). The garden where \"that\" was became filled with boys and girls (youths) and everyone was looking at it. Some were coming and some were leaving. After a while, the only ones still in the garden were a small group of people which included my university classmate (he, in reality, has the same last name that I have). I was the only girl there; all the others were boys. One of them brought down the \"thing\" and I believe (I don 't remember well) that he started to move from one side to another and then to destroy it. I remembered just now! At the beginning the thing that everyone came to admire was a strange flower, but the thing that the boy brought down was no longer the flower. At the end it destroyed itself and each person went his way in the most normal manner. Between apartments there were curtains instead of walls, so that I  could see my classmate sitting down at the table, taking a plate and serving some salad for himself. My grandparents and my dad asked me what had happened (they had seen everything from the apartment), but I don't remember what I answered them, and I woke up. The surroundings in which this dream took place were completely unfamiliar to me. It was a pleasant dream."

It so happened that my brother was in that other bus. We got off and were standing by a lamppost when a couple of Arabs caught us and took us to their \"camp,\" which was nearby. We went in, deathly afraid, and found people doing Chinese or Japanese exercises (something like karate). After their practice, they grabbed me, lifted me, and wanted to take my clothes off with a sword. The guy who was going to do this, i.e., the one with the sword, did not look like an Arab. He had clear eyes and the features of a white man. He was very good-looking. He did not do it, and I don't know how, but I was able to escape. The two doors were opened, and I came out running and nobody followed me. but then I found a group of 3 or 4 who forced me to get back. I spent all the time with the one who was white. He was very nice, and he told me that he really wasn't an Arab, but that he had joined them because he liked their way of life. We went up on a roof to a point where we could look on the whole \"camp\" from up high, but they did not see us because some pieces of material were covering us. Afterwards we came down, and the people there, including my friend, started packing their things to leave. They didn't look at me like a stranger any more.

Nevertheless, I was cheering our team. The minutes were passing by and the game was very exciting. Suddenly, I don't know how, I saw the dining room at my house where I was listening to the game on the radio. It must have been 3 or 4 in the afternoon and there was no sun, and I was alone with my sister. The game continued to be exciting, when I saw a newspaper and took it and started glancing through it. When I saw a photo of a U.S. rock group, I looked at them intently; their faces seemed very expressive. It seemed a very clear picture or a mirror reflecting their image directly. The picture seemed to have been taken at a performance because it looked like they were singing. After looking at the picture, I got the impression of having gone inside it, because I found myself in a theater, big, full of lights, with a huge red curtain which opened immediately, and I could see the rock group on the stage. The lights were turned off and the spotlights went on. They were very brightly colored in red, blue, yellow, green -- the members of the group were dressed in black with colored accessories. They were dressed as \"hippies,\" had long hair and they all moved too much. The leader made gyrations with each of his screams. The sound was strident, although at times the music seemed sweet and melodic, but then the loud sounds were repeated. They were doing a very long song, and then I was told that the members of the group had taken drugs before the performance, which made me nervous, but I calmed down when I realized that I was with three friends of mine (I don't remember anything about them; they were girls) that I was not alone, but I had the idea that the police would be getting there any minute.

I got the impression that they did not want to get close to me. I couldn't understand this. I was alone, sad, and did not know how to get out of that situation. I knew that I could ask the people around me for help or try to communicate with them, ask them why they had that attitude. I understood this, but something seemed to stop me from doing it. I could not speak; however, I was not quite desperate because it made me happy to see the other patients talk among themselves, smile and wait for visiting hours. Every once in a while I would react to what was happening to me and I would look at the other patients, and try to catch their attention, making gestures. I would move back and forth in the bed, but since they did nothing about it, I felt like crying, but I controlled myself. Then a nurse appeared, and when she saw me like that, she looked at me mysteriously, and came back after a while with a shot which I did not want her to give me. I tried to defend myself, but she grabbed my arm with strength and gave me the shot. I think I fell asleep, but not too soundly because I heard noises of metal instruments being handled and I did not want to open my eyes. I heard voices whispering, men's and women's voices. I can't tell what they were saying, but an authoritarian voice said, \"To the room,\" \"To the operating room!\" It must have been the voice of a doctor. I felt that my bed was being moved. I wanted to speak, but could not do it, so I tried to move, but I was numb. I kept hearing voices, among them I recognized my mother's, so I wanted to make a big effort to speak to her. I was going to open my mouth and I saw a shadow in front of me. More or less at that point, I awoke. Surroundings: the hospital room where I was, was white, but there were cobwebs in the corners, everything was dusty, and the ceiling, walls and floor were cracked. The patients wore white and blue striped gowns, the beds and beddings were white. I did not know any of the patients, except I could tell they were older than myself.

I was in a classroom with a group of friends, hearing a reprimand from the principal, who was telling us that due to the lack of discipline, we would have to stay until 2 p.m. We stayed in the classroom, supervised by a proctor. My friends and I made fun of her, telling her that since she had to stay with us until 2, she was also being punished. I felt very, very happy because I knew that my boyfriend (at that time) was coming to pick me up; he was a cadet and when he got out, he always went to my house and if he did not find me there, he would go to my school. My friends and I were talking about our courses. I was a senior. We were telling jokes and talking about the parties to which we went, until the time came when they let us out. And, as I expected, my boyfriend picked me up and we left arm in arm. I was very happy next to him, but afraid to run into my father because both he and my mother couldn't stand my boyfriend because of their dislike of the military. I remembered that each time my father saw me with him, he would say to me, \"Let this be the last time that I see you with that cadet!\". And he got worse every time, so I was afraid we might run into him and that he would embarrass us. I told my boyfriend that they had punished us, and he said to me what he had once told me, \"They punish me at the Academy, so it's about time they punish you too.\" He was smiling when he said this, and we kept on walking. Suddenly I saw a big green car coming rather fast, and then I got scared. I looked quickly at the car and saw my father and other gentlemen (whom I did not know) in there, so I let go of my boyfriend and started running, and I saw him turn and look at the car, and he started running behind me. I was running as fast as I could, but he caught up with me and stopped me. I started to run again because I had turned around and seen my father with a gun, and he started to shoot. I was so nervous I couldn't run any more, and very tired, and I fell. When I was about to fall, my boyfriend caught me by the shoulder, but I had fallen already, as though I had fainted. Then it seems to me that I did not dream for a while, but later I was in my bedroom with my sister and she was saying to me, \"It's nothing. It's over now.\" And she repeated this several times. I felt hurt all over my body, and then I remembered about what had happened and about my boyfriend and asked about him, and she told me that he was alright in the Academy and asked me whether he was going to come Saturday. And I got the impression that she was lying to me, but I was too tired to talk and I let her go because she was about to leave. My mother came in to heal my knee, which was injured, and I sat up and saw that it was injured and it stung and hurt me. Then I wanted to ask my mother about what had happened. I looked at her and was going to do it when I realized that she did not like the military, and I did not tell her anything, but at that point I woke up."

There were dogs and people with their children on the dock, fishing. Suddenly night came and the tide started to rise. It rose so much that we all woke up and tried to run. At that point the waves got so high that they inundated the bridge with great strength. Many people fell off the bridge and drowned. My fiancé started to jump on the rock because he was at a lower height than we. We shouted for him to come up, but he could not do it due to the waves. The waves hit that rock furiously, and I was desperately shouting for him to come up, and then he slipped while jumping and blood was coming out of his knees.

I was deathly afraid that the same thing would happen to us there, but this place seemed safer. This place had houses around it and gardens.

I was in the bedroom with 2 boys of about 22 or 23 years who I now see often since we work together and we are friends. One of them starts to kiss me and fondle me, to which I strongly object, because besides my brothers are nearby (this boy courts me in real life), I think that I should not let this happen, but at the same time I don't make a strong enough stand to stop it. A little later I changed my clothes, and I remember distinctly that I put on a black pair of suede gloves, and I put my hands around his neck, telling him that I had put them on in order to strangle him. He starts kissing me again and fondling me all over, and I maintain a shy attitude. The dream might have produced a certain pleasure for me, but at the same time some shame and inhibition; but also a certain amount of calmness because in the dream itself I thought, \"It's not true; it's only a dream.\" The dream continued til the morning (9 a.m. more or less), even though in the background I could hear my mother's voice trying to get me up, and mine answering her, almost unconsciously.

In the dream she was already married, but she was marrying someone else and was giving a big party in that building.

She thought that she could not take her fancy friends and relations to \"that building,\" and was ashamed to do it. In short, neither my aunt nor my uncle attended the party. I, on the contrary, fixed myself up very nicely to attend it. I put on make-up so I would look nice. I went, I talked to her, I ate, I danced, but I was very worried because my sister had asked me to take care of her two-year-old daughter while she went to the party, and I had left her all alone, playing with another little kid whom I cannot identify, so that I kept going across the street to my house to see how she was. I remember well that I couldn't go to the ceremony because I was working, and that in order to save time I had gone to work in the party dress, to go straight to the party from work. I had situated work in the block next to my cousin's place, and therefore very close to my own house. But I had put on my dress without putting on make-up, and that upset me so much that I wasn't calm until I found a chance to put make-up on. I saw my cousin, dressed in white, at the moment she came into her house, surrounded by people. I was asking her why she had married another man. Among the guests was her ex-husband who, naturally, was in his own home. I also remember that I was desperate when I was trying to amuse my sister's daughter, and I was missing the party, and she would run away from me, and I would have to chase her and bring her back by the hand."

I must confess that when I awoke, I thought this incident was true and that the dream had really taken place, and that their reaction (my uncle's and aunt's) had been okay. Thinking about it a good while, before breakfast, I remembered that this had never happened, and that everything was in order. I must disclose the fact that I would have wanted something like this to happen, because the problem went as follows: A few days ago, my brother's fiancé came to my home while my cousin was visiting. I told my cousin that this was a person my mother knew, and she, due to something that was said, thought that she was my grandmother's godchild. Naturally I only told her this because my brother had recently been engaged and he expressly asked us not to tell the family about it, in order to avoid comments due to the young age of the bride-to-be. But my mother could not hide the fact any longer and when my uncle came to pick up my cousin, she told him that her son's fiancé had come, but she didn't say anything to my cousin, and she didn't find out. The worst of it is that this incident has left me very nervous, and I don't even want to go to my cousin's because then she will ask me why I didn't tell her, etc. It's been a week since my cousin's visit, but all the members of my family, including my parents and myself, are very nervous about the reaction of the other members of my family. I think that this has influenced my dream a lot. Coming back to the dream: I remember that my uncle was telling my cousin, \"You are a fool; you shouldn't have said anything,\" and my aunt, \"What they must have thought!\" My cousin was answering, \"But I didn't buy the magazines, they gave them to me; besides, what was I to do? They were not going to throw me out of the house for letting him know that they were keeping so many magazines and hadn't paid taxes for them.\" Her parents were still reproaching her, her lack of tact, until she lowered her head and left, while they made angry faces, as though they were angry at themselves."

I saw several people sitting in front of me and talking to my mother, but they didn't look at me or ask me what I was doing. They seemed to be ignoring me. Afterwards my father came and told me to go because it was raining. I bundled up and we left with the little girl who did not speak. I saw my uncle Ollie come out of the house with his children. They were going home in a blue car. We walked a lot in the rain, and in a hurry. I remember that my slacks were black and wide-bottomed, and that I had put on my coat on the wrong side, because I could see the blue lining. We were in the car. It was a two-way street, and almost all the cars -- there were trucks also -- were parked. My father had carried the child and after a while we got to the car. I and the girl sat in the back seat and my father was at the wheel. In the car we arrived at a school. I recognized the gate of my high school, but inside it was totally different."

We were walking there when we saw a bus coming very fast on the sidewalk, so we quickly had to get on the roadside. We arrived to the theater at the intermission and there were no more tickets. But afterwards we were inside the theater and we paid $1.00 each because we were students. The man who sold us the tickets was bald, fat, and Spanish, and he spoke to us, singing. Inside the theater we looked for my other sister. Facts: My sisters: Mary (the one who went to the theater with me) is 23, she studies at the university. Veronica is 26; she lives in Paris where she works for an airline."

When I went in, I found another friend who was waiting for me to go see a ship, but we had to wait till the maid arrive because nobody was home and I had to leave word of where I was going.

But I don't know how, when we went out the door, there was a bunch of gentlemen of around 40 or 50 years who were waiting for us to get into the ship. My friend got in, but I couldn't because I said I felt uncomfortable with the clothes I had on and I asked them to wait for me to change. This time I went into a house that was on a second story, while mine is on the first, as though it were mine. I ran up the stairs and saw my mother and father who were asking me where I was going. I told them that I had been invited and that I had to change into slacks. I went into my room, and it was just as it is, except that for some reason I couldn't find the clothes that I was looking for, especially the shoes. I spent hours desperately trying to find them until I realized that my father had left some shoes he had bought for me on top of the dresser. There were many shoes, but in different sizes, all the same color and shape, and to my surprise, I realized that they were the ones I used in school. I put them on, but I realized that they did not have any straps to tie them, so I desperately searched everywhere until I found a pair of old shoes underneath my sister's bed and took the straps out and put them on mine. At that moment two girls about my age came up; one had black hair and the other brown, and they told me to hurry, that they had been waiting for me for quite a while. I don't know either of them. The brown-haired one stood at the bottom of the stairs and the black-haired one came up to the top of the stairs and stood there. My mother went over to talk to her and I felt very uncomfortable. I felt that the clothes I had on were bothersome and that they didn't match. I saw myself uncombed and in disarray. In contrast, the black-haired girl had a party dress on and my mother told me she was very pretty. Then we descended the stairs and I saw a ship at the door of my real house (not the one on the second story). It was a war ship and the heads of the gentlemen I had previously seen were sticking out from it. I don't know if I went inside or not because at that moment everything became blurry or I don't remember what happened."

We were walking through some streets that I don't know, but in my dream they were familiar to me. I was carrying one of her babies because she didn't want to carry it. The street was peculiar; it was filled with religious images, lit with candles. We walked, looking at these images, talking and laughing, until we reached or somehow got to her house, which wasn't really her house, but my grandfather's house. When we went in, her mother and nieces and nephews (between the ages of 1 and 12) were there. Her husband, who is also my friend, asked us where we had been and, I don't know why, my friend answered that we had been talking to some boys, friends of mine from the university. I then told him that they were really nice, but he was angry. Then my friend asked me to prepare some food for her children, and I said no, that she should do it herself, but as usual I started to fix something. Then they served some soup for the rest of us and my friend's husband asked me what I thought of the meat I was eating, because he thought it was terrible. His wife disagreed because she thought it was good. Then he said that he was going to the movies to see \"Candy.\" I told him I had already seen it and he started to say that I shouldn't see certain types of movies which weren't any good.

I went up the stairs and she told me she was going to go on a diet because she was getting fat (she's really thin). Then I told her that this was because she had so badly wanted to gain weight and now she had to lose some. Then there was another girlfriend sitting in the living room and she started to speak (I don't know what about). The sister and some friends of my friend passed in front of us and we greeted them. Then my friend said that her mother was in the bathroom near where we were. The mother called her to ask her if she looked well because she was going out. When I saw her, I saw it wasn't her mother, but a geography teacher we had in school. At that moment I appeared in my home again. The same people were there, but a friend of mind had also arrived and she was sitting at the edge of the bed. Then I went out to see if I had received mail from a friend who writes to me, and when I went out, I saw a boy who had been my boyfriend standing there. I greeted him and went straight to pick up the mail. My father came out and didn't greet him, and asked me what I was doing and I said I was looking for my mail, but there was none for me. I went over to my ex-boyfriend and told him that my friend was inside and he said he wanted to speak to her, but I didn't want him to come in and I told him that she was trying on clothes and that my mother was sick. He was angry because my father hadn't even looked at him. Then my mother started to complain about something or other. In order not to be embarrassed, I told him we should go and we started walking toward his car, which was in a garage a block away from my house, but as we walked, we kept hearing my mother's screams, complaining. I was worried about what he would think and told him to excuse her because she was sick. He looked serious but was hugging me. We got to his car, which was a sports car and didn't look like the one he has. He took a telephone out and called a girl to ask some questions of her about something he wanted to know. Then he hung up and kissed me. At that moment I awoke."

This called our attention and we were asking each other questions. In spite of being surrounded by so many people, I felt lonely. At this point I turned around and saw a group of three girls, among whom there was a friend who went to school with me (she sat next to me in school and we formed a quartet which we called ARAB from the initials of the four names; it's the best way to describe her). When we started to talk, I remembered that she had relatives in Chimbote and I asked her if her family was alright, if nothing had happened to them in the May 31st earthquake which affected that zone. She told me that two of her brothers had died. Then she laughed and said it was a lie, and I was so relieved! I also asked her about her brother (older than she) whom we used to tease when she wrote letters to him in school. She told me he was alright and that he always remembered the quartet that teased him. I don't know how I got away from them and I became like a child in my behavior. I wanted to play, jump, laugh, because I felt lonely and bored. I could see the group of boys doing their thing on one side and the girls on the other. Then they started to come toward me one by one because they were also bored. I had tried to call their attention. We started to look at the stores and then we saw a group of foreign sailors and we thought we would introduce ourselves to them and did so.

One of the girls who knew English started to translate what they and we were saying. Since I didn't understand anything in English, because I always studied French, I felt kind of strange and kept getting more bored. The girl who knew English had graduated from a British school which is near my home and her parents are North American. I know several girls from that school and know that they come out speaking English perfectly, but I don't remember this girl. Truthfully, she wasn't one of the ones I know. That was all of my dream, because I awoke at that moment."

In the first place I was at home, but the structure of the building was different. My mother was with me and she was sewing a robe. When we looked out the window to see the street, we saw Fanny, a friend of mine, in front of the house (19 years old). I was telling my mother, \"Look how much weight she's lost.\" I was about to call her when she told me not to because she was playing volleyball with some friends. I could really hear the ball bouncing. When we looked out the window later, we saw she was inside the car in which we had seen her before, lying there with her friends and in the back of the car. There were some North American girls that had come to Peru on a cultural exchange. Fanny talked to my mother and told her that her mother had also made herself a silk robe. She asked my mother about that material she was using to make the robe and its quality, and told her about some material that I don't remember which I have never known about. Then the North American girl asked me about the number 7 bus line, which took you to another one (10 or 14). Since I didn't know, I told her so. Then I remembered several bus lines -- 10B, 70, 14 -- which go by my house. While I was thinking of them, I was already walking with my friend Mary (19 years) through a row of hills. We wanted to come down from there and we walked horizontally until we reached a road that was almost vertical, which led to another which was in between two hills. We came down, almost running, and then I remembered that one day in Punta Hermosa (a southern beach) I had done the same thing and had gathered so much momentum that when I reached the road, which was narrow, I had to keep climbing the next hill until I could stop, so I wouldn't fall (this really happened to me and I remembered it in my dream). We continued on the path, which was rather broad, and we were saying that we had to go back because our parents were waiting for us. But after walking a while, we saw a couple of North American sailors, with two girls from the same country, behind us. Mary told me we should go over to them and we did this, and we decided to go to the beach. Following the path, we arrived at a sandy place and couldn't see the sea, but when we walked three steps from there, we saw it. I was asking myself why we hadn't seen it before. I thought that perhaps because I was short, but this was not it. I saw my brother swimming and he called me to the beach, but later I didn't see him any more. Then Mary and I took off our slacks and our blouses and we already had bathing suits on. When I started to swim, it seemed to me that the sea was rough and pulling me and I wanted to get out, but couldn't. Then a big wave came, bringing lots of jelly fish, and I was scared of them (I am) and I came out in a hurry. When I got out, I saw my mother, father and brothers coming and I went toward them, getting away from the group of Mary and the sailors because of what m parents might think. I could hear what they were saying, because they were speaking Spanish. Then my mother started to put some cream on my head, telling me that it was so that the sea water would not spoil my hair. but I didn't want to go in because there were jelly fish. (Fanny and Mary are friends of mind and I like them very much and appreciate them.)"

I had been in class and then one of the professor called my 10-year-old sister and asked her to recite the lesson and she did it very well (this amazed me because when she recites her own lessons, she gets stuck with words). Everybody applauded her. Among the students and sitting in the third row was my mother. Becky, my sister, addressed her and told her that she had studied for her, and I got upset and told her to sit down. In my dream there were two boys I like, I am attracted to them. It was strange to see them in the classroom because they really study in different classes. Seeing the attitude I had taken towards my sister, A. was looking surprised at me. He was just behind me, but I didn't care at all. The other one, B., was sitting in the same row as my mother, but his hair was lighter. When I turned to look at my mother, she was no longer there. I remember having seen her later on and asked her if she had seen B. and told her that he looked better every day. To this she replied that he seemed to have changed (in real life, my mother doesn't know him, has never seen him and has just heard me talk about him). Later on, since the class was over, I went out in the hallway and found Fanny (female, 19) who asked me to go to the department offices with her, and while we were there, I saw to my surprise that the Dean of the school was Sister Angela (she is a nun who was, and still is, the principal of my high school). When we asked for the results of our tests, the lights went out (according to the nun, all over the school), but when I returned to my class, they were not out and the others weren't either. The boys were getting ready to pull a practical joke and had drawn the caricature of a man on the board. When I went it, I sat at another place where another friend of mine from school (who didn't get into the university) was sitting with her younger sister. The boys who were in back of us started playing with our caps. They took them off and put them back on. Anyway, they messed my hair. Some boys who were in front were laughing. I got angry. Angie had to comb my hair (in real life, I have never played with the boys). Then Sister Angela arrived and made us get out of the room because, according to her, the lights had gone out, even though these were on. She led us through a corridor to a door and, opening it, she made us go into a church. I knew its name. I said it is such and such, but I didn't know it. They made us go in and sit on benches and a priest who was saying Mass interrupted it in order to teach us Theology. I was sitting on the first bench and was amazed. A moment later he interrupted the class and continued with the Pater Noster of the Mass, but in order to say it, he gave a plate of food which we had to exchange with each other and nobody should have the same plate that they had at the beginning. Only one girl cheated (if you can call it that) and kept the same dish. Well, this happened only with a few of us (among them myself) because the rest of the girls had disappeared. The priest made us sit at the table where the religious act was being done. That's all; we were sort of playing at the altar. I had forgotten a detail -- at the university we were all in our old school uniform (the one used in 4th grade). I don't remember whether the boys were wearing uniforms."

There were more people there than in reality and more men (in my class there is only one). I didn't want to go out and take the test by any means and kept waiting to the last moment. A boy who is the brother of a friend of mine (both are in the university, but I never speak to him) came into the class. I remember he came in and sat the wrong way, in order to talk to a girl; he seemed to me to be very uneducated and uncouth. Then he went out of the class just as freshly as he had come in. I remember there were only three people left to take the exam: a boy, Silvia (a friend of mine who studies English instead of French at the same Academy or school of languages, and studies with me at the university) and I. Silvia and I looked at each other and got away, leaving the boy to take the test before us. Then I remember having gone to the yard or garden and putting on the swimsuit there to take the test. My cousin Dotty (20 years) who had not been in the dream at any other point was next to me, also in a swimsuit. Then I came out to take the exam and everybody was teasing me because I had a bathing suit on and I told them that I had it on because I knew they were going to get me wet and didn't want my clothes to be spoiled.

When we passed him by, I imitated his laughter, making fun of it, and my mother and I got away laughing. Everything caused us to laugh. The man I had imitated was following us everywhere and that made us laugh, it was like openly flirting with him. The man was approximately 28 or 30 years old. Then we got to a street where there was a small neighborhood bookstore, which in my dream was the administration office at the university. The exams of the History of Culture were there, tied as though they were a bundle of newspapers. I seized the occasion to ask for mine. I had to search through the bundle to find mine, and in order to do that I had to pull out the ones on top and place them on the side. When I found mine, the other exams had been already given out, according to me, because there were only a few left. When I saw my grade, I didn't laugh anymore because I had flunked, I had gotten 40. Then I told my mother, \"They flunked me, I could never raise that grade. This happens to me because of having laughed so much.\" In real life, I have always had the notion that when I laugh a lot, I will then cry; something will happen to make me cry.  I always think about this when I laugh too much. Now, about dreaming of flunking, this always happens. Whenever they are going to hand me a grade, I dream about that test, I see a grading notebook or some such document, and I always dream that I flunk. Then, when I see my grade it's a passing one. In this instance, this has happened too. I've come out alright, I've passed the test."

I would tell her that this wasn't the one. So it happened about three times until I took it and we went inside to wrap it. There were shelves filled with toys and a girl who was looking at us. She told me it cost about $10, and I told her that I didn't have that much, only about $5. Then I told her that I would leave the small radio I had as a deposit. And when she had it, I told her that I was only leaving it because it was an expensive radio; it was foreign. She took it and liked it and then I realized that it was too much, that I should only leave the money. She didn't want this. She told me it was the radio or nothing. I took the radio from her and at that point a friend called Mary came to tell me that another friend had come to pick me up in a car because I was supposed to study with her. I went out running and got in the car, and the first friend was left alone. I didn't know what to do. The car had already started. Inside my friend Rose had a baby with her and her aunt was driving, and there was a good-looking girl, who was angry, next to her. She turned around and started to lick the baby's face and Rose took her away."

She knew the route very well, and the driver liked the idea and gave her his seat. We got to the movies. Next to it was a store. In it they sold stuff for hair care. I asked for a couple of things and put one of them in the bag I was carrying, without meaning to keep it, but the salesgirl didn't see it that way, I think. We went into the movie theater, which was very nice, and we sat in the front rows. In the movie I saw an actor I like very much and I don't remember any more."

I tried it on and found that it was too big, and I immediately thought I would fix it up and wear it. I also thought that fashion these days is very similar for both sexes."
