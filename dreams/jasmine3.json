The concept is supposed to be so scary and so horrible, which it kind of is, but it's more cool than anything, you know what I mean? So last night I dreamt that Sandra like came to me in my sleep and like laid down next to me, and somehow I had the notion that she was undead and she was like visiting me. And she wasn't going to, she didn't scare me, she wasn't going to take any of my blood, but I was going to like give her some so that she could like come back to life or something dumb like that.  And that's all that there is to it. I kind of faded into consciousness."

            "content": "I had a crazy, but fascinating dream last night. First of all, there were like several things to it. First of all I dreamt that I got several birthday presents, at this time of the year -- yes, birthday presents! Maybe because Terri gave me a late birthday card or something. One of them was this mechanical baby doll that like it was the form and the stature of a real person, of a full-grown person, but it acted like a baby doll. Its arms like would reach out to you and it would laugh and say, \"Mama\" and stuff like that. And if it was turned on, it would just do that periodically at any time. And my father was like, \"That thing! How are you ever going to get any sleep?\" But he didn't realize that all you had to do is turn it off and it wouldn't do that any more. And I thought it was a really special gift from somebody, I don't remember who. Then I dreamt that I was studying media in college and I needed something to help me study it, and my father and I went to this electronics store to get one and the one, the Peavey one that we were looking at was really, really good. It was kind of a mixer and bat kind of combined into one unit. And then there was this other one that was even better and this was the funniest part. The Peavey one that we were looking at spanned three octaves, but this other one spanned like six octaves, and so my father wanted me to have the Peavey one, but he wanted the store person to cut the other one in half and attach the half to the Peavey one and make it one unit.  I don't get that! And the store owner said, \"Well, there's a much easier solution. We have a larger Peavey model.\" And so we ended up getting the larger Peavey model. And then I dreamt that I was working for the Giants, and not like a DJ but to do like paperwork and stuff. And I had a desk in their offices, and somehow -- I don't remember how -- but I must've put it on my desk. And there was this other girl who had a desk next to me who was studying video and stuff also, and we decided we were going to like hear it, and then I can't remember, but I was off running errands for them or something, and I come back and somehow somebody had talked me into just giving it to her, and getting another one with my gift card, and so I had this nice, perfect model and when I got back to my desk it wasn't there. And then I like rolled around or something like that and then I woke up. And then I was like half conscious, but having other little tiddly dreams but keeping that thought in mind that, I don't know. Then I woke up. I have a little bit more of an explanation about the baby doll part of this dream, now that I've been thinking about it. When I was little, I had two kind of small talking baby dolls. One was supposed to be a boy and one was supposed to be a girl. One was from Brittany and Jane and one was from Aunt Peggy. And they would laugh and they would say, \"Mama,\" but they wouldn't like reach out to you or anything. And I think, oh, I know what, when their batteries kind of ran down, they talked like this [low stretched-out voice] and they sounded like an old man, kind of like my tape sometimes. And that was just so weird.  I think I might have been thinking about that."

But I was in this room, like a dance studio, and Sheryl and me and my mother and this strange instructor person were in there, and they were showing me a trumpet, of all things and they wanted me to just try it out and see how it felt. And I could feel the finger things and I remembered when -- I don't know -- it was just weird.  And then we went out to this main like cafeteria area and there was a, it was empty and there was a piano in there and some girl was like playing. And I was like walking through there to get out to the door to go out, and the instructor person who was with us gave me this little book, thumbnail size book of songs. And then when I got out to the car, my father and somebody else were there to pick us up, but I realized that I left my MD machine in the room, so I had to get out and run back in. By this time the cafeteria was full of people, and noisy students. So I went back and got my machine and then I went, then we went to this like funeral thin, I guess for like James Walton's my father, and I was kind of perplexed because we said we weren't going to go. And somehow I got separated from everybody else and I was like sitting behind the first row and I was watching the thing going on. Then when it ended, everybody kind of got up and left and I was like left in there. And I got up and I started walking. There was this big, long and there was this big complex at the funeral center, and as I got up and I started walking, there was like this bridge over the pool, and so I walked over that and I started to cross the front lawn. And then this lady came out and stopped me and said that this path was going to lead me into private property because there were condos over there. And she was going to lead me like back to the parking lot. And so she led me to this path that had these sprinkler heads sticking up that you could trip over at any minute, and we were walking along this path and suddenly they came on and sprayed all over us. And then we got to this like little clearing area deep in the woods and somehow my mother found us and found out where I was and went back to the car and told everybody. And I don't remember ever getting back there. I woke up before I got back."

My father said when he was snooping around out back he found these alligators trying to get at these chickens, and a few of them were dead already, but the alligators were in the water and the chickens were up on the thing. And he got two or three of the chickens out of the way, and I can't remember, one of them had like chicken wire wrapped around its ankle, and I don't remember what all the ruckus was about, but I think it was that somebody like fell in the water and they like jumped out, but Aunt Polly saved Mr. Thomas and Mrs. Dougherty. That was weird. And we were all like packed into their bedroom, just talking and visiting and chatting and yakking and carrying on, and my father's laying there on the bed totally exhausted, wanting to go to sleep. And here we are visiting and talking and carrying on. And so it was really, it was Jack and Polly and all of our family and we were like having a family thing. And then I dreamt that -- oh, I know -- somehow we were supposed to have taken a trip up to their house, but somehow I had the notion that our sound system was in their living room, and Jack and Carl and my mother were watching a movie. And I was going to tell Jack how the system is wired, but I never got around to it. But then I dreamt that my mother and I went to this park to swing on their swings, and one of them came undone because she was trying to figure out where Ohio is. How dumb! And also we went to this library because I needed some kind of book on psychology or something, and I turned the ______ and had to go to a big philosophy library that was right next door. And we were set off to drive all the way back to my home state, and then I woke up."

But I couldn't find any of them to show her. And somehow I dreamt that I had the notion that I was at school and time to get out so that I could get to the parking lot where they were going to pick me up. Well, at school the halls were like flooding and they had water up to my ankles, and I took my shoes off so that they wouldn't get all wet, but from taking off my shoes I couldn't keep my balance as well, and there wasn't much more to it."

So I sat down on this railing to this stairwell and I was taking stuff out of my purse that I didn't need, like this vitamin bottle with one vitamin in it and these papers and stuff, and I called my mother on the cell phone and she couldn't really tell me a lot. And she was there like within two or three minutes of me calling, and she was saying that I should try to meet up with Mrs. H.'s group but I didn't know where they were, and I think they had left already. And so, as it turned out, it was like late at night and there was nobody around to help me out, and they shut off the lights for the stairwell and I like started freaking out. And I just decided I wasn't going to go, and I like ripped my ticket and I got my bags, and I was ready to go home. And then I woke up."

So we continued with the party. Nobody else came over, but we had kind of a party ourselves, but it was in the middle of the day, and I don't know why I would do a party in the middle of the hottest part of the day outside. And then I dreamt that I was at this like class in this portable classroom, and they were doing this stuff and somebody was telling this story about how, if you were in the military and then you leave, you wear your armor home and then you take it off, and then it jumps under your skin and you can never get ride of it, essentially a symbolistic thing.

Okay, last night I dreamt that my mother and I were coming home from somewhere and it was kind of late at night, but then again I had the notion that it was in the afternoon. And she, I was kind of laying on the bed when we got home, and my mother got this big box from her room and I was laying down, almost asleep, so I couldn't see it. But I could hear her taking something out of the box, and she said she got me an early present and she couldn't resist showing it to me. It was supposedly a keyboard that spans like five octaves. And she plugged it in and she started playing me a song, and, you know, she was good! I can't remember what it was, but she was good. And then she played me a second song and for some reason I didn't clap and go \"Whoo!\" or anything. I was just laying there half asleep.  And I didn't realize it until she had put it back in the box and then it was like all kinds of stuff on the bed, like rollers and shampoo and clothes and bags and purses, and I like knew that's on the bed. I wanted to see how big the box was. And I realized, I was like, \"Wow!\" So she was going to put the box like up in her work room. And then, for whatever reason, she decided [end of tape]...."

She had, I can't remember, I think it was something like the fact that the state mandated that shove a couple more lessons down our throats and she didn't get to it. And in order to cover her hide, we had to go back ten days after we graduated and get a little more. And then Mr. Johnson decided he was going to do that too. And I had to go to the Wa______ and I was trying to figure how to get all this in at once. And it was kind of weird. I can't remember much of what happened, but the gym was like this big open, dark area and it just was different. And I woke up and I realized it was only a dream, and I was so grateful. But then I went back to sleep and I dreamt that I was in a dollar store with this little boy, and I had to buy certain things. And I was buying these gummy dinosaurs, and I like took a handful of them and I took them up to the counter and I paid 10 cents each, and then I woke up."

And we each got one of these little pizza things where you rip off a piece of crust and you scoop some stuff, and that's how you're supposed to eat it. Well, I finished that and then my father came to take me home and it was flooded. I mean, we were practically swimming through the parking lot; the water was up to our chest. And in some cars there was water like halfway up the doors, but with ours somehow we were in a lower area, it was like only a little bit up to the tires, I guess. And the funny thing was, he started backing out and maneuvering out with the door hanging wide open, and he said that he was going to honk real loud to make sure he got all the way out of the radiator, which I don't understand.

And, you know, like they had relay races and stuff -- well, this was kind of an odd type of a relay race thing that a family could do. What it was, was when there's a lightning storm and the power goes out, some of the things that you can do to salvage things. And the first thing was you had to run all the way down to the end of the block and make sure that the transformer was still intact. Then you had to run back to your house and turn off your main circuit breaker in your panel box. Then you had to run inside and change your equipment to run on DC, and I don't know where we would get that from. I didn't remember anything about any kind of a generator, but I thought, \"Oh, how neat!\" Two other people did the going down the street and coming back to the house and all, and I would change, our sound system receiver had some kind of a switch to go from AC 110 to DC 12, and once it was in DC 12 mode, 12 volts, it would revert to this weird surround recording room that had a ____ and two surrounds and nothing else. And we were going to play a CD or something, or watch a movie, I don't remember what. But I think I was going to do it out while the storm was brewing and banging outside, and I don't remember exactly all the details; it's kind of foggy now. But that's what it was.

And what it was, was a story about a lotus blossom, and it was this leaf that died and in the next life turned into a little branch, which died and then in the next life turned into a flower and then a bigger branch, and then finally a tree. And it was talking about the venerable tree and how there's different trees in different countries, and how respected they should be. And then in the very last part, a bird lands on this tree and the bird becomes the friend of the tree.

And I was back at my high school, or my college -- I couldn't figure out which one it was. And she was helping me find my room numbers for next year's classes. I think it was Latisha from the Wilcox Center. And she was showing me where my psychology class is, but she said that if I go too far to one side, past the psychology class, I would be in the Special Ed Department and there were all kinds of whackos in there that I didn't want to be around. And so she advised me to go around one way to get to the other thing. And then we met up with Sheryl and Sam, who had driven down, I guess, and Latisha kind of turned me over to them and went about her away. And Sheryl and Sam and I were trying to find an elevator to get down and we found one. We got down and out to this like pool area, and it looked like the pool was outside, but I guess it really wasn't, because it was an echoey echo chamber around there. And I can't remember if I wanted to get in and swim or not, but I remember that it was an echoey echo chamber. And Sam went in there started walking around and around the perimeter of the pool, saying, \"It collapsed, it collapsed, it collapsed! The World Trade Center collapsed!\" And this was kind of upsetting Sheryl, but she didn't want to show it.  I mean, this is totally off the wall, but that's what he did in my dream. And then we got back in the car for some reason, and we were going to go home, and Sheryl was like laying in my lap and crying. She was like the size of me and I could like support her, and her legs were like falling on the floor. I could support her body. And she had dark hair like me. And, but I knew she wasn't me; she was Sheryl. And then we kept driving, and then Sam was talking about next time maybe that my mother can run him down. And about that time I woke up."

We were winding up all of our dolls and our animals and things and we were making a parade the way I used to do when I was little. And she was listening to like a personal CD player. And she was lining up some baby dolls and stuff. And her mother came back and told us we should totally stop that because that's immature; that's like kids' behavior. And then I woke up.

My mother had her own machine just like mine in her work room and her monitor was up on her high boy dresser. And I was like kneeling up on the stool, so that I could see it, and Sam had composed this rap thing with Midi(?), and I was going to like go over it and sing some melody, like Ashanti sings for Javol (?) and Beyonce sang for JV (?).

And I had to go down to get something. I had to talk to Ms. Fletcher or somebody, so I took the elevator down and then came back up.

And there was like a dance party going on, except the sound system was kind of low and it wasn't really all that loud. But there was cluddy techno going on, and I was with Astrid and Linda and there were some families and parents and things there. And there were some like bleacher seats, as though we were at my hometown's Jordan Center or something like that. But there was this big open foyer for us to dance around and then there was a stage. And I would be like, I would meet Astrid and Linda around, and then I would leave them with some other people and then I would go mingle around with some other people and then I was going to just dance. And they kind of toned it down a little and they were getting ready to do this show. And what it consisted of was this animal trainer person who was there, and had an alligator that was like almost twice the size of a chichahua dog and he was on a leash and they were walking him around the stage. And all of us people from the Wilcox Center had to line up and walk up on stage and go by and pet the alligator and say something to it.  This is getting so bizarre! And then everybody was suddenly dressed like so nice.

And before I could get up to the stage to the alligator, I kind of faded into another scene. I was in my studio and Terri was over working on my machine. And I had two monitors because what were supposed to be able to do is work from the PC and the Mac at the same time with the same mouse, but two keyboards and two monitors. And I can't remember what I was doing, but I was doing some kind of a script or something for that show. I was doing the audio and DP and the typing in Word all at once, and Terri was helping me. And then I just faded into consciousness."

And I was trying to, well, first of all before any of this, the DART cab was coming to pick me up, and I had to run back to the house to get something and I was carrying my Wilcox Center bag in my other hand, and it was so heavy, and I kept tripping and falling and tripping and falling. When I finally got back to the house I asked my mother for some money so I could pay the guy and she gave me some. And then I was there and the security guard stopped me and was talking and talking and I was late for class, and I went up to this portable that was supposedly the Social Arts Building and there was like this little doggie door that was like the first door that I could get in. And I like opened and it and it went, \"Squeak\" real loud and then I just closed it and I stood outside. And when the teacher came out a regular door, and he was like, \"Come on in and sit down. This is the first day, and I've had a lot of people late today. Just come in and sat down.\" And so I did. And there was this assistant that was sitting by me, like Elizabeth would, and this assistant kind of reminded me of Randy. The teacher and the assistant kind of seemed to be doubles of each other, and doubles of this stranger person that was kind of like Randy. And they were talking about these chant songs and these songs with these sounds and these words in them, and the words were like all jumbled and we had to kind of make something of them. And there was this one that was like, \"Leah, Leah, __________\" -- they kept screaming that name, and other students in the class were talking about how in that culture that Leah was a higher spirit, a higher power that they were chasing. And the teacher passed out a packet of papers, it was like a booklet of these different words and what they meant, and his assistant was prodding me to go over to a CC TV and look at it and read what it says, so I could ______ with the rest of them. And I was kind of feeling like I shouldn't bother because I could always look at it at home and I should just listen now. And then I kind of started to fade into consciousness, and I realized, \"Hey, this is only a dream. It's only July 18th or 19th. I don't have to study yet.\" And that's when I kind of went back to sleep and faded into the dark."

And I don't remember too much except there were these things that some black girl copied off the board for me, and I could hardly read her handwriting, but I did recognize this formula that was kind of weird, and I couldn't put my finger on it right at the moment, but then I thought about it and I decided that that formula was the formula for finding the frequency of a note. And then I think -- I can't remember what we were doing -- everybody was kind of at a place that had a regular desk and then some other stuff. And for whatever reason, right at that moment I was out of class and I was setting up the Peavey system in this big open foyer because somebody was going to have a wedding or a party or some kind of a reception. And I turned it on kind of low, I thought it sounded from behind, but I guess from the front it was a little louder. Up in the balcony there was this guy that was yelling at me to turn it down some. And while I was like on the floor in this big open wooden floor, huge area rug room and there was these balconies all around, I guess kind of like the rotunda at the Dome except it was square and it had a wooden floor, but the acoustics were the same. And then, once it was on and I was kind of playing some easy listening stuff, I got word that the party had been like postponed for an hour or so, so I shut everything down and I was back with the class and we were going up this set of stairs to this band room. We weren't really in a line, we weren't going in any kind of order. We were just clumsily traipsing up the stairs. And this lady -- Irene Doppley or something like that -- I don't know who she was, but she pulled me aside and she gave me this present. And I was home in my studio and I opened it, and it was this inline amplifier that's supposed to make a signal from a microphone or instrument stronger with a little bit of effect before it goes like to a main house system. And it was like a little bigger than this tape machine. So that was really bizarre."

And we had six periods a day, just like in high school. And fifth and sixth period we could go to by ourselves, but first through fourth we had to follow behind her in a line and she would leave us with these teachers and then come and check back with us. I think that was kind of a development from the Wilcox Center. This one class was supposed to be -- I can't remember why -- but in my dream I couldn't really stand up right. I had weak muscles and I kept wanting to let my head just drop to in front of my chest, and I couldn't hold my shoulders up straight. And the teacher dropped us off. We were in this big foyer, kind of like the Wilcox Center auditorium, and this professor was, I think it was Dr. Stephan from my college, and he was leading this chorus of people a little young than me singing, \"_____________\" and so on and I wanted to go and join with them, so I came to the front of the line and the front of the like block of people and I stood. And again, I was having trouble holding myself up straight, and that one teacher kept coming over to me and tipping my head up and like straightening my shoulders and I just could not hold them up straight. Then, as we were singing and breathing and learning the song, the floor became more bouncing and more trampoline-y and more like a mattress, and it got bouncier and bouncier, the more we did. It became kind of like a moon walk thing almost, but it still looked the same. And when I tried to stand the way you're supposed to stand when your stand -- feet next to each other, everything in alignment -- I just could not stand; I would keep falling down. So I had to stand with one foot in front and one foot in back a little ways. Then I could sort of stay up for a little longer, but I would still fall down. And I don't remember too much more."

It was like almost making me deaf, and it was like making my teeth rattle.  And that was kind of crazy.

Then I fell back to sleep and I dreamt that my father came up here. He drove up here and I had another week to go of vacation in my dream. And he kind of like surprised us like Uncle Bob did at the farm that one day. But it wasn't a real pleasant surprise for me because this vacation is like supposed to be us away from home, and so he drove up here, and I thought, \"Oh no, he's going to be tagging along with us the next week and he's going to rain on our parade.\" And he also saying things like, \"Well, we should drive home together when your week is up. You shouldn't have to fly home. We should all drive home together.\" And I was like, \"Oh no,\" that's the worst thing I could hear because, you see, I'm so grateful that flying gets us there in a few hours, but driving takes days on end. And it's like boring when it's just the three of us. And somehow they made it out to be more of a hassle to fly than to drive, so I dreamt that we were going to lose some morning because we didn't use our tickets, and we were going to have to drive home.

            "content": "I'm back from my trip, but I dreamt that I was still on my trip. First of all, the weirdest part, I dreamt that Elizabeth had this car that had this alarm thing that she didn't know how to shut off, or else she couldn't turn off unless she was going something like 50 or 60 miles an hour, so I think I was in Mr. Johnson's PE locker room again. I keep having dreams about stuff like back at my high school, and I don't understand it. So I was in Mr. Johnson's locker room waiting for Elizabeth to pick me up, but yet I'm still on my trip. I don't understand this notion.  And there was like this indoor race track thing that Elizabeth was going to drive by and kick me up and go. And the thing of it was, she had to go as fast as she could and I had to jump in as fast as I could so that we could get to the 50 or so miles an hour she needed to shut the alarm off. That sounds like a movie to me.  And so I'm waiting there and I don't really remember her ever, I heard the car with the alarm going on because she had to slow down a little to get into the race track thing, and I like grabbed onto the door and like jumped in and slammed the door and we raced off. And I think we were going kind of slow, but she finally got the alarm to shut off. I couldn't move around or anything. And then I dreamt that I was back in that locker room, and I had these pants, of all things, these pants that had an alarm on them.  And how it would get activated is if you would touch the end of the belt strap to the belt buckle, that would complete some kind of circuit and it wouldn't go off until you had the belt actually buckled. That was weird! Then I can't remember -- oh, I was at either Christine's house or Larry's house -- I can't remember which house. And we had all these aunties visiting us. And my father was supposed to ride up on his bike any minute, I think, and come join the visiting party. And for whatever reason, I had a portable two-way radio, not in my pocket but literally stuffed down into my pants. I don't know why, but I didn't have to be actually keying the transmitter. There was this Auntie Lovely, my mother called her, who had another one, and supposedly was listening in on everything we were saying, and I didn't actually have to be keying the transmitter to let her hear what was going on; it just transmitted by itself. And then, when we were sitting there visiting, Uncle Larry was setting up the boom box and just as he was setting it up, this Auntie Lovely lady is talking to me through the unit, and it's real, real loud, and she's saying that she's almost there and she's going to be here real soon, and not to cut the cake without her or something. And I was thinking, \"Oh gosh, how embarrassing.\" And I was hoping that they couldn't tell it was actually me. I was hoping that they could just feel that the sound was like in the air or something. So I figure, \"I have got to do something.\" So I came in and I went into the bathroom, and I was going to like turn the volume down or turn that thing off or something, but then I kind of drifted into another scene. And this scene was that my mother and I had our car to drive up in my relative's home town and I had made a CD of the blue Wee Sing tape with the \"Blue Bird\" song and everything on it. And for whatever reason, I had heard it three times earlier in the week and I wanted to play it again while we were driving around town. And so we did, and we were playing \"London Bridges\" and \"Blue Bird\" and all those other things while we were driving through town. And it wasn't scary or anything. It was just that there were other relatives in the car and I didn't want them thinking that I was a baby by wanting to play that. And I think shortly thereafter I faded into consciousness. Oh no, I didn't. There was more to it. Oh my gosh, this goes on and on and on. I'm going to use up this tape. I dreamt that after driving all around and stuff, going home to my home state was just like a bicycle ride away, and so my mother and I were going to just ride the thing home.  And we sat out there talking to Christine for another hour as if we really didn't want to go home, but we knew we had to. And it was like 11:00 o'clock at night and we were still talking. And she gave us a blanket and a sheet and a little portable boom box machine that was actually like a kids' thing that was shaped like a bunny rabbit. And my mother stuffed it in her bicycle basket and then we started bicycling home in the night. And that's -- oh, and I didn't wake up yet. I dreamt that we got home and I was squished between my mother and Mrs. Dougherty on our porch swing, and we were telling her about her trip and some of the things that happened. And that's when I woke up finally. Oh, that was just so weird.  I mean, I can't even begin to sort it out. I mean, I think, they always say that the subconscious is nowhere near as bridled as the conscious mind. I think my conscious mind is severely ridiculing my subconscious for coming up with such weird whacko ideas.  But, you know, there must be a factor going on in me somewhere that I need to pay attention to, I mean, as bizarre it may be. One other thing, I don't remember too much about the dream I was having last night, not last night but the night before when I slept downstairs on the air mattress, but I do remember, you know that thing that Mr. Romane taught us in 4th grade? It goes, \"Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?\" That was a little song that he taught us, and he wanted us to move our hands up and down according to the intervals of the notes, and that, for whatever reason, kind of scared me -- not in the dream, but in the class that he taught it to us did. And moving my hands up and down according to the notes made it feel worse because I couldn't put my hands how I normally put them when something scares me like that. And in my dream a couple nights ago I dreamt that I was in a public bathroom and they were playing that over the intercom, and it wasn't too much of a thing, but it was a little thing. And so I think half awake and half asleep, I turned over the way that I do. But I got the worst back ache and I realized that on that mattress it's not good for me to lay like that. That was crazy!"

            "content": "Okay _______ is short and sweet. Last night I had a dream that I was in this elevator with Elizabeth and a couple people from the Wilcox Center. It was really big, and had these glass windows kind of like the ones from the pier. And I had the notion that we had to get to the 14th floor of this building and we were kind of stuck, and we had to kind of ride up and down for a little while until somebody called it from the 14th floor and got it to open. And down below there were these people bouncing balls in a courtyard. We were looking through the elevator windows and we saw. And I kind of shifted to another scene that I was like with the transition people, and I had these raw cucumber slices and I like put them up against my eyes and kind of squinted to hold them there, to get kind of goofy like they do in the cartoons, because I used to do stuff like that when I was little. And they got so offended, thinking that I was making fun of myself and people who had terminal legal blindness. And I don't know where all that came from. It was small, but it was kind of crazy. So anyway, I think I did a pretty good job of filling up this tape. For once I will have timed it so that I'm done when it's done. Now I can finally take off that little piece of scotch tape that I put on the one side to let me record over this \"blah, blah, blah\" tape, and I can take the tape off and it'll just be a regular tape. Anyway, you know what I'm saying."

Well, first of all, at night I dreamt that I was walking in a park and doing some kind of stuff with my mother and my father, and I had this thing -- I don't remember what it was -- but then my thing came on to wake me and I was hearing the dove while I proceeded on with this dream of mine. And then I was still asleep and dreaming, but I felt that I was laying here in my bed. And, as I was dreaming, essentially I was asleep, but I didn't know it, so I was dreaming that my hand could reach over and change it to 104.7 like I like to hear in the morning. But since I was sleeping, I had that tactile sensation, but I really wasn't doing it, so I didn't hear any audio feedback that that was happening. And I was sleeping still. I didn't actually physically get up, but in my dream I did. I got up and I looked at it, and it was even showing me the numbers of where it was going instead of the time. But I just didn't hear it because it was still on the dove and I was still .... [end]"

This is a tape that used to be something boring that came in the mail that had a Braille label and I managed to rip it off, and I used this tape for me and ____ to goof around, as you could hear at the beginning. And so now I've got ample space left and I can't bear to just waste it, so I'm going to use it for some more dreams. I had the neatest one last night. First of all, let me start off like this, this is one of the bizarre parts. I dreamt that Celine's song, \"Prayer\" [she sings part of it] it starts off and the two verses go on just like they're supposed to, but in my dream there was no third verse and that magical key chain that she does in most of her songs. It was a car commercial in place of it. Can you believe it? And that's how I dreamt that it was recorded, and there was just nothing, it was like a big disappointment. And then I dreamt that I can't remember where I was or what I was doing -- but I was at this building -- I think it was a school or an office building or something; I can't remember what. But I needed to get on this elevator, and it was kind of a scary one because the building was twelve stories and I needed to go up to the 10th floor, so I hit #10 and we got there surprisingly fast. And I can't even remember what I was doing. Come to think of it, I think it was the Dome. I had to get up to the very top to do something with the sound board or something. And so I was at #10 and then I needed to get back down because I left my papers with the receptionist. And I got in the elevator and I needed to go ten stories down, and I hit #10 and I didn't grab the railing, and it just started to drop rapidly. And it's one of those things where you feel like you're falling and your reflexes make you physically jump and sometimes make you wake up. Well, I didn't wake up, but I felt myself jump, and I grabbed the railing and then I was okay, but it was like, \"Ahhhhh,\" free-fall. And that was really scary because I could feel myself getting closer and closer to the ceiling and then grabbed the railing and then I was okay. So I got down, and I had the feeling like the door wasn't going to open immediately, but it did. And you know what was fascinating, there was so much more to do, but I can't remember. I let the day get away from me because I was putting this off."

            "content": "We'd just come home from our trip and last night I had a bizarre dream. I was in a bunk bed, if that had any effect on anything. First of all, I dreamt that I had to retake my AP test, and it wasn't the Spanish test; it was more of a test of the usage of English grammar and spelling, but mainly on what words had certain implications. And for some reason I had the notion that that test brought on a lot of feelings of pain and sadness and fear and all like that in me because in my dream I had the notion that I took the test a few years ago and I think I missed a question or two or three, and somebody who was giving the test wanted to give me a chance to redo it. And it was on a pink sheet of paper, but I had to put my new answers on the white sheet, just these three questions. And on the pink sheet were a couple of multiple choice questions at the top. Then, you know how Spanish verb conjugations have six lines going vertically down? Well, on these six lines, there were three sets of six lines, and on the first set of six lines I had to write, \"Oh, do you know the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man, the Muffin Man? Oh do you know the Muffin May that lives on Dreary Lane?\" And on the next set of lines I had to write, \"Oh yes, I know the Muffin Man,\" and on and on. And on the last set I had to write, \"Now we all know the Muffin Man.\" And I think there were one or two other things like that, and I had the notion that you were supposed to spell \"do\" like, \"Do you know the Muffin Man\" \"d-e-w\" and I was going to have something major wrong on the test because I didn't spell it that way, but I wasn't sure, so I left it. And I answered a few of the multiple choice questions about certain words, but they were like whacko questions. I can't remember them exactly, but it asked about the odd meaning of odd words with kind of a strange implication factor. And I dreamt that I was telling somebody that having to finish that test brought back a lot of pain that I felt when I took the test that I all forgot about. And it wasn't necessarily just a fear, but it was a fear-sadness type of a thing. And I don't know what all that's about; that was weird. But somehow I felt, I woke up in the middle of the night because the air conditioner was too cold, and then I went back to sleep, and dreamt that it was Halloween and it was 5:00 o'clock in the evening. I had no candy to give out except for a little bag. I had no sound system on the porch because my mother kept putting off and putting off getting on her bike and going to get some candy from the supermarket. My father was putting off and putting off going to the garage and fixing the Peavey system. So I dreamt that not only did I have to set up the Peavey system and all its parts, but I had to set up the CD thing and the wireless mic and everything all in about ten minutes, and I was feeling really, really overwhelmed. And there were these two teenage boys already ding-donging the doorbell and trick-or-treating. And I just barely had something to give them and a few decorations out. And then that was that. I faded into another scene that I was re-recording over the lullaby tape because the last song had accompaniment but no words. And I dreamt that I could just put the tape in and hit \"record\" and the recorder would automatically mix the new increment signal with the old. And it was a song that goes, [singing] \"Golden slumber then you'll rise, ________ away to ________. Sleep pretty baby, do not cry, and I will sing a lullaby.\" But anyway, I was re-recording that and then I faded into consciousness. I sort of had the notion that I had really don that, and I was realizing that I should have first copied the tape sound track accompaniment onto a CD RW, then mixed it with my mixer with my voice and recorded that mix onto the tape, not just the voice. And somehow I had the notion that that was all correlated, and the taking the test thing really had an impact on me. I mean, I didn't really feel it, but I sort of did. And I wondered have I taken any tests lately that have had some subtle implications that have blocked some subconscious things on, or what's the deal here? So that's that. I'm using up tape like crazy, I'm sure."

I'm usually at Gate 1, but this time I was on the side that has the sound booth, that was like about Gate 4, and it was kind of scary, not in the \"whoo\" fear sense, but in the sense that orientatively scared, and that I was like at this concession stand and I had to go up, but for a minute I was perched at the very tippy top, the absolutely toppest seat that you can have in the actual ball field area. I think it was the 5th or 6th floor, and there was a railing and I was looking down. And it's not very often that I'm afraid of heights because I look down, but that time I looked down and I was like, \"How the heck did I get up here?\" And I was thinking how somehow the gates were going to open in five minutes, and the equipment was supposed to be set up around Gate 1, and I had to get there in five minutes, and I was at this tippy top seat. And I didn't have any CD's with me, and I was trying to think of some excuse how to get them to lend me some of theirs. Like, for example, that I didn't know I was supposed to be here today or something dumb like that. And before I could even do any of this, I woke up."

Anyway, I had a kind of a blah dream last night. I dreamt that, for whatever reason, my father had this mission to do somewhere up in the middle of the state. I think it was a medical thing. And he was going to leave -- I think it was Thursday -- and he was going to leave in the middle of the night and he was going to be gone Friday, Saturday and Sunday and he was going to be coming home sometime on Monday night. And while he was gone my mother and I and everybody -- it was kind of understood that my mother and I were going to go up to my tech school by ourselves and have a tour there. And get this -- Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were going to meet us there.  And we were all going to come home and have a big house party at home. And I think they were going to hang around for the week, but I can't remember. They might have been going to be gone by the time we got home, I can't remember. But it was some party that we were really looking forward to. And so I think it was that he left in the middle of the night, and then it was the next day, and early Friday morning he was home. And for some reason, I can't remember why, the trip for us to my tech school was off, and we communicated to Sheryl, Sandra and Sam that they should come meet us down in my home town instead. And they weren't supposed to get here until Saturday afternoon. Well, you know, my father has to be thinking about every single thing. He was starting to do a lot of that around the house, and I was thinking, \"Why the heck are you home so soon anyway?\" And I couldn't wait for Sheryl, Sandra and Sam to get here, but I woke up before they did. And also in this dream, again before any of this happened, I dreamt that we were watching this spoof on the Mermaid movie, and there was this part to it that I never saw before. It was like telling some of the historical aspects of some of the characters that I never knew, like I guess some of Eric's friends. And Eric's friends were Arabic, and I dreamt that Eric was Arabic like Aladdin is. I guess the media is taking over. And I guess the movie showed the history of it. Wait, I think it's going to flip. No, it's not, I've got a ways yet. Anyway, it showed the history of Eric's background, which I'd never seen before, and I think there was one brief scene in the movie where King Triton was eating French soup or spaghetti or something.  That was odd! Now I know there was something else to this, but I can't remember what it was. Oh, I know, during all the nit-picking and stuff, I was on the phone with Jane, and she had a lower voice, and she had matured a little more, and she talked about things that were more diversified and she was a little more pleasant to talk to. And I guess that's that. I guess it came from the fact that my mother and my father are going to take this defensive driving course to kind of lower their insurance rates, and it's four hours each day on two days, and it was on a Monday and a Tuesday, are the two days that they're going. And, you know, I get a ____ for them Tuesday and Thursday, so, of course, I wish they'd go on a Monday and Wednesday, but it's not given on Wednesdays. Oh well."

But maybe not; maybe I'll do alright. I dreamt that I was having this vision that when my father was a little boy he was afraid of the same sounds that I am, and that they affected him the same way. And I was having a vision that if a nice person were there to help him through it, it would have been a lot better for him. And the chords of C, E and G, the interval that would get me, is from G to E descending, or any chord for that matter from the top to the middle, top to the middle, top to the middle like, \"Ding [higher], ding [lower], ding [higher], ding [lower].\" And I guess in this dream I had a vision of somebody doing that on a keyboard and Jimmy's three years old crying, and that was weird. And then I kind of jumped over to another vision, that my mother had these candles. And they were candles, okay? Candles do not make sounds.  There were these candles and they had different sounds, but there were three of them and they were called C-E-G candles because when you would light them, they would produce the chord of C, E and G over the sound system, along with a bunch of other crazy sounds. And this is bizarre. And my mother wanted to try them out with the sound system like at top volume. And it wasn't going to be a scary thing; it was just going to be a thing. And when she lit the candles, it was like -- you know how 1930s and 40's jazz was like, [musical sounds] -- well, it was kind of like that, it was like the funny jazz that we can't stand. And I guess that was the extent of it and then I woke up. I think the candles came in because my mother got some candles from Clark and Marylou. And they were just smelly candles; I can't imagine where I would get the thought that they would make sounds. Anyway, that's that."

But anyway, the reason why I tape these is because I just think they're so fascinating, and it's so fascinating how we come up with these things that we don't even know we're thinking about consciously. And, I don't know, it's almost hallucinating almost.  Sometimes I've wondered what it's like to hallucinate when people get high and all, do they see things and hear things like dreams that have previously sat and grown in the subconscious and matured there and turned into something whacko or something. Or do they just see random things that don't have any connection with them at all? Anyway, that's another thought to ponder for another day. Last night I dreamt that we were -- Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town again, and we were watching a video for my 18th birthday party, which I sort of remember attending simultaneously. It was like we started watching the video and suddenly I was there, that kind of thing. I remember it was just like my graduation party except it was like a year after, only this is not really what my 18th birthday was like; this is how I dreamt it was like. We were at the Orange Blossom and I focused in on this crystal chandelier that was like, \"Whoo hoo, _________,\" because I had seen some crystal chandeliers in the ____ing catalog at the ramp (?) place. And somebody was sneaking in to do something, it was Sandra I think. Well, then I was like there at the party, and, you know, dancing and partying and stuff. And of all things, Sandra had Digital Performer on her laptop and she was like -- what should I say? -- recording and mixing the sound right there, kind of like what Dr. Moran was doing with Cake Walk in class -- no wonder!  I can't remember anything about what she was doing, but then the next thing I knew, we were in my studio and she wanted to transfer the tracks to my desktop so that I could work with them, and I did a lot of hokus pokus last ____ and stuff and she said that my task ____ board can do a lot more than what I usually use it for. And what it is, in reality, is that it takes a_____ audio, turns it into digital, sends it down a USB and __________ because digital audio from a USB converts it to, it's like an external sound card almost. That's why I don't need an internal one. And it also had faders and a couple other controls on it that you can move tactilely and it'll send mini messages to the real faders to move. And Da_____ ______ thought that that feature would be great for me because I'm more tactile than visual, but I found that it was a lot easier just to go to the mixer page and look at one channel at a time and move the faders there because the task scan doesn't have the automatically _______ faders which is clicked in the position when you open up the program like some do. It doesn't move automatically as you move the faders on the screen; it has to synchronize them. And that is a real pain, trust me. And but so Sandra was doing all these things ________, but like ______ teachers that don't help teach me and __________ haven't discovered it. She was doing it right from there, in my dream, of course. And I said, \"Wow, I should be able to do that too.\"  And let's see, then here comes the most bizarre part. I was in this supermarket with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam, and we were like tasting candy. There was this one mix of candy called Amazing Grace that had like white chocolate balls and different stuff, but I had this plastic sign banana thing with a picture of a wave form on it, and it was represented as of the audio from the Wave Form editor. And I was down in this big center area, court like type thing in the supermarket with all kinds of people walking around. I was sitting there moving my finger along this sign banner, trying to highlight and edit the wave form. Now talk about bizarre. And I think shortly thereafter I woke up. You know, sometimes when I sit there doing all that editing, I say to myself, \"I'm going to be seeing wave forms in my dreams.\""

And I can't remember, but she told me that she had really changed. And I had a vision of kind of in this dream, I kind of had a vision of the scene that my mother was telling me about. It was like a vision within a dream, of Mrs. Dougherty standing out in the hallway in front of the little theater at my high school kind of crying and feeling really dejected, and saying through her tears how she was just totally so disappointed with all her students and totally jaded by all of them. And she decided that teaching high school music just wasn't for her, and she was going to have to find some other profession, but it was in a really boring field she didn't really like. And I don't know why, whether it was for a nervous breakdown or for something unrelated or what, but she was in the hospital.

And I had this thank you card that I wanted to give her from graduation, which I really do; it's sitting on my desk. But in my dream I was going to give it to her when my mother brought me over there. And I started out at my college in the morning, and instead of being in my class, my first class was in this bedroom and the guy was like 18 and he was a black guy and he was an instructor. I had a feeling it was Lorenzo from the electronics class. And it was me and him and four other boys that were going to be in his class that was taught in his bedroom.  And he and the guys left, and I just kind of sat there bored for like half an hour, drawing and writing, and he came back and I said, \"Okay, I'm ready.\" And he just said this silly little poem to us and then it was time for us to go to lunch. And I stood out where I usually wait for the cab, but in my dream I was waiting for my mother. And then I woke up. I think this came from the fact that Mrs. Dougherty called my mother and wants her to help hem dresses, and I want to give her that thank you card, and I'm kind of worried about how she's doing this year. I know her kids seemed better last year, and I hope they're better this year. Anyway, that's that."

            "content": "I had a dream that consisted of a lot of different components and scenes last night, so I'll try to remember what I can. There's no guarantee it'll be in any kind of order, but oh well. First of all I dreamt that we rented the Coliseum. I'm not sure if we rented the Coliseum or if we were just going to a dance that was held there. But we had the Coliseum, we were there, and it was going to be this Christineentine's Dance with this band, Tommy and the Fiends (?), I think, or something similar. And some of the fireman people and different friends of ours were going to be there. And I dreamt that, for whatever reason, we were riding our bikes over, so we wore our sloppy clothes over and we were going to change into our dresses when we got there. And I was going to wear my nice red dress and some nice jewelry, and my mother was going to wear her Franny dress. And you know what? I had the notion that this was a Valentine's and a Halloween Dance -- is that bizarre or what? Well, so anyway, we got over there and my mother forgot the dresses, so she had to go all the way back home and I was sitting in the Coliseum lobby and my father should meet me there. And I think I was there before him. And I had the notion that all of our friends were there too, but I didn't know who they were. And somebody up at the desk suggested that they all watch Brave Heart while they were waiting, and it was like a pay per view movie, and anybody who wanted to watch the movie had to pay. But they said, \"If you want to watch the movie, show me by looking at the TV. If you don't want to watch the movie, look over at that thing on the wall over there.\" And, of course, I was just looking down the whole time, so I think it was obvious that I didn't want to watch the movie, but I wasn't sure. And so then all of a sudden I think I was in school and I was waiting for them to bring the costumes in school. And I was in Dr. Moran's lab and I had the notion that I had written a report in there and I had to print something, like my mother brought the first three pages of my report but she forgot the fourth one, so I had to go in and I had to print my fourth one. And that was successful. And also, then after I printed my fourth report page, I went to Cake Walk, even though it looked totally different than what I'm used to it looking like in real life, and I dreamt that I had, I was mixing like a scene from the Little Mermaid, and I had too many tracks and an audio track, and I don't remember what was in them except it was the Ursula scene. And I had to mix down the two MIDI tracks into audio track, then I had to mix the two audio tracks down into one, so I had to do a lot of complicated maneuvers in order to do this, and in my dream I had a nice big cursor that I could follow fast, and I didn't have this \"when you flow\" factor like I do in school. And then as I was doing all this, a girl came on next to me and said something like, \"Hey, what are you doing?\" And she kind of distracted me, and I think -- I can't remember -- but then the scene like suddenly changed and I was back at the Coliseum, but I was outside like on a beach, and I dreamt that now my father wanted us to wait for him on this beach, and he was coming with my mother with the dresses after a while. And they were having a little party on this beach, and I was sitting under a little umbrella so that I wouldn't get burned by the sun, and I was sitting on this like lawn chair that was like a couch almost. So I put my feet up and was laying back, and there were other people milling around getting like food and c_____s and stuff, and I had this small radio, about the size of my tape machine, maybe a little bigger, and it had an antenna that was kind of standing up, and it was on, but it was kind of quiet, and I was concerned about when people go by, was it going to be really odd or what?  You know, like ________. And I was laying there, like, \"Dee dee, la dee dah,\" taking it all in, and then I woke up. I never did get to the Coliseum dance."

But today, I'm doing my research paper on dreams, and today I was reading a book and it was talking about all this stuff involved with dreams and what happens when you dream and stuff. And the only thing that was coming to me from my frame of reference was this stupid dream, so I figured there's got to be something to it, so I guess I'm going to go ahead and put it down here. I dreamt that we were in our living room. It was my mother, my father and I think Christine and Bill were in town, and we were sitting around talking about different things. And I was sitting on the floor and everybody else was sitting on like the couch. And then it was my mother and me and some guy -- I don't know who -- and my mother had these candy-coated almond nut things that were kind of real rough and like big, and this is the bizarre part. My mother wanted me to, I think she was going to do some and she wanted me to do some. She wanted us to smooth them out and make them smaller, and the way to do it was to put them on the bed in front of us and to like lay on the bed and like self-satisfy ourselves. And I saw my mother do that with the ________s and they went from these big pecans or almonds to these small, really sweet candies. And, you know, I don't remember too much more. There had to be more though."

            "content": "Last night I had kind of an interesting dream. It wasn't all that odd, but I wish I would quit having dreams about programs I used to mix sound. I mean, it's getting a little crazy now.  I'm not really sure which of these scenes came first, but I think this is the first one. I was -- how come I can't talk this morning? Okay, I think I'm ready. I was at this -- no, wait -- first I was at the house and my Mac machine was on the front porch. In place of the white bench there was a little table where I was sitting and working. And I was working on some part of DP all visually because the rest of my system was all upstairs, but for some reason that was there, I guess because in my dream my father figured we could both work side by side, because he would be in the foyer and I would be out there. But the rest of my system wasn't there with it, and I was thinking, \"How in the world am I going to be able to get this back to my studio where my audio system is. Even my task scan was still up here. And just about that point I was deleting a few sound bites, and I was working on something in DP, and Mary Jo and Ken's mother and their family were inside. I don't know how they got there; they didn't walk past me from the front door. And I think Elizabeth was there too. And it was like a post-graduation. We didn't get to come to the party, so let's have the party at your house kind of party, even though in real life they did come to graduation. And so I got up from my work for a minute and head into the kitchen to go say hi and then come back and shut down. But before I knew it, I was dancing with them, I was partying with them, I was opening presents with them. And it was dark by the time the party was like in full swing, and I realized I didn't get to shut down. And my father said, \"Don't worry, I shut down for you already.\" And that was that. And then out of the group of people that was there, there was this one black girl, and her name was Arkisha, and my father was talking on the phone to a Geico agent named Arkisha before. But this girl Arkisha was about my age and she wanted to go to my college with me, and she said that she had these friends that were in this Spanish band that were doing some kind of recording test in Dr. Moran's lab, and it was like they're weren't testing out the equipment. The test was on them to see how well they knew how to use the equipment. And Arkisha thought that I knew a lot and wanted me and this other boy to come and help them because they needed assistance. And so in my dream my college was like just a walk away, like up on 7th Street, and it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk over there. So we walked over there and I was barefoot, and I had like real sloppy clothes on, and we were walking around the school. And in my dream it was neat to feel the surfaces of the floor and stuff with my bare feet. And we went into Dr. Moran's lab, and it was bigger and it had a blue floor. And there was this little area off to the side where people let bands go when they have to record, which there really isn't. It was like an enclosed glass area with a stage and a sound board. And we were in there and Dr. Moran said that I couldn't help those boys because I knew too much and that I wasn't going to be just a hand, I was going to be wanting to tell them lots of information for their test. And so I was going to go home, and so I was walking out and walking home and again, it was more trouble to wait for the cab than to just walk home because I only had to go like two blocks. And then before I got home, I kind of started waking up, and then I realized where it really was and that it really was too far to walk. And then I kind of faded into consciousness."

They kind of said that they were looking at us and that, I don't know, one guy was kind of real sarcastic and said, \"I made __________ over there.\" And then they got a little more serious and said like, \"Well, you guys just ought to keep your pants on,\" or something like that. When we were out in the back yard and my father wanted me to carry pepper spray when I go places, and I said, \"There's got to be a better way to defend myself.\" And, I don't know, he said something crazy like, \"You'll scream and you'll get maimed and killed.\" And I think that I woke up."

I dreamt that we were going camping with Gary and Polly on a Sunday up to, I think it was something like Goldhead State Park, or something like that. And Astrid, when the dream took place, it was like a Wednesday, it was like a few days before camping, Astrid was over and, well, I think even before Astrid got there, my father was being a little crabby like he gets some times, and Astrid shows up and then Gary and Polly show up. And I'm thinking, \"Oh good, we might be able to go a little early,\" and, of course, a lot of people to be with, so things will be under control. And I think Gary and Polly came into my bedroom and I was like half naked, and I got a top and I put on a top, and I had to go pee and do a bunch of other things. And little did I know, but Astrid was sitting around bored most of that time. And I came into the living room and she was telling Gary and Polly, \"Twice now this has happened. She asked me over and got totally distracted,\" something like that. And I came and sat down next to her. She was still talking as I was walking up because she didn't now I was coming. And then I sat down and I took her hand and I talked to her to let her know I was there. And she moved her hand against my shoulder, which she's never done before in real life, and I was like, \"I'm sorry, I just had a lot of cleaning to do and stuff.\" And then when she was, a little while later, she leaned up and kind of kissed me on the cheek.  And then, here comes the really bizarre part. I dreamt that this camping trip -- well, not just for this camping trip -- it had been done before, to have my whole system and everything piled into the back of the car, have the back seat taken out replaced with my desk and all my equipment. And I think I was counting on this setup for this trip because it was going to be quite a drive and I had some work to do for, I think for Dr. Moran, but I'm not sure who. And I can't remember what in the world I was working on, but it was some kind of sequence. I kind of was thinking at that point that I would have access to the thing at school before I left , and I could do some of it there. And then suddenly in the course of all this, the scene shifted and I was at Dr. Moran's lab, except it was a huge room, and there were 40 or 50 work stations, kind of like in the commons on the second floor of the Business Tech Building that people were telling me about. Well, this place was like that except the work stations were like I'm used to working at. And somebody, like two or three work stations down from me, wanted to put a picture of Santa Claus on their desktop, and actually it was a picture of her uncle dressed as Santa Claus.  And I heard somebody warning the person, like the Santa Claus picture that she had might have a virus in it, but nobody seemed to really concede. And then next thing I knew, everybody had Santa Clauses on their desktops because, I guess in that situation, it would be like a network and I guess what would happen to one would happen to all of them. But I had a Santa Claus on my desktop, but I wanted to get rid of it because I wanted the picture that I had before which I can't remember what it was. I didn't have a picture in real life, but in my dream I was used to having a picture of me in my home studio, I think. And so I wanted that picture back. And in the a process of trying to get rid of this Santa Claus and get my picture back, something happened, and I can't remember if it was serious or not. But it was kind of in a fog and I faded into yet another scene, that I was at home and I was listening to like the American Idol on 94.9, and it had somebody doing their version of Celine's \"On the Line\" and it sounded darned close, but it wasn't. And then they were doing like other people's versions of other songs. I can't remember exactly what they were. And then I woke up."

I don't know if it was a chorus of singers or a dance group, or just a group of friends, but it was some kind of group. And I had a notion that we were either going to perform or have some kind of fun that looked like performing. But we were at this big hall, like the Front Center, and there was an ice rink, and I wanted to get on the ice rink so that I could dance and ice skate with the others. But there were these, all these things around the perimeter, like cover things or grate things that I was afraid of and I was afraid of stepping on. And I was bare foot and I was trying to navigate between them, and more of them kept popping up, and so I had to just back out and not go near the ice rink. And I know there were more scenes, but this is what I get for waiting this late in the day. I don't remember any more."

            "content": "Well, I guess you could say I had three dreams last night because it spanned three different areas. After all, they say we have a minimum of three dreams a night and a maximum of nine, so I guess I remember all three last night. First of all, this is kind of, we were watching -- oh, wait a minute -- I think there were even some more. I remember a fourth part to this. My goodness! Seeming you remember little parts, your imagination cues and you remember the rest. My father and my mother and me and even some other people were on this boat, and I can't remember for sure, but we were going to dock somewhere for the night, and we were going to keep going and then we were going to come back and dock in a different place for the night. And I think what it was, is we were trying to figure out where to dock. There was this docking place that was kind of old-fashioned that was built with like a porch swing and some interesting things, and a little lodge thing. And I don't remember why we chose that place, but kind of for the reason that we chose bed and breakfasts over just hotels. And let's see, I really don't remember the details, but it was something about this place where we were going to dock, kind of it was an open, it was a real live environment, like we were under water, but it wasn't; it was on top. It was like this hotel place. And so then the next scene was, is we were in this hotel place kind of sitting around, but it kind of turned into our living room, and we were watching -- or at least I was watching -- Celine's Las Vegas show on TV, and how some of the things were just so complicated. And then at the end of the show it had a feature that showed her dying of a virus that she contracted from Reyna, and that was like the worst thing. And then I think the next part of the dream was that I was in Dr. Schumann's class for Psychology and he was showing us different pictures in the book, like a baby, or a horse, or other things and asking us, \"What do you think people would think when they see this symbol?\" And the class was like totally out of it, but I was real involved and real excited about what he was talking about and everything. Then the next part was that I was in the bathroom of the Social Arts Building at my college that kind of put me in mind of the Birch Building at my high school. And there was this boy in there that, well, I just sort of knew that the alarm box in the bathroom wasn't working and this boy knew that a fuse had to be replaced, and he had the correct kind of fuse with him. And the boy wanted me to be in there with him when he was doing this because he said that I knew something about electronics that he was unsure of. He had this kind of real mamby pamby lack of self-confidence. So how it ended up was that I was sitting in the bathroom stall on the toilet, not really having to go, just sitting in there. And I heard him clinking and screwing and messing around, but I didn't see what he was doing, of course. And I was just sitting on this toilet totally terrified in fright of what was going to happen if the system sounded. And I was kind of like cowering down and something like that, and the boy assured me that when the alarm system is tested, it's only going to sound at like a quarter of the strength that it would if it was really a real incident. So believing him, I was a little at ease, but I was still real frightened of the whole thing. And [sigh], let's see, oh, when he finished and he put the thing all back together, he tested it and it was only a quarter of the intensity. In fact, I could barely hear it, and he was like, \"How do I get this thing to come on full?\" meaning the alarm system. And I was like, \"I don't know, but you could ask the maintenance people.\" And he was a nice boy. He wasn't one of these teenage sadists, so he gave me time. He said he was going to give me time to get outside and get far away from the building and all like that, and when I went out the back of the Social Arts Building, it was like the track on the PE field of my high school, and I sat down near these people that I thought I knew. I started talking to them and they said how, for degree-seeking students, how your first semester was like four general ed classes, boom, boom, boom. And that's what they took, and they said how bored they were. And I was glad I wasn't in their position. And I think that the last part of this dream was that I was back in Dr. Schumann's class, and he wasn't showing us symbols like a baby or a horse. He was showing us more serious symbols like what does it mean to speak to people, how do you think people feel when they have their eyes covered? What happens when they hear certain things? And just real in-depth things like that. And again, the class was like, \"Uh, uh, uh, uhhh....\" And I was raising my hand and wanting to talk about some of these things, and he was like looking around for the rest of the \"Uhhhhh, uhhhhh\" people and trying to enlist them into paying attention and stuff. And then I woke up.  I have a voice analysis to give about the second part of this dream, the part about being in the bathroom with that boy while he was fixing the alarm box in the bathroom. I think that, first of all in this case, the bathroom does not represent a cleansing environment. It might, but most likely it represents a live environment which would be the worst place that a person would want to be when an alarm system sounds. But what it could be is it could be a cleansing place that appears to have some kind of frightening thing to overcome in order to cleanse yourself. And, of course, the alarm system is the major element of fear in this part, and represents something majorly frightening. The boy, I tend to think, represents a higher power, because the boy really is sympathetic to my being afraid of the alarm system, but he wants me to participate in the operation that he is doing, even though he knows that I'm majorly afraid of it, because he thinks that I can contribute to it in some positive way. And he assures me that it won't be as bad as I'm making it out to be. And also he isn't, he gave me plenty of time to escape when he did want the system to sound at full capacity. So I think there's something going on here, something that needs to occur in my life that may seem frightening, but is worthwhile and I just to have to go through it.  I don't know. This is deep, man."

It was boring, so I really don't want to be back there, but I guess I keep thinking like I am. And I dreamt that I was in Mr. Johnson's class and we were lifting weights and listening to his boom box, and I had to get out of class and go take my test, but I was kind of chicken and didn't know how to ask him and he wasn't even around.

Well, after a while, she turned over and started talking to me, and I realized it was Astrid and she was kind of holding me too, just like my mother does. But for some reason she was calling herself Kendra. And we were talking about various things, like I don't think she told her Greek mythology story again, but she was thinking how, she was just chatting like people do. And, let's see, I think we got up and we were rearranging my closet, putting some clothes in order and stuff, and I was showing her my porcelain dolls and she was like changing. In life we just dress in front of each other because, first of all, she can't really see so it's not a big deal to her. And, of course, I can't either! And so it just works out both ways and we just dress right in front of each other. So that's what we did in my dream. And I had this glow worm that I was showing her and the glow worm had like a head band with a butterfly, and she was going to take the butterfly off the head band. Here's where it gets bizarre . So anyway, she wanted to take the butterfly off the head band of the glow worm and put it on a ribbon to tie around her waist -- I don't remember how and it was kind of a little scary -- but I was, for some reason she like did something really weird and I had to explain to her about a woman's body and why her private area was important to be clean and covered and all. And she seemed to understand, she seemed to be taking it like a sisterly thing. And then I woke up. And it's funny because oftentimes when I first wake up I can't remember my dream at all. And I just have to think for a while. And sometimes they come to me in the middle of the day. Most people it's just the opposite, and that's how this one worked."

I dreamt that we were going up to Be_____, my home state again, or somewhere up there, I wasn't exactly sure where it is, and we were going to stay at this rental like party house with, instead of Janice and Larry and Gary and Polly, we were going to stay with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and Christine and Bill and Josie and Bobby. And there were about two or three bedrooms on the bottom floor, like two bedrooms on the top floor, and one bedroom at the very tippy top of the third floor. And mine was up on the third floor. Mine was the top one because I had like a lot of sound equipment that I was bringing in for their party, and, come to think of it, it wouldn't make sense to put me and my equipment on the third floor. It would make sense to put us on the ground floor! But in my dream I was on the third floor and this place had an elevator, so I guess I could get it down alright. And to get there I think my mother and my father preceded me because I had one more day of classes or something. And so I was on this bus, and I had two Peavey Escort systems for some crazy reason, I had a bunch of other stuff, but I wasn't sure exactly what. And I never actually had it in my hands. I had a few people helping me get it on the bus and into this cargo bay, and then when I got there, I don't remember getting there; I just remember suddenly being there. And I don't remember too much about the party we were having, but I do remember staying there, and I sort of remember something about us being together for like a little party or something, and it was outside on the deck. I had the Peavey system out there with the wireless mic. And then we kind of all went to sleep. I had the notion that the party was on the last night that we were going to be there, so after the party I didn't take the Peavey system down and bring it back to my room or anything, I just left it set up. And we all kind of went to sleep. And I remember that night I didn't go up to my room on the third floor with some other equipment piled into my room. That night I just went to _____ and I crashed in Sheryl, Sandra and Sam's room with them. And the next morning -- you know how my father likes to leave out of the house like 4:00 o'clock in the morning if we've got to drive across the state so we can get home at like a reasonable hour? Well, that's what we did, and, of course, I don't have any brains at that hour and then I think we were in the car and halfway through coming home, I realized I forgot both of the Peavey systems and all my other equipment. I left it there. And it was really a bad thing because Halloween was right around the corner. And we called Uncle Bob on the cell phone and he said, \"No problem, we'll swing by that way on the next step on our trip. We'll bring it and drop it off for you.\" And we said, \"Okay, that would be great.\" And, let's see, oh, when we got home, Uncle Bob had sent a new bag of Halloween things for me, like some plastic rats and some spiders and two statues -- no, three or four statues of cats coming out of pumpkins and ghosts and various things and like lab (?) statues that were like about as tall as my figures now. And there was a statue of Sir Mix-a-Lot, and at the base of the figure it said, \"Baby Got Back.\"  And, of course, my mother was complaining. Oh, and there was one other thing he gave me. It was like a head, a pilgrim head on a stick with a stand. And my mother was really upset because she didn't want to store all this new Halloween stuff. And she was like totally spoiling it for me. And all this stuff was meant to be a thank you for DJ'ing their party or something like that. And then I began to fade into consciousness and I was still kind of out there, but I realized that my Peavey system is on the porch. I just handled it last night, but I was wondering if I had left the wireless mic and other stuff over there. And then when I really came to, I realized that I only have one and it's all in my closet and that was just a dream."

And I don't remember too much except I think my father wanted me to wrap it up and take it down to like the beach or something so that we could have a party out there and I could like open it for my birthday or something. And then suddenly the scene shifted, and I was in the downstairs bedroom listening to a couple CD's, and I dreamt there was a CD changer in there, which there really isn't, and it was like 6:00 o'clock in the morning when I was doing this. And my mother comes in and all of a sudden I was trying to turn it down because I'm a little embarrassed that I'm like just here. And she said, \"It's alright, it's alright,\" and something like that. She told me something else that she's going to do. She's like going to do something in the kitchen or something. So she goes in the kitchen and all of a sudden the kitchen radio in there, I had the notion that it's a CD changer also, and all of a sudden the CD that I was listening to jumps over there to her and she has to listen to it, and it was kind of a dumb one. And I can't remember anything more. I think I woke up after that. There was something else I remember about this dream now. For some reason, after my mother and I had talked, I was laying there on the bed thinking up a story."

            "content": "Last night I had a dream that, well, I remember a bunch of scenes, but I can't really tell you which ones came first. But I'll do my best at putting them in order. This is going to be another one that uses up a lot of tape, I think. First, I think, I was having lunch with Ms. Fletcher at this little strip of shops and restaurants that I had the notion was part of the my college campus or just off of it or something. We were eating there and there were some interesting places there, and I was watching the time close because I had to get up to class. And so I went over to the Fine Arts Building, which looked more like the Media Building from my high school, and I went into class. Then next day I was there with my mother and it was like evening time, and I think I had asked her to take me to a bar or take me dancing or something, since I'm 18 now. And so we were going to this little restaurant place that we thought was going to be cool, and they had this table and chairs outside with their sound system set up and this band that was playing some good stuff. And we were dancing and dancing for a while, I think, and then she's like, \"I've got to take you somewhere else for a minute, but we'll come back here, I promise.\" And she took me into this store, or some kind of place, next door in the shopping plaza thing. And it had an ivory-colored, off-white colored floor. It was almost yellow because of the lights. It was like Circuit City or something. And she was going to like boost me up on her shoulder. She used to be able to do that, but now my father's only strong enough to. But anyway, in my dream she could still boost me up on her shoulder. She's like, \"One, two, three,\" and I was like perched on her shoulder and she was showing me this shelf way up high that had like six keyboards laid out on it. And I was like, \"Wow!\" And so then she got me down and we went back dancing at that place for a while and I'm trying to think here. And I think we danced or something, or we ordered some food or something, but then the scene just sort of like changed, and I was in the Fine Arts Building, which like I said, which kind of looked like the Media Building at my high school. And I was trying to find my class, I was trying to find Dr. Moran's lab in there, and I was walking around this hall and I came across this room that I went in. It was really dark and there were three or four girls kneeling in there rehearsing this song in harmony, and I didn't know then that I didn't know the song, and I had this like furry purse with me that was black and I sort of in my head called it a mink purse. And so I didn't really know them and so I just left, and I was coming down the stairs, and the stairs were real, real narrow. There was no railing on one side, and there was a sort of a \"meh\" railing on the other side, and I was going down the stairs and I managed to get down alright, sort of. It was really steep and really narrow, like I dream about stairwells being sometimes. It wasn't dark and scary like they are sometimes, it was just hard for me to navigate, especially with the purse that turned into my book bag in the other hand. And I got down and my mother -- I can't remember if it was my mother, I think it was my mother -- picked me up in the truck, and we were going to the park. And when we got to one intersection there were like, I couldn't see them but she told me they were there -- there were like two fire trucks, a rescue truck, and a ladder truck, I think -- four trucks all together. And I kind of felt like maybe my father was in one of them and they were going to a call. And they were all running their lights and sirens. How it would work was they would only run their lights and sirens when they were moving, so when they stopped at a red light, they wouldn't run them. And so it seemed that they would always be an intersection ahead of us, and when we would catch up to them and stop at their intersection, we would all go at the same time. And then when their lights and sirens would race past us and I would hear them real loud for minutes and then they'd be like past us. And then they would wait at the next intersection until we got there, and they wouldn't go until we got there. And then they ran their lights and sirens real loud in our faces again. And they did that like three times and I was like terrified when we got to the park. But fortunately, when we got to the park, they turned down another street and were gone. And then I woke up."

Well, let's see, oh, first of all, I dreamt that, well, first of all in real life, there's a substitute teacher that comes in to electronics class when Mr. Martin is out, his name is James Hill. In my dream James Hill didn't think I was doing up-to-par work, and I was going to write this paper to prove what I knew and I was going to hurry up and write it long-hand before the bus came in the morning. And I can't remember what we were talking about, but my father and were laying on the bed talking and talking and talking and before I knew it, all my time was gone and I didn't get to write the paper. And then -- this is the crazy part -- there was this candy bar, actually on all the Phi Beta Kappa candy bars I had the notion that they would look interesting if we drew some kind of picture with like frosting. And I seem to recall the wrapper having that kind of picture, and before I knew it some kid ran up on the porch and offered me three treats out of his Halloween pumpkin if he could give me back one of the candy bars he bought from me, and that was cool. And I used that one, and I could have sworn the wrapper was going to have some picture on it for us to draw from, but it didn't. And I was saying how, if I had the time, I would be creative and I would draw little things in each square, but I didn't have that kind of time. And I can't remember why I put it . We were eating pizza for breakfast, the leftovers of Brittany's pizza, and I think I remember something else, just before I woke up and my father was walking out the door, he said something like, \"But I'm not sure, but you guys just hate it!\" And then I woke up."

I dreamt that we were supposed to meet Grandma and Grandpa at this little restaurant, kind of like the days when we used to meet them at Ruby's all the time. Then it got to where we would drive over to Ruby's, then it got to the point they didn't really want to go out that much any more. But it used to be we would meet them at Ruby's. Well, I dreamt that we were doing something like that, except it was like this little restaurant like Chucky Cheese, and there was this set of tables that had reserved that the waitress brought us to that had -- what should I say -- this little circle of, it was like a choo choo train merry-go-around thing and had these seats that people sat in that represented little animals, like there was a -- they didn't really look like the animals to the sight that I had, but I sort of had the notion and the waitress told me that they were animals. One was supposed to be a sheep, one was supposed to be a lion, and I can't remember what the others were. And they called it the Ziggety Zoo suite or something stupid like that. And, let's see, I think I started riding in the sheep one, even though it was just sort of like a rocking chair with twirly whirls on the back, and it would go round and round and round and tipsing and over and upside down, and it dumped me out and I fell on the floor. And I think about that time Grandma and Grandpa came into the restaurant and my eyes were like closed. I could see darkness, I was coming into stage 1 sleep, but I sort of felt like they had the notion that I had fallen and I couldn't get up. And I was laughing hysterically still in my dream. And my mother was like, \"She's asleep, she's asleep,\" on the floor there, and then I just kind of woke up."

So we were staying in these like three or four level house unit things, like we were exploring across the street from the park on 5th Street and I saw that it was becoming daylight by the time I got out there. And Carl and Arlene had one and they were sitting out on their front porch. But I couldn't find the one for my mother and my father and there were a lot of them that didn't look like anything. So then I was just trying to run back and find mine and I couldn't. I couldn't find -- there were like ten of these things in a row and I couldn't find mine. And then I sort of woke up."

Then I realized Allison turned into Terri and she was taking pictures of us naked, just as normal as anything, in this like bare garage area. And I had to go home and get another set piece, and I ran back and I set up, and they didn't need it after all. They were just going to take pictures of us on the couch. And that's all, I think."

Oh, I know, she was going to go see her art, and afterwards we were going to do something together. And I was kind of being babysat at a fire station while she was going to look at her art. And they were doing something inside like a show thing and I got to go in and see it. And I was worried about them doing their sirens and this and that, but they said they weren't going to do that for some reason. While I was outside talking to a lady in the back, I heard three sirens, one each had two tones at different intervals, and I told her the intervals that I didn't mind. It was one broader than the usual. I don't know, but it was broader than the one that gives me nerves. So then we went inside and we got to see this show. It was kind of dark and we were all like sitting on the floor. This was this girl, she was playing taps on like a huge bugle thing, and then she had a keyboard that she was playing some jazz on, and apparently she got her right and left hands mixed up because her mother kept saying, \"Wrong arm, wrong arm,\" or something like that.  And then there was this Indian dance that was like shaking shaker things or something. Then suddenly I was with my mother again, and we were going off to, we were going to find someplace to dance and have fun because it was a Friday night, and I don't know if we ever found a place or not. I seem to remember looking at a menu at this bar place, but it's all I can remember."

She was just getting herself together. And I didn't really know if I was supposed to be her DJ sound person for her reception or not, and I was going to go over to her and ask her and say, \"Hey, what about your reception?\" because I had to know whether I should pack up the Peavey system or not. And I don't remember what she told me; I think she said, \"I'm still not sure.\" So that's pretty unsure. And so I packed everything up, just in case, and I think we were in the truck going down there, and Sam was driving, and I was there and there was somebody else, I think it was Mickey in a black dress, and all the other people on a different vehicle. And then I kind of woke up. I didn't think this was important enough to put on here, but then I realized that maybe it is because it kept coming back to me all day today. And I think it came from listening to the graduation footage and all the commotion that was going on in our house that we'd been hearing all their voices again, and thinking about when they were in town and all like that.

First I dreamt that me and Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and a couple other people were staying in this house, like a bed and breakfast, except the owner wasn't there. It was just the place was all to ourselves. And we were doing a bunch of things, I can't remember what, and it was our last night there and somebody warned me that they were going to have to do a fire drill just because it was in the protocol that they had to do it, but that none of us had to be there when they did it because they just had to test the alarm system. So I was getting dressed and I was getting my clothes on really fast, hoping that I could get out there before they actually did it. So I was getting dressed and I grabbed my bags and I slipped my shoes on and I went outside. And I put my bags by the truck, and I started walking down the alley a little ways so that I could be further away from the building, I guess. And I was just standing, when I thought I was far enough away. Well, Sheryl, she comes out and she has this red thing in her hand. I guess I thought it was one of the sound emitters from the building , and she had it in her hand, and I start running, and she says, \"Oh, smart girl!\" And she catches up to me and she stuffs this thing in my back pocket, and I rip it out and I throw it and I keep running. And she grabs it and she runs after me, and she comes near me with it again, and I ran some more until I was far enough away and then I stopped. And then I dreamt that I was in class. I didn't know if it was Business Law class or one of my new classes for next semester, but I was in class and they were doing busy book work in class, which is very rare, and I was doing mine and I was looking at something that I wrote. I mean, I was looking, I had this paper and it was, it had a big design on the top of an Indian holding a bow and arrow, and I was looking at something that I had printed on it from my machine upstairs here, like I had a printer. And I printed right over the top of this bow and arrow picture, and it was a big, like half a page, picture. And it was something very personal. It was a journal entry about the thing in the last scene about staying in the picture, running away from Sheryl. And then I was like in the kitchen with my mother, and I was standing up on this -- oh, wait -- after the bow and arrow paper thing, some girl kind of got a little faint and leaned on my desk, and the teacher came to the other side of my desk and was trying to support her. And I got like smashed in between them so that I could hardly breathe. I was feeling very faint, and I couldn't duck my head and get out from under them or between them or anything. And I can't remember any more."

I dreamt that my mother and I were going to go on this Halloween party boat and we had tickets and she had bought them for $4.99 somewhere. And we were going to kind of slip out because the party went from like 9:00 until like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, so we were going to slip out after he went to bed, and we were going to go. And she was sleeping in my bed here, which really she wasn't, but in my dream she was. And we were talking about, actually I think we were laying on the floor and we were talking about how we were going to go, we were going to go and keep sneaking up behind us. And then I go downstairs and he sees how, I think he heard a lot of what we were conspiring to do. And he picks me up and he holds me and he feels really sorry that -- what should I say? -- I guess that he'd made the image that he had, and something else like that. And I just come out and tell him that my mother and I had these tickets to this party.  And the party was supposed to be on a boat, and they were like for, they for cheap, and that we were going to go. So we go, and, of course, I was expecting like a big boat and a band and a show and a party and stuff. But this was like, you know at an airport there's a long hall that connects to the plane? Well, in this situation there was a building that was an art gallery, and there was a long hallway corridor that was leading to this square room, and there was a gray rug, and it was supposed to be the boat. This square room with a gray rug was supposed to be a boat, this big party boat that everybody was talking about. So I knew -- and even though it was supposed to happen at night, it was light outside, and the only seats were the ones that we were in. And I get on first because I'm afraid that we're going to be late, and my mother is there looking at pictures and she says she'll be meeting me. And who comes on and joins me, but my father instead. He like takes her place. And, let's see, so we start sailing, and it's like, they like do something, seal off the engines like they do on a plane, and we kind of shove off from the building with this square room, sailing through the water. Maybe this is because all I see of the plane area is a square cabin, but anyway, pretty soon, when we're sailing, the floor goes away, the glass in seals it goes away, they put some, that orange construction fence around and a board for the roof and just a seat and that's all. And then it stops and we're like swinging around inside of it, there's like water in it, and really not a party at all. But my father had me dive to the bottom and show me where there some connection made underwater for the sound system, I think, which I don't know why that would be, if there's no sound and no party. But anyway, let's see, I think we go past a beach and my mother just kind of swims out from the beach and comes and joins us. And then I kind of woke up. That was really a bummer because I was expecting to go on this party, but it wasn't. It was just a dumb little ocean cruise thing. I think this comes from the fact that Rib Fest (?) was last year and she and I went to see Swarner (?) and we had a great time. And this year BTO was playing last night, but it was their TV night. That and Third Watch was on. And tonight is CreAnthonyce Clearwater Revival and Astrid's coming, but if she doesn't come for whatever reason, we can go, I think. So that's that."

Well, first of all, I don't know if I was back at my high school or still at my college, but I had some classes to go to, and I was oftentimes I would go like to the bathroom in between classes. Well, in this one class that I was in, I met the teacher and she said that I really needed to not be late so much because I was getting behind in material. And, oh, this is so weird -- this class was a PE/ Music class. We were going to be like singing, but she said we had to get stronger by doing things like sit-ups and lifting weights and stuff. And so we would do a combination that, and I think there were like no more desks and I was like standing in the back of the room, and she was teaching us about theory, and she was showing how chromatic scales are a lot easier to play, but major scales sound better and more complete. And I'm trying to think, I don't remember the examples she gave. This room was like kind of small, but there were like, I don't know, two or three rows with people in front of where I was standing, if that means anything. And this teacher was like a nice woman, she was wearing jeans, I think. And I don't think Mrs. Dougherty ever wore jeans, and I don't think Mrs. Hager did either, but she seemed like jeans was like something about her personality that she was more like Mrs. Hager, more casual and what have you. But suddenly the scene like shifted, and I was at home and I was fixing some kind of lunch for myself, and I hear this funny sound in the living room and I can't figure out what it is. And my mother said that she had borrowed and brought home a Yamaha Clavinova, not from Dr. Moran's lab, but from this teacher. And she said that the teacher had told her that I was kind of like, kind of bashful about touching it, and she wanted my mother to work with me with it. And let's see, the thing of it was, when you would walk towards it, it would make this funny buzzing sound, like when you first, I don't know, a feedback loop in the lower frequency range, I guess you could say. But it didn't do that at home, I don't know why, so I saw it in the living room and my mother was trying to convince me to sit down in front of it, and it started shrinking and shrinking and shrinking, and before I knew it, it was the size of something for a Barbie doll. And then I woke up. Well, wait a minute, one other crazy twist I remember about this dream: when it was shrinking and shrinking, my mother like took a piece off of it, and I realized that it was chocolate with like vanilla frosting, and that it really wouldn't make any sound if I were to touch it and try to carry a tune. So she cut off a piece of the chocolate from the edge and I had a bowl of ice cream and she just threw this piece of chocolate in my bowl of ice cream. And I really didn't want to finish my ice cream, but I woke up before I could."

At first I wasn't going to record it, but then I realized if I'm going to be true to myself while I'm doing all this psychoanalysis, I have to record it. I can't just portray myself favorably like human nature says we do, because then I'd be calling the kettle black, trying to figure out everybody else's mishaps. So no matter how embarrassing it might be at times, I'm going to try to tell all that comes into my life. I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town, and they were kind of planning something for me for Christmas, and come to think of it, we were planning surprises for each other for Christmas. And we had just come back from some beach thing. I think we were coming back from a long walk on the beach that was nice, and we were all riding in this van - Sheryl and Sandra and Sam, Nikki and me. And my mother and my father were there. I sort of like had the notion that they were there because I heard them talk, but some driver was driving us around, like one of my cab drivers. And we were talking about various things, I can't remember what exactly. But my father was asking me questions like, apparently in my dream he had heard my CD that I had burned from Music and Computers class, which I really haven't burned it yet, and he was asking me questions like, \"How did you do all this stuff?\" and \"Do you know how to play any songs?\" and this and that and the other. And the van driver stopped and we all got out, and we went into this place that was kind of like the foyer area of the Rattison Hotel that we go to for awards and ceremonies sometimes, except this place was carpeted, and it was big and spacious. But I didn't know exactly where we were, but it was someplace fancy and elegant. I kind of had the notion that it was a furniture store because there were couches and chairs and tables and stuff spaced out all over everywhere. And I think there was a staircase off to the side, and it was kind of brownish carpeting. And my father had me -- think it was Lee, I don't know if it was Lee or my father -- but one of them had me sit down at this keyboard, like the model we have in school, and play \"Joy to the World.\" And I put my hand at the top of the middle C octave, but as I was descending down the scale, like you do in the first line, I realized that the thing was like up sideways and I like, I don't know how to explain it, but it was like instead of horizontal, it was almost vertical. It was kind of like at an angle almost. And after you got down to G, the C octave just kind of disappeared and you had to take your thumb and go along the side of the unit with these \"dup dup dup dup\" things on the side, these little rounded keys after G. F, E, D, C were on the side; they were little rounded things. And it got more and more horizontal and more and more horizontal, and then I realized it was all white, but amazingly enough I was able to play this song perfectly. And my father was pretty amazed, and he said, \"You have to have one for Christmas.\" And he said that this model that we were sitting near was kind of an old-fashioned type of model, and he was in search of one that was, I don't know, like a few generations up, I guess you could say, you know how units are. But somehow I wasn't really supposed to know and Sandra -- we were back in the van and Sandra was like, you know how Sandra is in surprises -- she's very good at keeping them. And then -- what should I say? -- down, a little while later the scene just shifted, and I was in the dining room and I saw the manual for the model that I was going to have, and I was going to take it over to the video magnifier and read some of it. But I woke up first. And that was that."

But I dreamt that I was at home and there was this woman who came over to talk to me, and she was an elderly woman like Mercy Stinton, except she was calling herself Mrs. Lester, and she was talking like Mrs. Dougherty, so apparently she was a figure that was all of those rolled into one.  Bizarre, man. And I was sitting on the stairs and she was kind of like laying on the stairs above me and like leaning on her elbow so she could talk to me, and she was saying how it would sure be nice if I could be coming back to my high school and attending a chorus rehearsal so that I could be in the concert. And I was explaining to her that I wish I could, but I have college. And you know how people sometimes lay a guilt trip on you and stuff. Well, she was like trying to do that. Anyhow, she had this sweet old lady kind of a voice, and Mrs. Dougherty doesn't lay a guilt trip on people if they're not actually in the group full time, but this woman did. So she was talking to me about coming to rehearsals and all, and I can't remember, but I think she gave me a teddy bear and some kind of diamondy-like Christmas ornament. And I'm trying to think what else. I let it slip away because I went back to sleep this morning instead of record it. A thing with me is sometimes I wake up with a really dry throat and feel like \"bleah....\", I'm in a groggy sleep state, and if I get out my tape machine and record my dreams, I'll sound like really far away like I do sometimes, and I'll be all dry, and you know how that goes. So I think I wait until I'm a little more awake and I'll sound a little more normal, but then I forget half the dumb thing. And sometimes I'm too lazy to reach over and grab this thing, so I guess I'll just have to do that."

So went there, and he drove me over this great big bridge to get in there. And it was kind of more like a playground than a theme park. They had all of this furniture and things out of wood and they had little play things out of wood, but there weren't really any rides per se. So we were for a little bit. He sat and he waited for me, and I took like I don't know how long, a little while. And then I decided that I should call Elizabeth and see if she could come meet us here. And she wasn't there, obviously, like she never is. And so then I was home and we were looking at this catalog at dresses and things and my mother was telling me that she had a dream about the chickens, and that they were eating, like they hadn't eaten in two days because of seed. And I went out there and fed them, and they did that for me. There was a white one and a brown one, and they were eating out of my hand like feverishly. And I think that's all there is."

And I could see the buses leaving from the bus compound, and there was a school bus that was coming to the house for me, and so I had to, Astrid and I just ran back to the house to try and beat them, but we didn't make it."

And I stood up and yelled at them and ran them off, and they had collars, I think, because I heard them clinking. And my father got up and went off and ran after them and he came back and he said he caught one of them and he had it in a covered box.

First I dreamt that my mother and I were at my college and going around to my classes, and it was like a holiday, so they had like stands where they had free food. And I was going around with a box collecting some, and my mother decided she was going to take it home. Let's see, they had everything that they were giving away, even little bags of chicken nuggets, and I kind of, I excused myself because I had to go to class. We went out riding bikes and I was riding the tandem by myself and my mother and my father were riding their bikes, and I was doing all kinds of silly stuff, like spinning around and around and around and around and kind of, you know, like that. And coming up to the point where the sidewalk changed, this is at South Bend Beach area, and I realized that they had gotten really far ahead of me, and that I should just catch up. And where the sidewalk changed there was this big round cover, and there were a bunch of little ones in front of it. And it was like I couldn't go around it so I had to ______ down and walk over it, and the bike was so light I could pick it up and carry it. And I went until I caught up with them, and my father had realized that my chain had fallen off, and he put it back on, and by then there was some lightning and thunder. And we were starting to turn around and head back home. Now I have a more vivid memory, and I remember when we turned around and headed back, the tandem was full-size again and I was on the back of it with my father and we were riding home. And then the scene kind of like shifted, and I was here in my bed and it was dark, and I was listening to the radio, which in reality it didn't come on yet, but in my dream it was on, and it was this techno-y rap kind of thing. And there was this scary techno song that had a s_____ score that goes, \"Dee dee dee dee dee,\" and then, \"Bee bee bee bee bee bee bee,\" and then, \"Dee dee dee dee dee.\" And in my dream it was just really scary because it had that interval in it, and so I reached over and I was changing it to something else, that was, I guess, something smoother and easier. And then I realized that there was this person in my bed, supposedly my mother. I had the feeling that I knew who it was. But the person's skin was like wet, and I was thinking how it would be alright to listen to the techno-y song if my mother was there and I could hold her and all, but it was some person, maybe even a doll with wet skin, and so I had to get away from that scary thing and go to something else. And then I woke up and it was light out."

That is why it's still with me in the middle of the day, because I was too lazy to go get another tape this morning. So that's that. I don't think I'd do as vivid of a description if I recorded it in the middle of unconsciousness, like when I first wake up. But anyway, last night I dreamt that my mother and I were walking home from someplace and we were talking about getting my father this vintage collectible fire truck, remote control activated thing, for Christmas, you know, like the things Sam used to have. And we were saying how great it would be because it was nice and painted, and I had the notion that he collected fire memorabilia, but he doesn't -- Christian does. And so we were talking about getting that for him, but then I realized that when you make it back up, it does this stupid back-up alarm sound and that wouldn't be good. So we decided not to get it for him. But, you know, he got it for himself, and I kind of had the notion in my mind that he had agreed to -- I guess play with it while I wasn't home, kind of like I blast the sound system while he's not home. But anyway, in amongst all that ruckus I dreamt that I was watching a Celine Dion Las Vegas concert on my mother's TV in her room, and I guess I think I remember watching her sing a song of some kind, kind of like a _______, something in Latin, in a black dress.  And then the pace picked up a little bit, but instead of singing, for all her dancers and cast, she was like suggesting fashions that would look good on them, going around and giving them these clothes to change into. And this one girl got pants that were slightly longer than the shorts of the others, and she asked why and Celine politely put it that her thighs were a little big and she needed something longer to make them look prettier. And I don't think that went over too well with the girl. And then, in the middle of the TV thing, I heard my father's fire truck thing that he supposedly got for himself in my dream, outside. Speaking of back-up alarms, there's two of them going at the construction site across the street, but they're not the scary kind. I don't know if this will pick them up or not. They stopped now. But anyway, I heard his thing that we supposedly got for him outside in the back yard and I had the notion that he was running it in the dirt, and I couldn't see it, and it was going, \"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" and I could hear it from inside, so I was kind of like in a panic. And I went in my closet and I closed the door, and I sat and I covered my ears, but it was still the same level, in fact it was coming a little closer and getting a little louder. And he was even running his belt sander to cover up the sound so I wouldn't hear it, and it was still audible to me. And, you know, in real life that wouldn't be true.  But soon after I woke up and I realized it was all a dream.  They've been advertising the Hess (?) truck, you know, that they do every year on pretty much everywhere I've been listening, so maybe my subconscious was remembering the little truck that Brittany had that would make that crazy sound when it would back up. And Brittany was sensitive, though, she wouldn't do it while I was around once she figured out that it scared me. In fact, she was trying and trying to turn the sound off of that thing. And I think I was combining those two. You know, I don't know, I think that it's one of those crazy things that just comes up as a figment of the imagination. I don't think it means anything. One more thing, while I was cuing up a VS tape to record \"American Dreams\" last night, there was a Celine Oprah interview preview thing, and she was singing, and I had to put the tape on fast forward, but I wanted to watch the picture, so it was like, \"do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-ahhh.\"  And I guess I was imagining all kinds of crazy things going on as I was watching the elaborate Las Vegas show go by really, really, really, really fast. And I think that's it."

I'm not sure if it was a real plane or a Disneyland ride, but it was something that I was flying in, like some kind of tour or something. And we were like shooting up, you know how that goes. And there was like this tour guide that was talking and saying something about how we go up into the atmosphere and we're in this dark realm where we can see the planets and things, and then we go up further and we actually escape the earth's gravitational force. And it's like, this doesn't make sense, man, if you can see the earth and you're out of its gravitational force, but I guess it's the orbit that I'm thinking of. We could be in orbit and see the planet, but still be in its gravity and then shoot way far out in the middle of nowhere and then be out of orbit and just spinning free.

It was some other kind of program that was kind of similar, but instead of just being in my studio here on the west wall, my machine was set up on a little wobbly table inside my closet, and I only had a little bit of elbow room one way or another. And the light from the monitor kept it from being too dark in there. And somehow I had a little bit of some kind of sound system in there. And I'm trying to think now, what happened. Oh, I think before any of this I had lent my machine to Terri, I mean the whole shebang, the monitor and everything, because hers is one of those all-in-one things and hers was down and out for whatever reason, and she had this paper thing she had to finish for her job, and so I lent it to her. And she brought it back to me and was setting it up in my closet like I needed it to be. And, let's see, I didn't feel claustrophobic in my closet. I felt okay, and I seemed to be content in that little mess. I was still a little crowded out, but I was okay, other than that. And I can't remember much else. Oh, I know. The scene kind of like shifted all of a sudden, and I was in the church, and instead of listening to just eight or ten magical singers, I was listening to this great big, huge choir singing and accompanied by an organ. And their songs were all right, but they weren't that impressive. Things are never as impressive as they should be in dreams, for some reason. Whenever I would dream of opening presents, usually they're like boring things. And things are just usually not as exciting in dreams as in reality. But maybe that's for the fear that they won't be. And that's all I can really remember. I think the thought of working comfortably in my closet relates to the fact that I think I would be just fine if I were by myself and nobody knew, like what I was doing or how much time I was spending on one thing, and I was just working along at my own pace, twiddley-dee, twiddley-da . And I guess lending my machine to Terri is something kind of literal. I wrote the Christmas wish letter for her, and hers is like so old, running always 8.6, bless her heart, she can't even get online. And I've offered that if she needs to run around on a faster platform, she's done enough printing for me, she should come over and run around on a faster platform for a little while. But I guess that's just some crazy thing that entered my mind."

I was first, and most prominently, even though I think it was last, I dreamt that I had to go back to my high school for some reason, I didn't know why. But then I went in this office that was kind of dark and it had several layers in it, like it had several steps down in places, like the sound both at Ace Field. And I realized that it was the VE Specialist's office and I had to talk to Ms. Coombs. And I told her that I'm not back here to take any more academic classes. I've already graduated. I'm back here, I think it was to take chorus class or something, which I guess that would be explainable because I'm working closely with Mrs. Dougherty and I'm volunteering at my high school and I have one of my high school's volunteer ID's. And then Ms. Coombs finally got it and then Mrs. Hollander came up, and I was practicing speaking Spanish to her, and I was telling her that my mother will be there with her painting on Monday, and different stuff like that. And from what I remember about what I was speaking, it was correct grammatically. And, let's see, what else? Oh, before any of that, I was here in my bedroom with this really long tape that was given to me like in the four track format that the Library of Congress records in, and it was this kids' cartoon tape about different historic events that happened. It was about Christopher Columbus and his Spanish friend that came to America, and they were just being real goofy and silly on the tape. And I was trying to get to the part, I guess it was the other side of the tape that was talking about reading music, and Mrs. Dougherty wanted me to listen to it. But there was so much of this Christopher Columbus goofiness that I didn't get to the other part. I can't remember too much more, but I have this vague memory that me and four other people were in this crowded little store like an antique shop, but we were practicing singing in there. We were each dressed up as a different character, which they were last night, and there was an accompanist there kind of leading us. And we sang something and like everybody started crying, and I didn't and I was wondering what was the big sad thing here. I couldn't figure it out. And I think that's all."

            "content": "I had a dream about sound last night, and now I've just got to remember what it was. We were at this place like the Grays Point or Beeker Park, and they were having this kind of little festival thing with cupcakes and different little craft booths and different things going on. And there was this little area only reserved for VIP's and only VIP people could go there. And it had this little orange net fencing surrounding it, you know like they do sometimes at blockade sites. Well, there was a gap in the orange net fencing and my father was putting bulb (?) and just ___ back there. We didn't know it was only for VIP's and we didn't have a pass, and once we got back there, everybody was very accommodating to us. And we went up on this deck and we saw some sound equipment, like a couple microphone stands and a couple amps and mixers and things laying around. And that was pretty cool, but then the deck was like the deck of a house or something that had a door on the front, like the front door of a house. But when you went in this front door, it would be really, really dark with only a little window at the top. And it was a narrow hallway, and it was deep. I mean, I should say it was a deep way down from the deck to the floor, and there was a window up high. The doors had windows in them. And the window light reflected against the wall and it looked gray. And we go down this tunnel. Well, first of all, in my dream I like was in a hurry to get in this door because there was a lot of sophisticated equipment in there, or so I thought. And I think this is an important part of the dream. And I went in the door and let it close behind me, I was so scared and petrified that it was so dark, that I opened the door and I waited a few minutes for my father to come with me. And he came with me and we, it seemed a little lighter when he was there with me. And boy, I'm using up tape like crazy here. Why I can't stop stuttering and la la la blah. Oh well, anyway, it seemed lighter when he was down there, and there was some kind of a sound system in there that had a couple of subs that went, \"boom, boom, boom\" with some kind of rap beat, you know how it goes in those big cars? Except it wasn't that intense; it was about the level of mine, but it was just kind of isolated and not a whole lot of highs or anything else. And I thought, \"Hey, that's cool,\" and I had a feeling like it was like a testing site. And went down this hall and we came out. It led into like a nice little shop thing, and this shop had everything from like candy canes to little ornament ball things, to baskets of goodies and stuff. And I had a feeling it was like somebody's house, but it was a shop too, and there was a lady there that was real nice and kind and accommodating to us, and gave us something, I don't remember what, from her kitchen table, something like a sample to eat. And then we went out the door and we were back at the Beeker Park place, and my father said, \"Want to do that again?\" and I said, \"Yeah.\" So we stepped into the orange fencing, we went up on the little deck, I saw the equipment up on the deck, we went down in the little dark tunnel thing with the subs that were booming and went through the lady's little shop, and, hey, that was fun. It was like a round, round, round circle. We did it a couple times. And then I had Astrid with me and my father, and I was leading Astrid up onto the deck and down into the little dark tunnel thing, and the tunnel thing seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it. I think that's symbolic. And this time I was leading Astrid through it, and I lead her, she wasn't scared at all, of course. Well, even though she couldn't see, she knew it was kind of dark in there and cramped and tight, and she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And then I led her into the shop thing, except it had transformed this time, and not only was it that lady's shop, it was like somebody's bedroom. And we were like snooping in somebody's bedroom and they had a whole stack of CD's and stuff, and Astrid was wanting me -- and all of these CD's were new, they were wrapped, like the shrink wrap. And Astrid was telling me, \"Tell me what this one is, tell me what this one is,\" and some of the titles I could read and some I couldn't. And just before I woke up, there was this CD that had the cover of like a green spider web, and it had white lettering on it that said \"50 cents,\" you know, like the rapper guy. And then I woke up. Man, that was something. And, you know, it's evening time and it stayed with me the whole day. Isn't that amazing! But I think this is kind of symbolic. In the past I have had a few dreams about a roundy-roundy-round circle that just is continuous, like, for example, I had a dream one time that a cellar went down into a sub-cellar that led out into a, like a netting tube that you would go up and get in the attic. And when you were in the attic, there would be a whole bunch of stuffed animals and it would be kind of hard to breathe in there. And you would have to fight your way through tons and tons and tons of stuff in order to get out of there. It was kind of like my mother's attic is. And then you would be in the house, and that was a circle that involved dark and scary places. Now this circle had a dark and scary place, but it was only one, and it involved sound, which makes me think about life when I analyze this. The fact that the tunnel seemed lighter and safer each time I went through it, I think has to do with experiences that are new and odd and scary. They seem easier each time I have the same experience, and I think the first time that I went in there when I was so scared and petrified and I waiting for my father, I think some experiences are like that. I am afraid to do them on my own, and even though he's more critical and slower and harder, I want to have somebody help me through them. And I think the lady's shop symbolizes like a house, like almost being in a home-like environment. I don't know, I'm drawing a blank there. But the fact that I had Astrid on this round circle thing with me, I think is that I think I've had enough in the sound industry that I can start leading Astrid through it. And that's all I have to say for now. My throat is dry and I've used up enough tape. Another thing I thought of, I think the fact that we started out that an event at Beeker Park or the Grays Point and going in that VIP section and people not minding us just barging in there has to do with the fact that coming into the sound industry in all this stuff, I started not knowing a darned thing and being at events like that, at public places, and wanting to go behind and wanting to just jump over those stupid fence things, and wanting to go talk to the people and they never really minded it. And that, inside the VIP fence is like inside another world. And I think -- I don't know if this circle was about life, or if it was about the other world contained in the sound industry, or whether it's about both. I don't know, but that's that."

And she was saying \"Good job\" to everybody, even though nobody else sang. That was funny. And I think we were getting some kind of stage ready for some kind of performance. We were deciding who was going to be where and what we were going to do. And then she took me aside and she asked me, she told me that she knows how to read music on a staff, but she wanted to know how do you read music in the form of mini data in an arrangement window, you know, like with the vertical keys and the lines and the grid and stuff. Well, that's what I was going to teach her how to read. And I was going to write a little book on that at home, but I was having a tough time finding some paper. And there were some other things going on. I think somebody wanted me to hurry up and get out of the house with them to go somewhere, and I didn't have time to make this book. And just before I woke up, I was writing out part of it. I remember something else about this dream now. This was a really important part. I don't know how I could forget. I dreamt that the phone rang or something and called me away from what I was doing, and I had to leave my computer like at the desktop, the Mac. And I ran to the phone and got called away, or something, and when I came back, I found my father sitting in my chair getting into my folder of word processing, all my journal and stuff, and just reading. For some reason he sized the window down to a little tiny, tiny thing and he was just reading, and he said, \"I see you _____ a word processor here. Why would you be doing that?\" And I'm thinking, \"Ahhhh, this is the death of me!\" And I finally convinced him that he shouldn't be looking at that, that that's a private thing, and somehow I didn't need to give any more of an explanation. Then some older lady was working with me and she took me online to get something, I don't know what, but something audio that was playing through the task scan, and somehow she shut me down without getting me offline, and usually in the world, you just automatically get offline when you shut down, if you don't already. But I was all up in arms that I hadn't been disconnected from the line, and so she had to start up all over again and get me offline and shut down. And I don't know what happened after that."

And, okay, I dreamt that we were babysitting that girl Annie from the Barrett's house and she's kind of an immature kind of blah kind of person, and she had this program, you know, like they give out in the theaters, that kind of program, for this Brian Adams concert that I'm supposed to go to for Christmas. And I asked her if she could tell me what the date was that the performance was going to be, and she didn't really know how to count; she kept getting all mixed up. She kept telling me, \"26, 25,\" and I kept telling her, \"I think you mean 12/25.\" And she's like, \"Oh no, it says here 26, 25.\" Wonder what that can mean? And she was opening it up, and for some reason it had all these stickers in it and her ticket, and I don't know what the stickers were for. They were like hearts and flowers and teddy bears. And I couldn't really read the date; it was too small. And then I went into the kitchen and there was this thing sitting on the counter, and I picked it up and I thought it was a piece of chocolate. And I took a little taste of it, and it was lipstick, and I was like, \"Bleah!\" And I've never really done that, so I don't know where that came from. And then I was coming out to ride the bike with my father, and I had this dress on that came to my mid thighs, and it was really cold, but I had this dress on. And I don't know why, and I was going to ride the bike in this dress. And that's all I can remember. I think I woke up after that, but I don't know."

I dreamt that after my exams were over and I was in my last meeting of Electronics class, Mr. Martin kind of really like surprised us and said that he wanted to take us all on a trip to the beach and stay there overnight, and so that we could look at the sunset and the wave length and the frequencies of light and how they change. And I was really surprised that we were going without any further notice, without any bags, without any anything.  And so the kids in the class didn't really want me to go because they were afraid that I would get lost, that I wouldn't know where I was going and what I was doing, and stuff like that, like I've always had to deal with. And I was just kind of bull-headed and assertive and said that I've been to the beach lots of time with my family and that this will be nothing. And so next thing I know, I was there and we were all sitting around and talking and I was swimming with them in the water. And we just kind of swam around and I guess we stayed the night; I don't even remember too much. But when we got back to the house, it didn't even look like what I'm used to. It was this big, fancy, ornate lobby which they're known for and I had to get something out of his class, so I had to go upstairs. Oh, for some reason we were sitting in his classroom that was more like a living room, and it was dark and we were just all talking about the trip and what a wonderful time we had. And then we all went out and I was kind of going in the opposite direction of all the people and waiting for a minute or two because there was this whole table full of candy. They had like big dishes with lids on them, and I'm sure that anybody could just go in there and get some. But then I kind of lost interest. They hung around and they hung around, and I figured I had to get home and I think at the time I had the cell phone in my pocket, and I turned it on in case they needed to locate where I was. And they had this -- it must have been three stories, but it was real open and each story had real high ceilings -- and there was this roundy roundy round, real narrow staircase, just about my arm span wide. So I was hanging on, each hand to a railing on each side of this running down these stairs and spiraling around and around until I finally, I didn't even get to the bottom and I heard them calling my name on the intercom. And I couldn't really say anything or yell out that I was on the stairs or anything, and the office was right in front of the staircase. And the office had clear doors like the Learning Support Center does. And I can't remember actually reaching the bottom, but I remember being in the office and meeting up with my father and not knowing what was going to happen after that. And then I woke up."

            "content": "Last night I had a really crazy dream. First I dream that, in addition to my three classes out at my college, I was taking a fourth one here at my high school, like a dual enrollment thing. So what I was supposed to do is go to my high school, be at that class from like 7:20 to 8:00 o'clock, then go out to my college and be at the next class by 8:30. So this class was taught by Ms. Arlo, which was the teacher that I had my first semester of the 9th grade, and she was strange, bizarre, bland, and I could never figure her out. She taught critical thinking and learning skills, which was a really boring, stupid course. But in my dream she was teaching that class again, and I had to take her class at the college level, and it was like a dual enrollment thing, I guess. And Elizabeth was there, and I think I went to the first class, but I didn't go to that class any more after that. In my dream I only had three classes at my college and I only went to those three classes. And in my dream I had no idea what my classes were at my college, and I got a notice in the mail and a little card that had my exam score from Ms. Arlo, and I had gotten a \"D\" on her exam.  And I was thinking to myself, \"Now gee, I don't even remember taking that exam. I don't even remember having that class, so what's up with this grade?\" Then I remembered I had the class, but I skipped it, all but one day, and I didn't take the exam. And then the scene kind of changed and I was at this picnic party that I think was at like the remote park like Lake Sumner, and we were -- it might have even been Jenny Springs, I'm not sure, but we were by some water and it was kind of a nice even temperature -- not real cold and not real warm. And there were trees around and there were picnic tables all over everywhere. And it was somebody's birthday. And there was this guy I knew who was kind of like my best friend, and there was supposed to be Elizabeth's family and some fireman people in the neighborhood. We were going to all get together for this man's birthday. Anyway, I had the Peavey system. Where I got power for it, I don't know. Don't ask me.  But anyway, that wasn't an issue in my dream. It was just supposed to run. And, let's see, there was a birthday cake, and here's the funny part: I had borrowed Astrid's keyboard because somebody was going to play and I didn't know how to, and it was set up and connected to the Peavey system and this guy was just jamming away, whose birthday it was. I didn't know who he was. And then I went off to do something else. I think I was running streamers from one tree to another. And then, before I knew it, I was back at the guy, and the thing turned into a cake. And I'm thinking, \"Oh, my gosh, what's Astrid going to say?\"  That was crazy. And that was a cake and everybody was cutting up and having a piece. Oh geez. And then the scene suddenly shifted and I was at this movie theater setting up the Peavey system there. There was supposed to be some kind of screening of some kind, some kind of VIP party, and things were really, really running late and it was kind of like I was going to be sitting around for the next few hours waiting for people. And then I woke up. That was a strange conglomeration of things. Also another funny part as this dream was ending and I was waking up and fading into consciousness and coming to, I thought back about my classes at my college, and I was thinking, \"Could I have really gotten that grade on that exam or what here?\" And I couldn't remember any of my classes. I had to think about when was my lunch hour. Then I remembered I had Electronics class, then I remembered Music and Computers class, and then I woke up a little more and remembered Psychology, but I couldn't remember the first one. And it wasn't until I was like fully awake for a few minutes that I remembered, oh, it was Business Law, which I was a little doubtful of how I was going to do on that exam, so that might be where this dream got started. Also another part of this dream could have come from the fact than when I interned at Ace Field, during the baseball games they'd have all kinds of corporate plugs, people could win things and advertise a corporation. And Sam Ash Music sponsored a happy birthday thing for every game, and they would tell the birthdays of famous people. And they would show the organist's fingers playing \"Happy Birthday\" and then suddenly the picture would materialize into a birthday cake with a Sam Ash Music picture on it, so that might be a seed of that thought."

The first one started at like 1:00, and why I keep dreaming about having to go to classes, don't ask me. I'm sick of dreaming that. But anyway, my first one started at 1:20 and it was like 1:16 and my mother was sitting at the dining table just writing and stuff like that, and I was telling her, \"You should go get the truck and bring it around. I'm going to be late for class.\" And she said, \"No you won't; you'll be fine.\" But it got to the point where I was shaking her by the shoulders and yelling and crying, telling her to get moving because I was going to be really late for class. And it was kind of hard because I was just screaming. And I can't remember, but I think it was like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" kind of blah. Then I was in this party room with these people and it was supposed to be something like a dance performance thing. It was going to be filmed on live TV and I was just kind of in the audience with the people. And it was a small room with a kind of a wooden floor, and it was, I think it was for the show \"Fame\" and I had the notion that \"Crispen\" won it last year--who the heck Crispen is, I don't know. And I was going in and out this room and going to the bathroom and few times, and then I came back and I was sitting around with people and they were talking about what they were going to do. And this one girl was doing some homework and needed to use bright (?) calculator, and it was really acting funny and we couldn't figure out why. And then suddenly I was, it was my father out at this little tiny building that I guess resembled the church that we had the party at, but it was more like a movable portable facility than that. And we had to go there for some kind of business, but I wasn't real keen on going in there because I had heard that their alarm system was real unreliable and could pretty much go off at any time when somebody so much as shook the place the wrong way. And so I stood back a few feet while they opened the door, and things were okay in there. And in my dream I really had to go to the bathroom, but I didn't want to because I was afraid that sitting down on the toilet and going would either make the alarm off or I would be lucky enough to be in there when, just happen to. So I didn't, I kept walking around for a little bit, doing different things, getting stuff ready for some kind of event. And I finally went to the bathroom, and then I woke up, and I had to go when I woke up."

I dreamt that I was in this group of people. I think we were either singers or performers or something. And we were in a band room and we were kind of being taught by a man, but instead of rehearsing or stuff, we were talking about Greek mythology and we were talking about how to go around and take the path and the journey to find Theseus (?). I guess the ____ stories are going to my head. And so we decided we were going to take this little jaunt, trip so maybe we would finally understand how it went. And my mother was kind of volunteering with that and she came back to get me because everybody kind of left me behind. And everybody was going on their way and my mother was driving me in this van that is like the yellow cab van, except it wasn't yellow, it was brown. And it had like a two-way radio in it and I could hear Sparky talking. He's the cab dispatcher. And, oh, my mother was showing me that she bought these pins of like different figures for people to wear, and I was like dressed in this costume. And I don't remember ever getting there. And before that, I dreamt that I was investigating around by the tree, and that I had a longer, a box that was longer than it was wide and kind of not that high, and heavy and dense, and it was wrapped in green paper. Now I don't know if this is a prophetic image or if it's just wishful thinking, but I tend to believe it's just wishful thinking. And now I don't remember any more."

I dreamt that I was attending this special school for like handicapped people, I guess because they were an institution known to do a lot of help for people and make a lot of things go well for people, and so they thought it would be good for me to go and visit them and see what they could do for me. And, believe it or not, it was like this private school, K-12, and since this was my first year with them, they put me in a first grade class.  And I went to this first grade class for two days, I think, and then I realized that this was not just a health institution that would try to help you. This was a school that they were going to try to put you through their twelve years of education no matter how old or young you were, and how many you'd already been through. And then the scene kind of shifted, and I was like, I had a place that I had, somebody had given me. It was a dinky little apartment thing, and I was living on my own. Actually I was living on my own part of the time and living at home part of the time. And I was in this dinky little apartment getting some work done and stuff, and I called home and it was 5:00 in the evening and my mother and my father were like, \"Where the heck are you? If you're going to leave the house, you tell us first.\" They didn't even know I had this place. And then I was, I think it was the next day, and I was going back to this place, I was going to bring them my high school diploma, show them that I had already graduated, show them that I was in college now and disconnect myself from them. So I went in the office and I had my high school diploma, and I chatted with the ladies; they seemed really nice. And I just told them, \"I don't wish to take any more classes here. Thank you.\" And I walked out, and I showed them, and they seemed so impressed. I couldn't figure out what were they so impressed about? And I think shortly thereafter I was kind of in the phase of stage 1 sleep and waking up, and I was thinking how, I had the notion that the campus that I attended now of my college was really called Panella's Park High and it just had facilities for college students in the back forty, kind of like. But when I was fully awake, I realized that I was still attending my college. How come I keep having dreams about these educational conflicts? I keep dreaming that I'm back at my high school or that I'm not really where I am yet, I think because it's still for me to even believe."

Then it came down to that we missed the plane because we were opening gifts, and I figured, \"Okay, we're just going to have to stay in my relative's home town for a few more hours until the next outgoing flight.\" And that was kind of good because we could go to somebody's house and stay a little longer. Well, it just so happened that -- I know this is very unrealistic -- but my father drove all the way up from my home town because he somehow found out that we missed the plane. See, we were going to tell him that our flight was cancelled, but somehow he found out that we missed the plane. And so he drove up and he was going to get us and bring us home, and he was mad, mad, mad at that old red hen, hen, hen.  And we also missed the Bryan Adams concert and I was jumping up and down and saying that, \"You have to take me to an equivalent one.\" Something else, but I can't remember. And that's basically it.

The first one, I had the notion that I was interning at some kind of TV station like Time Warner, yet it was kind of like the Dome at where I was. And I think it was, I couldn't really figure out what it was, but I was in this control room and I had like all kinds of video equipment and a small mixing board in the back. And there was this real crowd of people in there. I couldn't figure out who they were, but this one guy was supposed to be the manager and his name was Sam, kind of like the guy we missed at Wussaker (?) Hall, and there were a couple of guys that I thought I know, and there was a whole bunch of people that I didn't even know that I was kind of wondering why the heck were they there. And we were supposed to get this show on the road, and I was supposed to help somebody with something. And there were about four or five people crowded behind the board trying to do all do the same thing at once.  Gee, where have I heard this before? And, of course, I was just kind of sitting in a little corner observing all this commotion and ruckus going on, and then I kind of faded into another scene where I was walking down the sidewalk and I had to go through an obstacle course. And I was trying to tell somebody about my experience when I was going through an obstacle course. And one of the things I had to go through -- I didn't really have to go through anything but this one thing. In front of Jean's house where she has that fence, white picket fence, it kind of came out to the sidewalk and enclosed and made a box, and I had to crawl in the box and they close the door and then open it on the other side so I could get out. So when they closed the box, it was so small and tight, I could barely move through it, and there was a top on it like I was in a bunny cage. And then I came out the other side of the bunny cage and I went on my way and I was okay. But when I was in the bunny cage, I thought I'd never get out of it. I think this came from when I was like 3 and used to sit in the bunny cage and feed the bunny, but I never used to mind because I could get out from the inside. Anyway, the next little dream I had after I kind of woke up from it and went to the bathroom and stuff, is that I was back at my high school again -- I can't get away from dreaming about my high school and other schools I've been to . But anyway, it was either -- I think it was a cross between my high school and my elementary school. And I was skating on roller skates through the hallway, I think because I was just there to kind of help out with something. I wasn't really there to actually go. And I can't remember too much except I was in PE class again, and we were doing jumping jacks out in the courtyard thing. And, you know, I can't remember anything more. That's a bummer."

I was going to like sit and watch the game, and we were hoping that I could like sit in the press box and go to the sound booth or something like that. And we were describing who we were and my mother just casually mentioned that I graduated from high school. And the lady whisked us and said, \"Here, let's put you in the graduate section.\" And there was a VIP area for people who had graduated from high school. And she took us off down this little hall and brought us in this little booth. It was kind of like a sound-proof booth. And they passed out -- there were like five of us in there and there was one lady. I was sitting up on a high stool so that I could actually see down and out the window what was going on. And, of course, I couldn't always see what was going on in the field, but I could see all the people in the bleachers and stuff. And this lady was like in her 70's, and she was like, \"Can I trade with you?\" And so I sat on the far right, down on the lowest stool I could, and I couldn't even see up above the window. And she sat in the middle in between like the five of us. There were like three boys and only two girls. And she passed out like snacks and little prizes to us; it was like complimentary things that came with being in that section. And we were supposed to get to hear all kinds of like inside stuff, but they didn't send it over our system. Ours -- and get this -- this was the craziest part -- the system that they had us hear did not carry the songs that, the periodic songs and announcements that Bobby mixed, and apparently we were just supposed to watch the game without sound. And they played teenage rap and R&B; stuff over the system that we heard. And that was crazy. I wanted to hear Bobby's mix. And I was thinking about how, when I was there at regular games in the sound booth, and I got to listen in on him talking about what to do and when to do it, I missed hearing all that because that was like really the inside scoop, the ultimate inside scoop. And, of course, to be able to coordinate it to listening to Bobby's mix and looking at the monitor when I could see what the video person was doing. And also there's another part to this dream that I remember. Before any of that, I dreamt that I was having a sleep-over birthday party with Astrid and Linda and Darlene and one or two other people from the Wilcox Center. I think Arlene Thurston must have been there too. And I think we had like just woke up and we were going down to have breakfast. For some reason Linda and me and one other girl were sitting on a towel eating in front of the TV. And Linda was bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me and bugging me, like she does, about letting her go into my studio and make a copy of a CD. And she wanted a copy of like Asa Base (?) and now that I think of it, I don't know why the heck she would want that one because she doesn't like that kind of stuff. But in my dream that's what she wanted a copy of. And I was thinking of how, when my mother gets breakfast on and everyone's eating breakfast, I'll just run up there, make a copy real fast and bring it down and give to Linda so she'll have it and I won't have to have her mess through all my stuff and everything. And then when I got in there and I was sitting down to make the copy, I realized that I didn't have an original, and therefore the STMS was going to scream and yell in my face, and so I had to put in my personal CD player and do an analog. And that's when I kind of woke up."

Not my conscious, of course, but you know what I mean. Well, I don't know exactly where to start because this was another one of those rambling saga-like type dreams, but I'll start at the part that I can remember the best. I dreamt that -- I think this is where it starts -- I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning to go to the bathroom, and I had a dream before, but this is the only part I can remember now. Okay, I dreamt that I was in this portable classroom. I didn't know if I was at my college or my tech school, but I was at one of them, and I was in a portable and the lights were off. And there was carpet on the floor and there were like traditional student desks. And we were going to have a presentation by Bill Putnam, who's the sound engineer, great. He's left us now, but in my dream he was still alive and he was going to come give a lecture. And for some reason I had this, it was listed in like a program that he was going to give a concert on a Hammond B3 organ, and so he came in the room, he talked to us a little, he greeted us, he was like in his 70's. He was kind of in his 70's or 80's and he kind of barely knew what he was doing.  And he was talking to us, and before I knew it, he was doing this mime of like trying to show that there was these rotten eggs and how they were smelling, and there were these teddy bears, these teddy bear heads on a stick that somebody was swirling around above the supposedly rotten eggs. And there was like a little _________ things. He was doing this whole mime, and, of course, I wasn't getting much out of it because I couldn't see what the heck he was doing. And about three desks over, to my right, kind of in the front of the room, there was this guy, kind of like a side man with a keyboard, that was supposed to play chords and all that were going on behind the mime to kind of give it some music. And this guy was bad, to say the least!  He was, I don't know, it just sounded really, really bad and he didn't know what he was doing either. He was just kind of like banging around, and it didn't go with anything that was going on. And then, I don't know what happened, but the scene just sort of like suddenly switched, and we were supposed to go on a boat trip at night. I keep having dreams that my father and us and the family are supposed to go on this boat. And so I dreamt that we were going on a boat trip, and I don't remember where we were going, but I know we were going to go at night. Oh, I remember -- this is kind of crazy, man. I don't know where this came from, but apparently, I think I kind of visualized this when we were out on our walks and this is where it came from, but I was supposed to be on the boat and sing and give a concert to some thousands of people who were along the shoreline and on docks and at the Coachman and the Wayne Point Park and stuff. And apparently not only was I supposed to sing, but I was supposed to play too, and I had an instrument for me there on the boat, or at least I thought they were going to have one there for me. It's one of those things where you think it's going to be there, but you never see it, I guess because, I don't know, but anyway, it was supposed to be there, and it was supposed to be there, supposed to be there. And I get on this boat and it's there, and we were getting settled and stuff and we're ready to take off, and I'm ready to stand up there and sing to the people out there, and the instrument starts shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking and shrinking. And next thing I know it's the size of like something for a Barbie doll. And the captain of the boat told me that I should take it home and put it in the bird cage for Archie , that he would want it and that he could benefit from it because he could learn some notes to sing. And like that's bizarre, man. And I think that is when I woke up. Man, man, man -- as _______ would say. I think I can start maybe unraveling where this dream may have come from. First of all, the Bill Putnam thing came from me reading the studio book, of course, but why he would come in and do a mime about rotten eggs? Don't ask me!  But it's becoming more obvious to me where the singing and playing on a boat would have come from. Astrid has been making up stories about Phil Collins sailing through the Straits of Silla and Corybdus, and playing Silla's favorite piece on the keyboard, which is, I think it is, I don't know, it's called \"Farralene\" (?), it goes [singing] and a couple others, the theme of the Titanic and different things like that. And I guess seeing the boat parade, hearing her stories about that, and being down at the waterfront and visualizing a floating stage and everybody on land watching a performance out there. All that came together and made this bizarre dream. Now the shrinking, I think might be something to the effect that it seems so close, but it's not. And, if you know what I mean, and I don't know, just something goofy that came out of that, I guess."

But in my dream there was this white chicken and my father wanted to wash her off on her back side because she was really getting messy. And so he was going to, he wanted to see if I could hang onto the chicken for him, and he was thinking of putting her in one of the like a harness thing, like you would a dog. And I said, \"I don't think so, Tim. I will hold the chicken with my arms and keep her from getting away.\" And so, sitting on the picnic table with the chicken, she's white, but she kind of has the build and weight of a Rhode Island Red, and they're kind of hard to contain because we only have one left, and she's a red Rhode Island Red, but for some reason in my dream, she was white. And I'm holding the chicken and he's dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dallying around, and I can't figure out why. And then I say that I need to, I realize that it's 2:30 in the afternoon and I haven't had lunch, so and the chicken looks hungry too, believe it or not. So I tell him that he should hold the chicken for a minute so that I can go get some seeds. I went inside and got a bite of my plate and I was kind of disappointed because I was smelling fried food in the chicken, but what I got was only a baloney sandwich. Then I came back out with some seed for the chicken, and I guess that kept her busy for a few minutes, and then we continued the operation. And he was telling me how bad she was looking, how it looked like she had a ton of bacteria and stuff because one time one of our chickens was like in bad shape. And then I think we were done and I let the chicken go. And there was this truck that was going by that had sirens on it and back-up alarms going forward, and I like fell to the ground and rolled over and laid there until it passed. And I can't remember anything more."

And we were like outside in like a park area, and I had to go into the building to use the bathroom, and I needed to ask the counselor and the secretary for a calendar of like time off and stuff like that. And so I went in this like real just blah building and it was like the lady who came out wouldn't let me go any further until I showed her my ID and I could prove that I was going to be a student in a few days. And I dreamt that there was this man counselor that I knew that she directed me towards that I had a feeling that I had had a real technical discussion with before, and that I felt real comfortable with. And he wanted to know if I had decided what kind of mixer board was best for me, and I told him I hadn't yet. And I got the calendar and I went back outside and then I woke up."

            "content": "I don't know if this is all going to fit, but I'm going to try. Last night I had a dream that I was at this theme park, and I can remember bits and pieces of it. Bad me -- I let it drag on until it's 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon now, but I didn't have time to record it this morning when I first woke up. So I dreamt that I was at a theme park with Elizabeth, and it was kind of a school field trip like type thing. And there was this ride called the Kumba Roller Coaster -- it was either the Kumba or the Montu -- it was kind of like Tyme Gardens. And we'd go on this roller coaster and we'd roller coaster around. It would be an \"Ahhhhhhhhhh!\" thrill ride. There was also this ride that I liked that was a slide that would like spray you with water as you were sliding down this big, tall slide, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you were going by, like it had a really neat sound system, which that and spraying water just don't go together, but maybe they did. I think I heard something like that at some kind of theme park, and that's where I got the idea from. And once you got down to the bottom of this big slide, you'd fall into this swimming pool that was really deep and you swam to the other end, and that was okay. And we only had a little bit of time left, but I wanted Elizabeth to go on this slide with me, and she said, \"No, no, I'm too chicken; you have to go by yourself.\" And so I went, but it was kind of funny because the slide wouldn't spray me with the water and there was no sound. All that it was, was that you could slide down the slide and that was it. And I imagined in my dream that this slide was pink and that the pool was pink, instead of blue like they usually are. And so, sorry folks, the tape is coming to an end. I will start over on the next one. Alright, I don't expect this tape to last me more than about a month's worth of material, maybe even less, but it's just a junky marketing tape anyway, and it's no good for anything else, and this is better than having it thrown in the garbage. So, let us begin! I am going to start over and repeat a dream that I wasn't able to fit on the last tape. It is now close to 9:00 o'clock at night and I am kind of fortunate that even part of it has stayed with me this long because I just didn't have the time to do it this morning. So anyway, I dreamt that I was at this amusement park, and I was there with Elizabeth, and it was kind of like Tyme Gardens, except in my dream it didn't really have a name. And we were like on this school field trip and her and I were kind of running around together, and I think everybody else kind of just ditched us. And we were like running around going on these rides. There was this huge, open park picnic area in the middle of the park that kind of reminded me of my college Quad, except that it had picnic tables and stuff and like amusement park type fencing and white-colored tables. And there was this one ride that was like the Mod II or the Kumba, and it was just a roller coaster. You would have to walk up very high to get to it though, like a boardwalk; you'd have to climb stairs and go up ramps and snakes and winds, kind of like you have to do when you're at a theme park, except this was all in the open and on a like a wooden boardwalk. And I wanted to get Elizabeth to go on that, and I think maybe we did, but I have no memory of actually being on a ride. Then there was this other ride that I really, really liked supposedly, and it was supposedly a pink slide that you would slide down and it would spray you with water from the side, and you'd hear these really cool sounds as you'd be going by. Now spraying water and a cool sound system don't exactly go together, but, you know, in theme parks sometimes they may have everything all water-tight. And I was trying to get Elizabeth to go down this slide with me because we only had a little bit of time left and I wanted to make us do this before we had to go. And the slide was pink and I went down it; she was too chicken. And it didn't spray and the water and it didn't make the sounds. It was just like a slide, because I think the park was like going to close, but I didn't feel like it was. And then I like landed in this pool of water, like you would expect at most theme park rides, slide things, and when I first landed in it, the pool had a pink bottom instead of a blue bottom like they usually do. And then as I was swimming behind this other girl, and I became aware that I was swimming over like a grate venting and my feet were about to touch the bottom, then the pool turned blue like they usually are. And you know how in dreams when you dream about swimming, or at least I do, the water like tosses you around and you like, you sink to the bottom as though gravity were holding you down, but you can still breathe by some miracle? This is how I always dream when I dream about swimming in a pool. I don't know why. Usually the water wants to pull me up because I'm a female and I have the female fat buoyancy thing. My father just sinks like a rock. But anyway, I have to really fight to get down and stay down if I want to dive under water, but in my dream I just sort of sink and I can still breathe.  But anyway, enough of that. And so, I don't know how I got myself like all dried off and everything in such a hurry, but we went back to this like classroom that was at the theme park and there was a TV, they were going to show a movie. And I was kind of thinking, \"I want to sit where I can see the movie,\" because I thought it was going to be halfway interesting, but Elizabeth said, \"Nah, nah, let's sit over here in this section where we can goof around and nobody will see us!\" And it was close to one of those like candy machines that they have at my college. And before anything else could happen, I woke up."

Mr. Denton was my economics teaching in my senior year that, I don't know, he thought I was the greatest thing since sliced bread, but all his kids were really kind of \"blah\" anyway, and so was his class. And so he thought I was just so intelligent and so wonderful, but anyway, we went to Mr. Denton's house and they took a bunch of pictures. And he still had his Christmas things up. And we, I was looking at his little village scene set up things and they were really cool. And then we went to the beach, of all places. And we bummed around at the beach, and we were talking about various different things, I can't remember what. And then finally they decided that they were going to take me back to class, and I got there in time for Speech class, but I had totally skipped Ethics class. And I was trying to persuade my mother not to show the pictures from Mr. Denton's class to my father because he would know that I skipped Ethics class. And I think my mother and Elizabeth and Chelsea were going to go somewhere and they were going to come back for me for lunch, but I woke up before any of that happened. Oh, and I dreamt that I was real afraid because the cab people were going to say I was a no-show, so they'd automatically cancel the return trip, and so my mother and Elizabeth and Chelsea were going to come and get me and we were going to go have some more fun after my class.

I dreamt that I finally got the gift that I had been wanting for some time. And, you know, I've been having these dreams. So I finally had it, and it was finally in my closet and I was so proud. And my father was going to help me set it up in my sound studio, but first I had to learn how to flush the toilet without making it clog up.  And the trick of it was you had to hold down the handle until just after the stuff had made it down, and then let it go immediately after that. And if you didn't let it go, or you let it go too soon, the whole thing would be for naught, which for real life, in both of our toilets, we have to hold it down, but it's not the end of the world if we let it go too soon. So a couple, I tried it like three times, but it didn't really work right, and we had this big Jacuzzi like tub in the upstairs bathroom and my father had to take a dream clog stopper out of the tub to kind of let some more air into the pipes, I guess. That was crazy. And, oh my gosh, there was a big flash of lightning outside. But anyway, I can't remember what happened after that, but somebody was going on a plane somewhere. I think it wasn't going to be my mother and I going up to my relative's home town. I think it was going to be my father and my mother going somewhere, and I was finally going to get to investigate my gift. And I woke up before any of that could happen and realized it was a dream.

But I think I laid through a lot of stage one, just kind of half conscious awareness from 5:30 to 6:00 this morning, so that's how it got all fragmented. But some elements that I can remember first is that my application into my tech school I was pretty sure was going to be rejected for some reason, and I had kind of resigned myself to the thought that I just can't be in the sound business because my vision prevents me from doing some, perceiving and acting socially, and I think I move around too slowly on some of the programs and there's no way in the world that I can operate these big huge mixer boards. Now this is all what I'm thinking in my dream, as I'm standing in this yellow room with big boards all over everywhere, almost like our kitchen is now, except it was huge like a warehouse. And I was just standing there thinking, and I had the feeling like there were like tons of people around me, but nobody was saying anything, I didn't hear anything. I was just thinking all of this. [blowing noise] Ummmm, a big blob of snot! Anyway, now that that's out of the way, then the next scene that I can remember is that I was at home. It was like the night before I had classes, like last night was, and I was sick with some kind of cold or flu or something, and I was laying on the couch with my mother and we were kind of almost asleep. And I was singing to her. And I had some kind of thing where I still couldn't go to sleep and I had to get up and take some kind of medicine, so she got up with me. And we went in the kitchen, which was kind of normal, the way it used to be, and she had me take a few pills by drinking down some water and taking them. And then she gave me applesauce that had like peanuts chopped up in it, and I think I ate it and it was good, and as I was eating it, I woke up.  That was kind of crazy, but I think this is a very telling dream that brings out some of the inhibitions that I have and this subconscious fear that I have, that no matter how hard I try, I'm not going to be capable in this field. And even if I were to realize that, I would be just devastated, and I'd probably be like a societal hermit for the rest of my life. At this point I don't know what else to do with my life. I know that's bad, but it is, it's true. And I guess I've been thinking a lot about going away. I've already started a little box of stuff, and I practiced filling out a practice application on last year's, in last year's catalog, and it slipped down behind my bed. And I figured, \"Oh heck, it's just last year's scrap copy anyway; it doesn't matter.\" And I even had a duplicate in my catalog, but I think that might have had something to do with it."

And the other five or six of us -- there were like ten others of us -- and we were just standing there watching. And I figured, \"How am I ever going to learn if I keep going at this rate?\"  And so I was thinking about that when we were sitting in this office. You know how they have the U line, the queue thing? Well, it was dark and they were playing a movie for us while we were waiting because we had to wait like forever and a day. And then I think I had a memory that I was going to ask Uncle Richard if he could lend me his copy of \"A New Day Has Come\" because it was in surround sound, and I was just dying to hear the thing mixed in surround sound, which in real life the truth of the matter is that I saw it in a collection of others in Sound and Vision. And whenever I listen to it, I think, \"Man, would this be great mixed in surround sound!\" And so I was going to borrow it from him and play it on his sound system, since he had a SA CD player, and I think when we were standing in that office waiting for that guy, I was like crying about something, I don't know what! And we were supposed to like, I don't even know what we were going to say. I didn't even know if we were going to see a man advisor or a woman, but it kind of reminded me of Ms. Maggot from Stephen King's memoir, and I think I was going to see somebody like her. And so then I dreamt that I was at Uncle Larry's house -- how I shifted to that scene, I don't know. But instead of being at Uncle Richard's, I was at Uncle Larry's house and I was going to play \"A New Day Has Come\" in surround sound, but somehow I woke up before I could do that.

And so I went there and it was given by this man, this kind of older man, on this huge front porch of this building. It was almost like a stage that this class was given on. And there were like five or six people who were in a van and the rest of us who were just kind of like there. And I guess we were going to take turns being in the van or something. But he was telling us how when one person leads you have to follow them, and if they decide to do one thing or another, it's kind of disrespectful to ask them about it. It's really just the opposite. And so I think we did the Bruce Hornsby song that I've been listening to, I think that's just the way it is. And I wanted to talk to the guy, but the guy thought that I was coming over to criticize him, and he ran. And then I dreamt that my place where I was studying ethics was like up high on a cliff, and I was going to find a better place, but it was so hot.

I came in with my mother and my father, sort of like at the top of a little hallway, and down to one side was an auditorium, a big auditorium, where you know how the seats go, they went down. And to the other side was steps down into the lobby of the building, and all of this was real colorful like their brochures are. It was like in that brown and black and orange mainly, like their brochure pictures are. And to the left there was lots of little treats and stuff that they set out for people coming in, like little glasses with jello and stuff, and little dessert dishes and ice cream and brownies and stuff. And to the right was lots of stuff, lots of other facilities. And my mother and my father kind of trailed behind me and let me run along ahead, and it was like a real maze. By the way, I didn't taste any of the treats; I don't know why. And I went around to this other stairwell that led back up, and I wanted to see what was up there because I -- oh, before that -- this is kind of crazy. For some reason I had this set of cans that I picked up from the floor, and when I got to the bottom of the stairwell I turned around and there was these people standing by this little six-channel mixer up on the wall, they were controlling the sound system of the house. And I gave the set to them, and they said, \"Oh thanks, they belong here.\" And then I turned around and I went up this other stairwell and my mother and my father were like behind me, but they were a few feet behind me. And I met up with this other, I had the notion like he was a sound engineer, but he was kind of giving us a tour, and he took me up this stairwell that turned into like a ladder to his little recording booth. And there was this opening that was like really, really small, and he said, \"Nobody can get in here like this.\" He gave me his, like a ticket thing. I slid it in the slot and the whole ladder moved down and the whole thing opened up so that it was then the opening was about from my chest to my head, so then a person could crawl in. But the recording booth was still so small. I don't know how anybody could sit in there and work comfortably. And I was feeling really claustrophobic at this point because not only was I going to have to go in the small recording booth, but I was going to have to go in the, it was just real tight all around. And then he took us down and outside, and kind of around the back of the building, and we were like in a straw barn and we were sitting on benches kind of outside the straw barn, with hay all around and stuff. And there was a reinforcement system out there in the straw barn, and some guy turned it on and walked away. And for some reason I was so bold, I went up and I sat down at the mixer bench area, and the mixer board was green, kind of like an integrated circuit board, but it had all the stuff right on it, and it was flat. I found the two left and right CD faders and I brought them up, and I tweaked some EQ and stuff, and I was watching the videos (?) and finally I brought up my master a little.

My mother said that we're going to have to go into this auditorium, and we went in and we were seeing this like play.

Believe it or not, it stayed with me most of the day. Okay, last night I dreamt that I was going with my father to this big expansive, empty parking lot to take the Peavey system and practice my speech. And he said, \"Okay, we're going to leave in a few minutes,\" and I realized I didn't have my personal CD player or any of the other accessories that I need for here to give my speech. And so I figured it would be better to delay things and make them wait a little than to get there and be totally unprepared. So I took a paper bag and I dropped in my personal CD player, the mini disk recorder, some cables, my wireless microphone receiver and the wireless microphone itself. And then I was thinking, \"Okay, I'm ready to run out the door.\" And then I realized I don't have the XLR cable to connect the receiver to the board. The wireless microphone receiver connects to the board with an XLR, and I realized I didn't have that so I had to dig it out of my drawer. And also I realized I had to dig out the transformer that powers the wireless microphone receiver. I had to look in a few places and finally I found it and I threw all that in a bag and I was running out the door, and then I realized it was dark out. I had taken most of the day to get this stuff ready. And each time I would put something in the bag, I would turn and run out the door and, I mean, out of my door and halfway down the stairs and realized that I had forgotten one more thing. And I'd come back and I'd put it in and I'd run down half the stairs, and then I was, \"Oh, I forgot one more thing.\" And by the time I was all done with it, it was dark, and we just decided that we would go tomorrow. And then I woke up."

            "content": "Last night I had a very active and interesting dream. I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and Lee and Nikki and probably Jason were all in town again and they were all in our house. And it was like they had all flown in and I think Sheryl and Sandra and I were visiting, and I think we took a walk around the park and everybody but Sheryl ran ahead, and my mother and my father and I and Sheryl were on this walk, and I was -- see, this is a dream within a dream again. I dreamt that I had this dream that Dan O'Brien had given me like a miniature guitar thing as a souvenir from his show; not a real one, but, you know, like a, I guess like a little refrigerator magnet, hang it on your mirror type of thing. It was like on the end of a graduation tassel. And I dreamt that I was telling all this to my father and my mother and Sheryl. And my father was like, \"Now, what would be the point of that?\" And we couldn't convince him because it was a lack of facts. And now that I think of it, I don't think that would be something that he would really think bad about, but in my dream he did. He was going on about, \"What would be the point of that?\" And why in the world would somebody do something like that? But then again, in real life he's always doing insane things that I'd never guess he would, so I guess that's where that would come from. And then suddenly the scene shifted and we were at home, and it was like bedtime because it was like 9:30 or 10:00 at night, and, you know, we think it's bedtime, but they go on hours into the night. So this is the crazy part! Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and me and Nikki were all going to sleep in the same bedroom downstairs, the master bedroom, with my mother and my father. They were all going to sleep in the same room!  And I was going to be up here all nice and peaceful and quiet and everything. And for whatever reason, I took out the mermaid doll and I shoved it under my pillow for some reason, and I was getting adjusted and I heard them all jumping up and down and screaming, laughing, having a good time. So I figure, \"Okay, I'm missing something, so I'll go down there and check it out.\" And Sheryl and Sandra and the guys were kind of wrestling. I don't know where my mother and my father were, but then I realized that I was totally naked and was probably embarrassing everybody but Sheryl and Sandra, and I said, \"Oh, fashion, fashion,\" and they covered kind of my chest. And Sandra took each of my hands in hers and spread them all wide and kind of showed me to them, and was like, \"Yeah, fashion!\"  And that was okay because, of course, it was Sandra. And so then I came back up here again and Sandra and I kind of talked about what, I do not know. And then I was resting again, and then I could overhear my mother was in her workroom and Sheryl was in there talking about how bummed I was because of what my father said about my dream thing. Oh, and Sam and Louise came up here because they wanted to listen to some news in the bedroom, and it didn't work, so they asked if they could turn on mine and I saw, \"Sure.\" So I moved over to the left side of the bed here and I let them sit down on the right side, and I think Nikki was there too. And my radio turned into a TV and they were watching TV and they were watching TV, and I figured, \"Alright, I'm going on the couch.\" So I went on the couch, and that's all I can remember, and then I woke up."

And for some reason I was going on a website that I could look at the results of the Top 40 countdown, and the songs were listed from like 40 to 1 and they had these little icons next to them with pictures that were supposedly the pictures of the CD covers but really had nothing to do with the song. I think that comes from like in Word documents and things, you have a list and you've got these big icons and list information, and it's just all over in your face, which is how I like it. But that's the way it is. I was doing that, and I kind of left it there because I had a feeling that he was going to want to see it. And then I went out in the front yard where they were, and I discovered that Jack and Patti were then sitting, laying in this like silk tent in our front yard. They had like pillows and blankets and sleeping bags and stuff in it, and they were literally camped out in our front yard. And I couldn't figure out why, but this is the really crazy part -- Jack had these butterfly stickers -- not really stickers, but laminated pieces of cardboard with shiny hologram butterflies on them and birds and all kinds of crazy stuff, pictures of bicycles and birds and cars and just stuff, and they were all squares the size of mini disks, and he could slide them into the mini disk player instead of lifting the lid with the latch. He would slide them into to this like a slot, and he had this projector thing in his pants, and he would hold the unit so that the front of it could send an infrared signal to the projector saying it would project it on a screen in my pants! And he was looking at jpeg pictures and seeing these crazy hologram butterflies up on the projector thing, and hearing audio files too, not just through the player, but on a sound system in there and stuff. It was crazy! And then I think I woke up."

            "content": "Okay, last night I had a crazy dream about DBS mainly, which is kind of crazy because I never dream about them. But first in this dream I kind of had the notion that I was riding with my father in the truck in the middle of the night with my bag of stuff and the Peavey system, and we were going on a long, three-hour trip to do a DJ gig somewhere, but I don't actually remember doing the gig. I don't remember coming home, I don't remember where it was, I just know that I was sort of getting ready. Then my mother and I -- I think I do remember getting home from the gig and my mother had to take me to the DBS office to pick up some paper, and they had this big, huge complex, not just a little office in a big building, like they have. And so we walked over there when we got there, and we were just going to pick up the paper and leave, but Carolyn wanted to talk to me. And somebody else did too, so I can't remember anything about what I said, but I think I said, \"Hi, hello,\" to Carolyn. And then there was this other person. She was kind of younger than Carolyn, but she was a little more kind of uppity like, just a little. And we were going around, I don't remember why, but she gave some kind of direction to my mother. They had this like field area out in the back that was for mobility training, and she wanted my mother and I to walk to it. And it was like a street, like a city street, with like just empty fields and nothing on either side. And how that could be anything big for trade, I don't know. And so we started walking down this road and I realized that there were these -- every so often in certain places, there were these like cover things, but they weren't covered, and half was silver and half was black. And when you would step on them, you would get an electric shock because apparently they wanted to do like conditioning to keep you in the middle of the street. And ever so often there would be one on either side, and if you stepped on it, I guess the silver half was the positive and the black half was the negative. I don't know, you'd have to be between the two of them, because you know how that goes. I think I had my white cane with me that time, and even when it would, when my tip would touch it, I would feel it through my hand, which I don't know why because my tip is plastic and the aluminum part is really insulated really well by the rubber top. I don't know, I guess I just wasn't thinking when I created this dream. And so we were going along, and at first I didn't mind, we were walking along and it was kind of pitch dark and we could see where the street was, but sometimes they'd have them in the middle of our path. Then they got to the point where they weren't just every so often. They were like all over, and they were getting bigger with more voltage on them, so it felt stronger. My mother still didn't mind them, so then she was carrying me over some of them, and she was getting them all and she was going, \"Ooh, ah,\" but she didn't mind them. I was like petrified and she kind of didn't care. And there was no like turning back around and going back because this path was like a circle; it would lead you back to the building. We got back to the building and we had to go upstairs for some reason because there was a bathroom in there, and they had you take a shower after you've been on this trip, if people have any feet yet, if they're not black yet. But, you know, the really wild part, after we were on that trip I noticed that there were a few here or there inside the building, and so by that time I was like afraid to take any step in any one direction because these things, I didn't know where the heck they were and when they were going to pop up. And in some cases, when we would be in the hallway, they wouldn't be there, and sometimes they would just pop up, except in the building they wouldn't be black and silver; they would blend in with whatever was around. And so I never did take my shower as prescribed, but I had to go up and down the elevator, which wasn't just for anybody to use. Somebody had to specially activate it for us, so we went down the stairs a few times too, and we noticed how steep the stairs were. So my mother and I had to make a sign that said, \"Beware, drops off.\" And I was kneeling on one stair and laying on the other, and there was the most awful smell on the stairwell, like gym sweat. And somebody was coming up beside us, and I moved over and left them pass, and I finished my sign and then I stuck it up there. And then we went down the stairs, and then, thank goodness, that fiasco was over. Then my dream continues though, we met up with my father at the Coliseum and my mother and my father were conferring outside and I went in and I was giving our information to the person at the desk, like how old am I, how old is the person I'm with, this and that and the other. And it was more like applying for, applying for some kind of government aid just to get into a dance. And the guy said he had a check for me because I had made that long trip and did a Peavey system gig. And so it ended up that I didn't have to pay to get into the dance, but he paid me for something. And so it turned out, just before I woke up, me and my father and my mother, we sat outside in the lobby and were eating some kind of lunch before the dance really got started. Now what I don't understand is when I was on the DBS mobility trail, the ________ mobility trail, I don't understand why it was totally dark outside and here at the Coliseum it was broad daylight. Oh well, that's one of the aspects of the dream. The next dream stems from a lot of things, the first thing being that I always have had something inside of me about covers, but they've always either just popped up or sprayed water or something. I've never had anything electrical going on. I think it's because now, whenever I handle the Peavey system outside, I'm conscious of it. Even this last time I practiced my speech, I was on the sidewalk and everything was dry, and I was still feeling a little bit of something. So I put on my shoes, and, of course, the fears went away, but still I'm more conscious of that now. And also I don't know where DBS comes into the picture; I guess because I'm becoming more independent lately and some people just don't know how independent I can be, not them, but some people I know. And we had to fill out a long, lengthy f___ application so the guy at the Coliseum desk asking me all those question fits in just fine. And he paying me for a Peavey gig is, I guess, because I got several scholarship checks in the mail, and that's the end of that."

And he looked me in the face and he said, \"I'm going to make a deal with you -- you come with me and I'll keep your secret quiet.\" I guess I kind of like bit his hand and he let me go and I went in the store. I was supposed to meet up with my mother and I never did, and then I met up with her eventually. And then the TV people, some news people were calling me because they wanted me to go on TV for half an hour and talk about what had happened.

All I remember now about this dream was that I was having my whole room, my studio, repainted, and not just that, but we were having the kitchen and I think the stairwell and the studio repainted, maybe even my mother's room. And some things were all messed up and turned upside down and messed around, and you know how it is. And I was in my room here, and they had just finished repainting it, and it was twice the size that it usually is, I think because when we were repainting it when I was 16 just before my birthday, we did repaint it, and it was like, it looked twice the size when all the shelves and everything were out, and my desk was out because it was being repainted. And anyway, I came in and they were starting to move furniture back in, in my studio after the paint job, and my desk was like big and black and the top was wooden, but the bottom was like plastic, you know how modern things are. And on my south wall there was this cart with like a ton of books on the bottom and a ton of CD's on the top, and it was like real ____ and said that it came from like a friend who was cleaning out the closet. And I could go through their CD's and books and keep any of the ones that I wanted for like DJ stuff. And so I started looking through them in a very orderly manner, and I laid a few on the side that looked like good party mixes that I was going to put on and listen to once my sound system was back together, because only furniture, but nothing else, was in there at this point. And then my father came in when I had like two or three laid aside, and he was saying something like, \"Do you think you can put all this stuff back together?\" meaning the sound system and all the equipment. And he said, \"Then after you do that, you can resume and maintain your privacy,\" or something like that, and I said, \"Sure, I think I can do that.\" So even though it was like a monumental task -- not only the sound system, but the mixer and the computer and everything was like all, all the components and everything were just laid out on my bed. And he was like, \"I think that attempt is going to fail. I know it's going to fail.\" And then I woke up."

Anyway, I dreamt that I had to take three more classes at my college this summer and they were going to be like theory classes and like fun stuff, almost like art classes. And I was deciding which ones they would be. And I dreamt that my father had this, either a violin or a dulcimer or a mandolin or something that he found either at a garage sale or in the dumpster, and he taught himself to play it. I can't remember what song it was, but he was trying to teach himself, \"Oh Shenandoah.\" And he was also, he knew \"This Land is Your Land,\" and I was feeling his fingers and how they were moving while he was playing it, and I was thinking, \"Wow, isn't this cool? I thought he would never learn such a thing.\" And he was going to teach me, but I was kind of embarrassed at first, I don't know why. And this dream mostly consisted of those notions, and sitting out in the front yard and watching my father play his instrument, whatever it was. And then I was in this big yellow room again and my mother was asking me what kind of classes was I going to take. And I remember she was saying it was okay if I took an online class, because I think I've still got it in the back of my head that I would rather take that music theory class than speech because it's an online thing.

It was like a semi-big like private sailboat or something, and it had these tight quarters inside the cabin, and we were going up to the second floor of the cabin for some reason. And something was wrong with the boat, and in order to get it repaired, the man who was out on the boat with us had to go up to the second floor of the cabin, which you just kneel and you couldn't stand up in the second floor of the cabin. And he had to lay down in this bed that he could just barely fit in, meaning because it was so tight and so low. And there were these bright lights that they had to turn on inside this little bed cubicle, right on the man. And this lady had to ask him questions about what was wrong with the boat under these bright lights and then she could finally fix it. But while this was going on we heard a big boom down in the lower part of the boat, and we were like, \"Oh, my gosh, we have to get off.\" And I was wondering if I could out of the upper floor of the cabin because it was so tight, and somehow I managed to get onto the deck.

Last night I was dreaming that I had to take all my equipment up to my relative's home town, not just my mixer and my CD recorder, but my receiver and a DVD player and everything. It was like I was going to be really weighed down. And I think it was because somebody wanted me to do a gig when I got up there or something. And so I was setting things up in the living room on a little table as kind of a test run, and I had the mixer and I had a VCR that I had to connect to it, and I also had my CD recorder, and I also had, I think, a DVD player. And I was trying to figure out how in the heck was I going to connect all three of these things when I already had two sets of RCA inputs, and I could use adaptors for the other one.

Oh no, Sheryl and another girl and me and probably Sam were up in the bedroom up here, and we had the twin beds, like we had in the old days.

She's kind of like estranging herself from the family somehow because she thinks we're not going to accept her for who she is.

Now we know the Media Building is the building that is pretty much open air except for the classroom and has a really icky stupid elevator.  Well, in my dream I was coming out of one of the classrooms of the Media Building and I was racing down the like hallway on the second floor to get to like the stairs or the elevator so I could get down because somebody was waiting to pick me up. And part of the building was under construction, and in my dream it was a lot bigger than it actually was, and I was running down the hall and I came to this little metal gap, like, you know, how you get gaps in concrete, so I kind of stepped over that. And then it was like an obstacle course. There were like rubber mats, little pools and things, screws, there was concrete that was all torn apart and several layers and levels that I was stepping down, instead of just going down the stairs. I came to this area that there's a monument at the green point, that's like a point in two triangles touching each other, and well, this building under construction had one of those and I was standing underneath it, and I was standing in a puddle of water and I was starting to see lightning. And I thought, \"Oh, my gosh, I'm standing in a thing that's metal and I'm ankle deep in water. I'm really scared here.\" I wasn't hearing any thunder; I was just seeing flashes. And so I climbed onto, you know how when you do construction, the windows aren't in and you've got like big gaps, I jumped onto one of the window gaps and I was sitting where the window was supposed to go, yelling for help from one of the construction workers. And I had the feeling that one of them was coming to get me, but instead, my mother showed up with the car. She pulled it right up into a dirt mound, got me, and I woke up before we could go anywhere. And that's that. Well, for one thing, I've been having a lot of stress lately, and it seems to be going away now that things have evened off, but I've just been having tons of emotional roller coaster rides, I guess you could say, because I've been really, really, really happy one minute and either tired or disappointed about something the next. And I guess before things started evening off today, I was feeling like I wasn't sure if I was going to get all my stuff done on time. So that could be where I felt like I was in such a dangerous situation portrayed in the dream. Now the other things are just kind of things that played in there, like the construction is still going on across the street, and fortunately I haven't had to go snooping in there lately. Let's see, I don't think there's any buildings at my college that are like the Media Building, but there is an icky elevator in the Language Arts Building that I don't really have the nerve to go on. I never thought I would be like that until Elizabeth brainwashed me into being afraid of elevators that aren't quite right. And, of course, we know about my mother with the car. She's the knight in shining armor once again because she's going to take me off to a bunch of fun things real soon, and she always comes and gets me out of these things in real life, emotionally more than physically. And that's just that."

            "content": "I was having a really neat dream last night, one of the best organized, I think, that I've had in a while. Usually when I have dreams about birthday parties and Christmases and opening presents, everything is real vague and kind of distant. That's kind of one of the reasons immediately I know that it's a dream because it is so vague and distant. But this time I had a dream that I was having an early birthday party with Sheryl and Sandra and Sam, so that we could celebrate with them before we went to my relative's home town, we could celebrate up there, then we could celebrate when we get back on the actual day. And for some reason Sheryl, Sandra and Sam have been showing up in my dreams a lot lately. And we were in the living room and I was opening some presents. The first, I got some books for my birthday, meaning in my dream, and I can't remember exactly what they all were, but one of them was, it looked and smelled like the copy of A Tale of Two Cities that we got from the library, but it was some other French title by some person. And it was supposed to be one of the most profound things in literature, but I was like, I don't think so. Then I got this other book from my father that was like a small, about the average size of a paperback, but a little thinner, and it was supposed to be this quarterly journal like type thing about sound and stuff. And it was kind of brown and old looking, and it had yellow print on the cover that said, \"How to Take Amplifier Wattage and Apply It to Speaker Power,\" I think is what it said, something like that. And I'm thinking, \"Okay, do they have to have such a thick volume on such a topic? I mean, not just stuff in general, but specifically that. And I started flipping through it and it was tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny print and there was a subscription card in the back, and I was thinking how it wasn't a really a big deal that it was in tiny print because I have a CC TV. And then I got the biggest present of all. Now in my dream all these presents were wrapped in the same kind of wrapping paper, that kind of like rosish wrapping paper that I used for my mother's TV. This present was so big that it could pass for a piece of equipment, you know, like the average size that the average box comes in that you get? Well, it was that size and I ripped it open, all excited, thinking it was going to be something like that. And it was a box, a gourmet box of chocolate-covered cherries that was just huge. I was feeling kind of a little bit let down, but yet a little excited at the same time because I was kind of expecting something else.  And then as this dream goes on, it got really cool. The mermaid doll that I have, you know how it just duh duh duh duh.  I don't know what I'm saying, but you know how that is. Well, I dreamt that I found the little bag that it came in and there were these magnets, like refrigerator magnets, that you had to install, like you had to glue them to the battery compartment door so that either to make them hold the charge longer or to make them do something else. I think it was to make them do something else, but these could have not been magnets. They were either magnets or chips that you had to glue in a certain place on the door, and I was trying to figure how to do this and I didn't know if you were supposed to glue them to the door or the side of the thing. So I was trying to find the instructions to figure that out, and there was this big, thick book that was like newsprint, like the SPC catalog, and it was yellow on the front and it had little pictures in it. And it was all these things that this company makes. It was like an exquisite ______ illusion company, for lack of a better term. But they made imaginative things that you would use in displays and setups that were based on movies, like for \"The Little Mermaid\" they had two or three other models similar to my doll, and they had a whole bunch of other things that were different things, like Arabian figures and stuff. And they had this other mermaid with a purple fin, purple shells and blonde hair, and I was writing down the catalog number because that's another thing that I would want for my birthday. And then I woke up. That was messed up, man. That's all I can say about that."

But you know how my mother is, she diddles and she daddles and she doddles and she doodles, and we didn't get out of the house until 9:30, so we had to take, I mean we had to reschedule to the 10:05 flight. Now in my dream the way it worked is, it would be just like a bus, you catch whichever one you can catch, but you know in life it doesn't work that way. And so we were at the airport getting ready for this flight, and I think we were shopping around in a few of those little stores that they have, and I can't remember a whole lot, but something happened that made us miss that one too. I think we couldn't get on it because our bags were too big, and we had to take one that left at 2:30. And I think before I woke up, we were finally on that flight, but we weren't really going to get into town until 7:30 at night, which really we're getting there at like 6:00, or no, we're getting there at 4:45, but we probably won't get to Christine's house until 6:00. But in my dream we wouldn't even land until 7:30, and I was thinking, \"Oh, my gosh, what a terrible chain of domino effects this was -- diddle doddle, diddle doddle, and we didn't get out until late. Oh, my gosh.\" And that's really all there is to it. Although this dream has its literal implications about us getting on a plane and all, I think this dream referred more to life and what I feel I'm missing out on. I guess I just feel like now my dependence will never disappear, and what I could miss out on and that I might finally get to my destination, but it might be much later in life than I had hoped. So that's that."

And I was at a regular desk in the back of the room, and my mother was there, and when I got my book she was going to go outside with me so we could read it, and the teacher directed me to do that. That's what me and Elizabeth used to do. And when we got outside there were these big bumps in front of the building that I almost tripped over, and that I was crawling over so I could really feel how they were going. And then we got to a picnic table where we were going to take the test, and my mother was bringing out food and drinks and picnic stuff and we're picnicking and talking about everything under the sun, except doing the test. And I'm telling her, \"Come on, come on, I gotta take this test. I don't know when the period's going to end, but I have to take the test.\" But she said, \"You have extra time; don't worry.\" And I think that was that, and then I woke up.

And so I went into this, we were riding with my mother, he and I were on a tandem and we rode down to this pizza place and we sat ourselves down at a table and my father had brought two tuxedos -- one with a straight like scoop neck and one with a flowery, flowery whoo neck. And both of these were like men's clothes that were like way too big for me, but I was supposed to wear one of them for the interview. And the person came for me before I had a chance to put them on, and we did the interview. She asked a couple questions. She asked more questions than I offered information. Usually when I've done interviews with the internship program, I try to offer information like so they don't have to ask everything and drag it out of me. But I let them drag it out of me this time.  And I had to sign a form, which is like signing a statement in court, but they said I had to assent to the fact that I had a disability and I had to sign a form to do that. And then she asked some more questions, and then I went into another room where I was supposed to fill out an application, and there were these people sitting at these tables and somebody had this long involved math problem, and I took out a pencil out of my bag and I just took a shot at trying to solve it.

I didn't do that when I came from Bancroft and went to my high school, so I don't know what's going on here. But I was in the Media Building at my high school, but I was taking a class in one of the rooms like I would take at my college. And I was up on the third floor and I was with some other people. They weren't like young people, but some of them were and some of them were like middle-aged older people. And class was kind of ending and everybody was just kind of sitting down and shuffling their books and stuff. And the fire alarm went off outside. You know how you don't hear it in the room, but then you hear it outside in the hallway? Well, all of us took our good old time packing up our stuff. Apparently we knew it was just a drill or they were like testing it or something. So we took our good old time -- that's kind of crazy. And so -- oh, I know -- by the time we were ready to walk out the door, everybody had their stuff because we had to like go all together and we had to wait for everybody to pack their stuff. Well, when everybody had their stuff, the alarm shut itself off, and so I had this immense fear going on that it was going to happen again while we were out in the hallway and it was going to be terrible. And dragging my book bag and stuff, and we can't really just go down the stairs because something is blocked or something, so we've got to go down these big ladder things and then walk across these like levels of concrete and then go down more big ladders and stuff. And we were all doing this with our stuff, and we got out to the, they had a bus circle at this place, and we were out to the bus circle and I thought I had missed my bus. So I was hopping a van with a lady and a couple of kids and they lived near me apparently and they were going to take me home. This van was a black van, if that makes any difference. And out there it looked like my high school. And as I was in the van, somebody said, \"Well, you could take the bus. Your bus is still here. You can take the bus if you want.\" And I don't remember if I was on the bus or in the van coming home, but in my dream you had buses -- school buses -- to and from my college also."

So my mother and my father went their way and Sheryl, Sandra and I -- no, I think my mother and Sheryl and Sam and I went through the school part and we were like going around peeking in these different windows, and when we would come to an exit door, it would have a little tiny sound coming from the exit like box.

But, let's see, I don't remember really entering, but P_________ assigned some kind of teacher to be my mentor, and I think she was a private school teacher who taught there some times. And I was walking through the building and my mother and the teacher were going to take care of some other kind of business, and while we were all sitting in this big auditorium, somebody knocked a purse over of this girl, and spilled all her change on the floor, and so they were going to pick it up and put it back in the purse for her. And this place was very well lit. It had carpet on the floor most places, and it didn't have all those crazy colors on the floor like I remember when I actually went to the building a few years ago. And I was walking around, and there was sound everywhere, but I couldn't actually get close enough to see where it was coming from. I was like in a kitchen when I re-met up with my mother and the teacher, and I had to practice making a sandwich or finding things because that's what I was going to have to do, and this was a little pookie kitchen and it had like practically nothing in, that I was supposed to work in. But before that, when I was trying to work in the pookie kitchen, there was somebody messing with the sound system in like the middle of a foyer thing, setting up like a Peavey system type thing, and I couldn't go check it out because I was confined to the pookie kitchen. And then my mother and the teacher showed up again, and we ran into Ms. Fletcher, and she was saying how some bank screwed her all up for some reason, and we walked along and we went to another kitchen, except this kitchen was full of books. It was full of like kiddie books, and there was another little closet that was dark and probably had some stuff in it, but I didn't go in there. And then all of a sudden we were at the house and the teacher lady was sitting down and relaxing and I was sitting next to her and we were talking about things. And there were these boys that were being real boisterous at the house and they were having this party, and one of them sat down on her lap and was kind of faking a lap dance.

But my father and my mother and I were like in a connecting airport, but we were outside on this deck and looking over like a roof into the city. And this thing was like a floating deck dock thing. It was like flying on air and it was like trampoline. We were jumping up and down on a trampoline. And in my dream my father and I were holding hands and were like trampoline jumping back to the main terminal, which was like about ten foot square on the deck, and my mother was over in a chair by the main terminal. And I was thinking how trampoline jumping might bring back a bunch of scary stuff if we do too many maneuvers, but that wasn't a part really that much of it.

Well, that's how this thing was. It was a vehicle with wings and the windshield was open and the windows were open, and it was like, it wasn't really a plane at all; it was a car.

That was crazy! And so we had one of these little setups in our living room so that I could practice doing it, and I had a feeling like I wanted to get up on a stool thing and speak to those people, but I had no idea what the heck I wanted to say.

It was supposed to like dance, but when he spread his arms, it was like this big, huge mess, just swaying and swaying and kind of making a noise and flashing some lights and playing a little Christmas song. But I would get nervous about this thing falling off because it would sway so wide, and I didn't really think it was going to fall off, I just thought it might. And that's really all I can remember. I think I was going to take it to a party or something, but I don't remember anything.... Now I remember some more about this dream. It had no connection to the Santa thing, but I dreamt that we were walking from an apartment in N______ Park over to the campus, and it was sort of a nice walk. I mean, we were seeing roses and stuff. But I was living upstairs in kind of a dingy place, and it was kind of small and blah, and so we were on this walk, showing me the way to my tech school, and next thing I know, I'm back home at this house messing with that Santa thing again. I don't get it."

And it didn't really have an address because it didn't stay in one place; it could get up and go at any minute. And I was thinking to myself how I would really like to stay at a place that was on land, and I wouldn't want to stay on a ship. And there was another part to this dream. There was a waiter guy who had to come to my room in order to get to either the ship's bathroom or like a kitchen storehouse place, but he came through there a couple times, and he ended up sleeping in my bed. And in my dream I didn't really consciously think he did anything to me, but I kind of asked my mother that, if I needed to get an abortion, would she be able to take me in, not let anybody know. And I don't remember what she said, but next thing I knew, we were on a smaller boat just going for a ride with a bunch of people. And then I woke up."

I dreamt that I think I might have been at either Aunt Christine's house or at some other strange house. But I had a feeling like it was somebody's house that I had just been to the first time. And I didn't really know the people, and they had like an upper second story, and they had a living room real similar to ours. And then they had a cellar and the stairs are just like ours except they were a lot less steep, they went at a much more gradual grade for a much longer period of distance. And I had to go get something from in their cellar, and, oh no, I think I had to go to the bathroom down there. And what you had to go is you had to go down the steps, and then there was like a hallway, and to your right was a bathroom, to the left was some other kind of junk room, and if you kept going straight and down a couple more steps, you'd have an even deeper, darker cellar. And by the way, in all of this, there was one light switch at the head of the stairs that controlled the lights for all three of those rooms down there and the stairway. And I had to go to the bathroom and somebody was in the first story bathroom, and I was going down the stairs of the cellar, and it didn't actually happen, but I was having a vision of what would happen if somebody were to see the door open and the light on, and they just switched off the switch and everything went dark, how I would just scream! And after that thought, I decided I wasn't going to go to the bathroom down there, that I was going to hold it some more. So then I woke up, and I really had to go."

And then I must have been roaming around my high school or something, in the hall in front of the Guidance Office, and I heard them announcing the final exam schedule for my college over the intercom. And I was thinking how the high school students, they threaten them and they say, \"If you don't get your exam by the scheduled time, the door's going to be locked and you won't get to.\" And they just say, \"First period, second period, go to your next period exam.\" But at my college, when they read their exam schedule, they were a lot more, not really empathetic, but sort of along that line, trusting that the college students would know what the heck they were doing.

And we were going around downtown and doing stuff, and there was some kind of exhibit show in the Coliseum and we were walking around. And then there was supposed to be a Celine Dion concert like the Las Vegas show, and apparently because it wasn't making too much money up there, it had to tour and it had to come down and go to another place. And so I was thinking, \"Oh, man, we don't even have to pay 80 bucks to get it; we're already in.\" And my mother's like, \"Well, I don't know, we've got people to go do stuff with and we don't know what they're doing and what their plans are\" and stuff. And so we went outside and we started walking down the road and then I found out that my mother and my father had bought two tickets for the concert for Christmas for me, and so we went back in, and my mother kept stalling and stalling doing different things, and finally we got in and we got to our seats. And this heavy metal guitar person opened for her, and then when it was her turn to come out and take the stage, they pulled down a movie screen and I found out it wasn't going to be a concert. They were going to show a horror movie that she starred in. And I was like, \"What!?\""

And there were a bunch of people that I didn't really know, but I felt were friendly, and they were like people I think I was trying to get to know, like college age people. And I dreamt that in my Basic Electronics class, when we passed the final exam, we were given a little card that said that you were like a certified basic person, basically. And it was shaped just like my Best Buy gift card and it had the hologram on the front, and the crAnthonytials were printed on the back. And it had a little tiny picture of the music major down in the lower left-hand corner of the back, and a little further like in the middle of the card there was a little tiny picture of like a UPC symbol on the bottom right. And I was sitting kind of in a big roly chair looking at something that was kind of a combination of a computer and a CC TV. And I put this card under my tray and I was looking at it, and three boys and two girls all around were like, \"Oh wow, cool, you actually got one of these cards. Oh, my gosh!\" And there was this big dog, but she was real friendly. I had a feeling it was a she; I don't remember what they were calling her, but she was big. Her shoulders came up to my chest. She liked to kind of make it so that my hand's looped in her collar, and she would pull my chair along with her as she walked. And she pulled me back a little bit."

I had a black tube that was about three feet long, and it was about, it had two speakers attached to it kind of taped on with electrical tape at either end of the tube. And there were wires in the middle of the tube that connected them, and in the middle of this, that would come up from the tube vertically like a T, and on top of that I was going to put some kind of a -- like a control unit like type thing, like -- I don't know -- a crazy box. I don't know what it was supposed to do, but I wanted to rig it so that there was like a display that I wanted to rig on the outside of the tube, and I was soldering these wires all together so the thing would work. And I took the control box and I laid it face down on the bed, and I had this little bin of fasteners and I had this soldering iron that was about as heavy as a drill, and it was sort of, it had a wide, round tip that had a little boop in the center, and it had the solder within it instead of on a separate little thing. And what you would do is you would heat it up and you'd tip it upside down on the tip, and you would dab a little bit on and it would melt and you'd stick on whatever you wanted to stick on while it was still liquid. And I had these fasteners that were wires with little round tips at the end, so I was laying them in the thing, laying them in the blob of solder that I put on the terminals, and when I was done with this iron thing, I would like lay it on the bed. And worse yet, I would lay it on a newspaper on the bed. And when I woke up, I thought, \"Oh, my gosh, why the heck would I do something like that?\" And there were these two boys just watching what I was doing, and they were kind of jiggling and jury-rigging the wires inside this tube.

It was my mother and me and Terri that was there. And they were like, there was like a DJ and they were playing different CD's and stuff. Then we went to like the second level. In this particular stadium there were like where the, down on the field where most of the booths were, then there was a second level where some other -- it was like a thin little circle of fields that was a second level where other displays and booths were that were around. And we went back into a hall because we were looking for the bathroom. We found this audio booth where this girl was mixing, and I thought I used to know her. She reminded me of Charity, the neighbor down the street, but I didn't know who she was in my dream. She was doing the mixing and stuff, and she was waiting for her next shift to come, and nobody else wanted to take over for her and she was kind of upset that nobody would take over for her. Terri, she asked if Terri would take over for her, and Terri was like, \"Nah, I don't do that kind of stuff.\" And I had to cut in between in, I kind of waved my hand like you do in school, and waved it and shouted and cut in between them, and I said, \"I would be happy to take over for you if you teach me how to run your system.\" And fortunately -- you know how like a band plays and then there's like a lull when they take a break -- well, fortunately I guess DJ's don't take breaks, but it was sort of a break phase while she was teaching me. This room that the equipment was in kind of put me to mind of the Double Vision room, and as much video equipment as they had in the Double Vision room, this was all audio equipment. She took me like from one thing to the next and like put my hand on it, and I was able to feel the front panel on each device, and I was able to sort of know what it is. I don't remember the most important thing. They did not have a mixer.  Shame on them! But had three CD's players. The first and the second one, 10 or 12 knobs across the front that were supposed to be like EQ things, and then they had the usual transport controls underneath the tray. And then they had a third CD player that was like a cream-colored personal CD player. Then they had two other weirdo things that I've never seen before. Oh, and then they had like tons of CD's, but I don't remember a mixer or an amplifier. How in the heck are we supposed to mix without a mixer? But anyway, I remember wishing that I had brought my magnifier so that I could at least try to read some of the titles, because after she left and she said like, \"It's all yours,\" I think my mother and Terri went to do something else. And I was just taking time to look through their collection and see what I could see. And they had tapes of stuff that you listened to that was recorded, books and stuff, and they had CD's that were kind of blah, but the good stuff that she was playing I couldn't find. I wasn't looking in the right place. And I felt like I was doing a terrible mix because I wasn't playing stuff that was appropriate for the crowd because I didn't know what I was going to queue up because I couldn't read the darned things and I didn't, like with my collection I know what's where. Well, this one I just had no clue. And then we were home -- man, I'm using up tape like crazy -- we were at home watching movies, and I think it was \"Brother Bear\" with sort of a crazy spin on it and when the movie ended, I think for some reason the amplifier was in the middle of the foyer with no wires attached to it. But I could still turn the volume down on the front and the volume would still go down and it would still control things. That was crazy! And I was picking up all these lettuce leaves off the couch, and I was putting them into this green container and crying for some reason. And these lettuce leaves had to go back to Block Buster with the movie, why I do not know. But my father was like, \"Are you crying like the Toyota?\" And I was like, \"No, I've got a stuffy nose and I always breathe like that when I have a stuffy nose.\" And then I woke up."

And there was, then the circle, they disbanded from the circle and they would take turns singing and all. Their accompanist was at a grand piano, and the keys weren't out lateral, they were like typewriter keys, all sort of on top of each other. And the guy, all the kids finished performing and the guy was like trying to tune it or something and he had the lid lifted, and there was fire. There was a different color flame for each note and for different chords the different flames had to sort of mix.  That was so messed up, man. I don't know where that came from. But then the next scene was that I was at like a beach thing. I think it had something to do with a scholarship convention, and I was swimming with my mother. It started off to be that I was at a boat ramp and my mother and I sort of strayed from the band and people that were there, and we started swimming. And the first weird thing was that there was a boat coming and we didn't want to get run over and so he's like, \"Come on down,\" we've got to get under the water so that this boat can go over us. And so we went under, and I was able to breathe under water because apparently there was a little air pocket that sort of came down with us, you know how things get. And then when we came up again, I noticed that we were two-thirds of the way across this bridge that was like, I don't know, fifteen or twenty feet long that was supposed to be the skyway, but it was too small to be the skyway. We were swimming to this little island, and my mother wanted to go in this little pet store and get food for the people's dog that we were staying with, but I was swimming naked and I didn't want to get out of the water, so I waited for her. And I started swimming back across the thing by the bridge, and on the other side there was like a turtle, and I touched the turtle, and then he immediately wanted to bite me. And I threw handfuls of sand at him so he would bite the sand and not me and I could get away. But he kept following me, following me, following me, and finally I just forgot about it and I went up on top of this bridge and I forgot all about the fact that I had been swimming naked, and they were like giving out like scholarship awards at this little pavilion. And I knew I was supposed to be one of them and I hoped that my mother would come over from the pet store in time. And I think that was it."

You should have everything all set _____ the way you wanted to.\" And so we set up so that we could have a reception at the Hilton, and then about a little while later he reminded that it was still set up and that it couldn't be cancelled because I wasn't really starting to get to know him, like he wasn't returning my calls and stuff. And he reminded me that time was running out to get to know him, and I just said, \"Okay, enough of this.\" I ___________, but in my dream I did a bunch of crying and then finally I went to them and said, \"Look, I'll give you the money that it takes to cancel the thing, but I want you to cancel it.\" And then he was like, \"Well, you were the one that set it up,\" and this and that, and I was thinking, \"No, I didn't. You were the one that made me.\" And I think there was something else. I think my mother had found this really small premie baby and picked it up, sort of like you pick up a hurt bird and take it home and take care of it. So she sort of picked it up, it was abandoned, and she brought it home, and then we had a baby in the house, plus all this other stuff going on. And, oh yeah, one other additional part to this dream: I dreamt that I was at some kind of class that was teaching me how to do something technical. I think I was at a thing that was sort of a cross between a CC TV and a computer, and I don't remember what I was doing, but she was trying to get a feel for how much I knew. I was working with this lady, and I was kind of going off and thinking about my own thing, and I wasn't able to do what I was supposed to do.

I can't remember exactly what they were, but they were kind of juicy things that somehow I could use. They were kind of like utilitarian gifts.

I dreamed that I was raising and hatching these baby chicks; there were about five or six of them, and I had eggs in an incubator.

And it was like a f______ project, and I seem to remember the chickies coming out, and there were three yellow ones, a brown one and two black ones. And, you know, they were hopping around doing their thing, and I was thinking, \"Oh, how cute! I can take these to the fair and show them.\" And then, I can't remember, something else was going on. Some elderly woman took me to this big, open hall type thing, and there was tons of stuff going on; I can't remember exactly what. But when I came back, I realized that the black chickie had run away, something happened to the brown one, and the three yellow ones had died because I forgot to feed them anything before I left for the big, open hall. I think I had given the brown one away, the black one ran away and the three yellow ones had died. And I'm so disappointed and so heart-broken that here I let these chickies just die because I didn't feed them, I didn't have a chance to feed them or get them any of that baby chick starter stuff before I went to the big, open hall thing. And that's when I woke up. And the funny thing about this dream is that the next day we went to a garden-like place, and there was a frog right by a little map sign thing, and I used to pick up frogs all the time and put them in my pocket. But then a couple years ago I started getting really grossed out when I touched them. But this time I just picked up that frog like I used to do when I was little, and held it in my hand for a few minutes and let it go. And I was appreciating its creature-hood, if you know what I mean. And I was glad that this creature didn't end up like the baby chicks in my dream."

The first thing I can remember clearly is that I had a math class at my college with a lady professor, and she was talking to us about how math is heavenly, but it's a cold heaven and it takes like, it keeps your mind thinking reason and logic and all that stuff. And I'm thinking, \"Yeah, right, lady.\" And I had this, you know how in high school they had a book which had like two and a half pages each night? Well, that's kind of how this was, except it was like two facing pages was our assignment. And the first problem kind of read like this, \" Carl bought five milliliters of ice cream, a cone, a rong (spelled r-o-n-g) and an equal = sign and a summation sign + 9 milliliters. So apparently you had to figure out how many milliliters in a cone and then add up the cone and the five and then figure out what the rong was. And then the rest of the problem was he was buying all this other food, like pizza with chicken on it and burgers with bacon, and you were supposed to know like how much it cost or how many calories it was without any other information. And I had a whole page of these to do and I was just starting to think about the first one. And next thing I knew, we were up in my relative's home town and my mother and I were like on a vacation, and I had all these problems to do on my vacation. And I think we were at Grammy's house first, downstairs, sort of getting settled and all. And we were waiting for Aunt Christine and Uncle Larry to come over, and my mother wanted to go up the stairs into Grammy's attic to get like her sewing or something that was up there. And so she turned on the light on the stairwell and we went up, and then she turned on the light in that first big main room where everything is, and she started digging around, rooting around, and believe it or not, I was kind of afraid to go too far into that room, but I was afraid to go back down the stairs because she had turned off the light in the stairwell, and it was dark downstairs in the house. So I'm like sitting there, or I'm like standing there on the first step, gripping the wall post molding thing between the stairwell and the room, and focusing on the light in the room, but gripping that molding thing so tight so that I wouldn't fall down the steps. And just waiting for her to just root around and spend all day and do do do do do do. And then I don't remember us going down, but next thing I knew, we were in Aunt Christine's cellar in her game room and the light was on by Bobby's pool table. And the room was much bigger than it really is. And Christine and Larry and Uncle Bob were in that room talking about making some kind of salad for dinner, and I felt bad that we must have woke up Uncle Bob somehow because, you know, he goes to sleep really early. And I wanted to go up to Uncle Larry and say \"Hi,\" but I didn't want to hang around too much and look dorky because, see, he just got the b___________ in real life, and in my dream I remembered that. And I didn't want to act like I was too anxious to hear it. I wanted to act normal like I was anxious to see him. But I didn't want to be too anxious, you know how that goes. And fortunately it ended on a happy note like that, and then I sort of woke up. Man, I can't tell you what all that's about. But I can say that we've been listening to Springstein lately while we've been doing major cleaning projects around the house. Yesterday I ran my sound system instead of having my mother run her Bose machine because hers is in her room kind of facing north, and mine has more power and it's sort of got more force behind it and it can just face right out the open door into my bedroom where we were working. So I blasted it and the whole time I was thinking about Christine and Larry and how carefree they are up there, and how I wish we could be back up there, no matter how snowy it is still at this time of year. And I think the math has to do with that I know that there are college math classes, and that I can't imagine myself being able to keep my sanity having one. And it was all I could do to get __________, and in this dream I was just sort of visualizing myself not being able to finish my homework and having these terrible test scores and everything I already went through in high school. And maybe it symbolizes like the stuff I'm having to go through now; I don't know."

But I think the first scene had to do with me being at my college and going to take a more advanced electronics class there. Well, first of all, the most clearest thing in my mind is I was with this guy who kind of acted like Andrew, and he was showing me that if you constructed this little round decorative thing out of metal, and you mount it on a sort of a metal plate, that there's holes in the metal plate that you put, that you attach a chain to. And you attach this chain and then you can chain it. And I think that he sent me to, it was my mother and I and we rode with him in this little golf cart down this path with these little Jane bready houses around it, and that was supposed to be the my college campus. And we came to the office of the man that I really wanted to talk to, but before he was there, we had some time to wait, so my mother and I kind of took off and we went to -- I can't remember where we went -- but I think we went to some kind of CD store or something, some place to shop, I think. And now it gets kind of fuzzy from there. But then I remember coloring some cards. They, I can't really explain what was on them, but you know how when I first look at a black and white thing, I can't tell what in the heck it is until I look at little parts of it and put it together? Well, it was like, it was in the \"I don't know what the heck it is\" stage, and I never put it together. I was trying to, but I could never make sense of them. I was just coloring all kinds of crazy colors . And what else? [yawn] Then we were in this store and somebody was having a wedding and they were looking at tablecloths and party supplies and pink napkins, and I was thinking, \"Oh cool, if there's some pink napkins left over, I can get them and use them as pink stuffing or something.\" And we were looking at white lacy tablecloths and stuff and I think we were enjoying _______,"

I dreamt that I was back at my high school helping Mrs. Dougherty with some kind of play that they were doing. And in addition to her, they had another voice teacher, that I think was Ms. Burton. She was taller and a little chunkier, and she was wearing blue and Mrs. Dougherty was wearing black. And apparently the kids liked Ms. Burton better, but I thought she was kind of boring, and the kids liked her better because she was kind of boring. She wasn't as vocally insightful, I guess you would say. She just went through the motions and tried to be a person. And I was helping them in the auditorium with s_______ and stuff, and I can't really remember too good, but I was mostly just standing around. And then we had to take a bus to a portable, and the bus drove us around the campus and drove us up into the portable, and drove us around in the portable until it found a place to park. And then it was just Mrs. Dougherty's class in this portable, and I had written two songs and she wanted me to give them to people to stand up and sing. And the one I had a written was a concept that I would rather be there to experience it, even though there was some stress. And I wasn't given ______ anything basically, and that song was about when I was in her class in high school. And the person couldn't really read my handwriting, so I was having to sing some of the words along with them, just so they could get through it. And then next thing I know my mother and I are walking with her out by like a bus circle. It looked like Bancroft's bus circle, but it was still at my high school, if you could imagine that. And she was talking about like sewing and stuff, and then we got out there and my mother stops. Apparently there was an alarm box out there that had like corrosion and stuff all over it, and my mother stopped and it was like, \"I told them about this. I don't know why they're not doing anything about it.\" So she goes to the office and I'm out there with Mrs. Dougherty in the bus circle and I think my father is there at that time, and I'm asking him, \"Is the alarm going to go off?\" and he won't ask me. So I figure out what that means. And so I run through the parking lot bus area and up onto this grassy medium that's got bushes and stuff so that I'm away from the building, and at that time I realize that I'm totally naked and I'm laying down and I've got a towel. I cover my head with the towel and I'm just laying there, all these bushes and stuff. And then my mother comes back and I call her over, and I tell her I need my clothes. And then I realize that there's a hotel above the school where we've been staying and that's where all my clothes are. And I find the clothes and then my father shows up, and we're waiting and waiting and waiting, and they make an announcement on the intercom that the alarm might go off without warning. So I'm laying there with a towel over my head and I sort of heard it, but I put my clothes on and then I lay back in that position. And then there's a bench in front of us and they're unpacking all kinds of yogurt and juice and stuff, and they're picnicking out. And I sort of get less uptight because it hadn't gone off yet and it's been quite a while, and then I woke up."

Well, first of all I dreamt that I was back at my high school, kind of at like a summer school camp thing, and the transition students from the Wilcox Center were all there at this camp thing. I don't know why I keep having dreams about being back at my high school. I just don't get it! We were like doing a like a tour or some kind of a PE thing, and there was like this courtyard thing that we were all one. And we were like walking around the school and then coming back to the courtyard. The fire alarm system went off while we were out there, and, of course, it wasn't too terrible because we were out in the middle of a big space between a bunch of the buildings and things. And we were already out, so there was no reason to go running in either. I don't remember it was, whether it was just sort of a fluke or what. All the buildings it had shut off in except for the gym. The PE teacher was Alisha Wolf and she was going to take us in that gym no matter what. Yeah, it was still sounding in the gym, but she was going to take us in there anyway. And we were lining up getting ready to go in there. And you know how at my high school the Media Building and everything over in that area was like twice as bad as the other buildings. Well, the gym was like that too. And I was getting ready to skip class and run off somewhere, so I would have done anything except going into that gym while that alarm was sounding. And I couldn't believe that the PE person was going to take us in there anyway. But as we were going in there, it just seemed to get quieter and quieter and just sort of not be a thing any more. And it must've just been outside or something like that. And then we were doing our thing, we were playing ball or something, I don't remember. And then one of the girls in the transition program told me that she thought that my father was having an affair with Charlotte Church because she saw these pictures of them together on the internet. And that all the details about how she was attracted to him because he made her feel so special and how now she wanted to be called Evelyn or Gigi, and that Charlotte was just sort of a middle name. And that was such a surprise! And I think there was one other person involved in this, but I can't remember who. And then all of a sudden I was here in my house and I found this CD on the desk that like had some pictures and stuff on it. So I brought it up here and put it in my machine up here and tried to open it up, and it started acting like the Windows operating system, like the usual thing that you get, and to close in the upper right and all like that. And when I finally got to open the main part, it was like some kind of game thing. It was all these different pictures, and I was trying to copy and paste that one picture of him with Charlotte Church onto like a blank document, and I couldn't because it was in this game thing. And I was trying to open up the list of jpegs to that I could just grab that one, and I woke up before I could get there."

I think it was about somebody saying something about being totally irresponsible. I can't remember what the situation was, but I think it -- oh, I know what it was. Something about putting so much food at the top of the refrigerator and it blocks the light at the bottom on Jack's sandwich and then wouldn't we give him enough consideration to at least let the fridge light be on his sandwich. And that was something that my father was saying. And this dream is full of bits and pieces of nonsense. And I think another thing was -- let's see her now -- oh, there was this picture, there was this still picture of one of these American Idols standing on stage. I think it was like a freeze-the-tape shot, if you know what I mean. Somebody was saying something about that it was going to start up a second time this year, but it was going to be a lot sloppier and a lot goofier. And I'm trying to think, there's something else. Something about a machine that wasn't really adjusted right, and you had to do something really weird in order to adjust it. That's about all."

I dreamt that I was staying at this hotel because I was going to a place where I had to be by myself. But it was kind of a weird hotel in that I think the way it worked was you had to exchange your bags at just a certain time, and it was something scary like you had to do a math problem in order to get them back. And I remember being kind of lost, and it was really, really late. It was like after dark, and I was outside, and I was trying to get back to this hotel. And then once I got into the hotel, I didn't know where my room was. It was just kind of all mixed up jumble of mish-mash, I don't remember. But these scenes were totally incongruent. Next thing I knew I was with this girl, and my father I think, and I had the bird and the bird wasn't just a live bird; he was part live and part mechanical. He had this mechanical thing in him where he would start saying crazy things, and I think there was something about, \"new bells, cockle shells,\" but I don't remember where it came in. I just know that it came in somewhere. I know there was more, and I'm missing half the pieces, but lately I've been really bad about not remembering my dreams that well. Now obviously some of this came from the convention, and yeah, it was a big hotel and yeah, I had to be by myself, but I didn't feel alone at the convention because there were so many other people, period, and people I could feel like were friends, and people that were visually impaired and knowing that they were here for the first time too. And I wanted to learn from them how they were going to function, so I didn't feel alone. But in my dream I felt terribly alone. And the thing about exchanging our bags all over the place, I don't know exactly where that came in, but I do know there was this guy with us that liked \"Mash,\" but I was never scared of losing my bags or scared of something taking them.

I keep having dreams on and off about fire trucks with the scary back-up alarm sound, and it's got to be kind of a dream symbol and I've got to figure out what it means. But anyway, I dreamt that I was going to help out the fire station with some kind of carnival or something. I don't remember having to deal with the Peavey system, but I was running around like putting tables up and stuff, and I had my cell phone on. The thing of it was, whenever anybody would call me on the cell phone, instead of answering the phone, I had to jump on the, you know, like hold onto the side of one of the trucks and let them drive off on a call with me. And we didn't only go on a call, we just sort of went around the block and came back. That was kind of stupid! But I had a partner who was going to drive, like a man, like you know how they do. And my father was there and I had a feeling he was like directing the events. He wasn't really going on any calls, but he was like an active lieutenant for the day. And when we'd jump on the side of the truck, the truck had two vacuum cleaner hose like type things hanging off the back of it dragging in the street. And you know how back-up alarm goes \"Doo doo, doo doo,\" well, the one hose would make the high \"Doo\" sound and the other hose would make the \"doo.\" [lower pitch] And now that I think about it, it's the funniest thing. It would be going down the road like that. And it would do that sound when we were going forward, and we wouldn't back up, we'd just go forward and it would make that sound. And I know there was something more. Oh, in my dream it kind of scared me and I was dreading, dreading, dreading having to go on that. And so whenever I would get a call on my cell phone, I would think, \"Oh no, oh no, I've got to go do this.\" And that was that."

It was a few more octaves than the Music Major, but it was kind of similar. And it came with these little figures of girls with instruments that you had to stand on the, you know, the top ledge above where the keys are. And they were just little things that came with it, and they each had a story. You know, the plastic like the Easter rabbit that comes on top of those candy things? Well, it was kind of like that. There was a tall, slender -- and these were about 4 or 5\" high -- there was a tall, slender Caucasian woman in a pink dress, like a prom dress, with a flute. And then there was a short, kind of fat black girl with a trumpet. And there was sort of a brownish gray in-between person with some kind of harp thing. And there was somebody else with a French horn that was like a little boy. And they had a storybook that went along, and as you read the story, you were supposed to play the part of each character and you were supposed to change the keyboard to their particular instrument sound. And the kids and I were trying to do this. It was kind of funny, but the kids and I were trying to do this, and I don't remember if we ever got through it, but it was something along, \"Here comes Letty; she's ready to see her.\" And then \"doot, do, doot, do, do\" and \"Now, here comes the other one. She's a little more shy, doot, do, doot, do, do,\" or something like that. And I don't remember anything more."

And we were going to take some Pringles and some root beer and some fun snacks. And we were just going to go there and munch out and relax and just have fun. We were supposed to leave the house at 3:00 so that it would give us an hour and a half to be over there before she has to come home and fix supper. Well, she was dawdling -- and diddling and dawdling, and diddling and dawdling, and we weren't even close to getting out of the house until like 4:30. And I said, \"Listen, we took up all our time. What's the use of us going now?\" And all the stuff was out in the front yard by the bike, and the chips and everything was out there, and the boom box had turned into a small, little dinky, teeny portable unit. And I was bringing it inside, and I came in the front door and my father was standing right there on the front porch and said, \"Well, hello, Jess!\" I just sort of put it down in a corner and was really embarrassed.

And I was getting really, really hot and bothered on that bench about something, and I bent over the back of it and I had the notion that somebody saw me. And I'm trying to think what else happened. Oh, then we were inside again, and Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there, and we were giving my father a Father's Day present, but there was a wedding card that I made that was just of a couple, a bride and a groom, but when you opened up the card, it said something really gross inside -- I don't remember what. But Sheryl gave that card to my father and I snatched it away from him because I said, \"That's not a Father's Day card; that's supposed to be for somebody else and that's for something else.\" And then I think I woke up."

And you had to be a licensed driver to be able to take care of these horses. And that was kind of weird, but I felt sort of inferior because I'm not a licensed driver, but what does being a licensed driver have to do with being able to take care of them? And they were, they just seemed like kind of prissy people that didn't belong in the country, if you know what I mean.

And my mother went outside and called the people on the cell phone to tell them that 16th Street was closed, 5th Street was closed, and 2nd Street was closed because they were doing some massive construction. And at the concert they were like, the band was sitting up there with a blue background, and for, I saw for whatever reason, I was doing like some really sick stuff in front of everybody and trying not to make it obvious. But it was such a habit. And I don't remember too much more.

She sort of quacked like a female duck, but she had a long neck and a big body like a goose.

And she kind of got tired and I picked her up and carried her. And she just had a real sorry sound to her, and I had the feeling she hadn't been eating very well. And I told the lady who runs this place, I showed her this black goose and I said, \"I don't think she's been eating that well. Look at her.

I dreamt that I was back at my high school again, except this time I was with Astrid and Darlene, and I was there like a couple hours after school had left out for some odd reason. And I was there with my mobility instructor, Mr. Heffler, and they were doing some construction on the stairs and in order to actually get down the stairs, they had the stairwell part blocked off, and they had some like loose boards. You had to undo one of the loose boards and climb down a little step ladder makeshift thing to actually get down to the lower level. And the elevator was, it kind of worked sometimes and it didn't work other times, and we didn't want to take a risk. And I think me and Darlene were on the elevator one time, and the building had like five or six floors for some odd reason, and for whatever reason the elevator wouldn't stop at whatever floor we wanted. And I think this dream was a big hodgepodge mish-mash of all different stuff, and I think after I got my business done, I was like wandering around in this school building that was my high school, and it was all in shambles, and it was supposedly that way because they were doing construction. And I mentioned about the stairwell being blocked off and there was just stuff laying around all over everywhere. And it was real precarious. And Darlene and I had a cab to catch. I don't know what business we had to do over at the school, but after we finished our business we had a cab to catch at 4:30, I think. And it was real gray and rainy outside and we were making our way back to the cab circle because that's where the cab was going to pick us up. And I don't remember if I ever made it or not. I don't remember too much. This was kind of a dumb dream."

I think my mother and somebody else were still getting ready, and my father was standing at the door like, \"Okay, I'm ready whenever you are.\" And I was sitting on the porch swing, and Sam gets out of the car and comes up to the porch and comes in the door and closes it. And this is just unfolding like ______ just I guess so we can look at it, but I think he's like cocking a gun or something, and then he went back out the door, and he got a chain saw and I saw he was going to bring it in the house. And he's revving it up and stuff out front there, and I thought he was going to bring it into the house. And so I ran through the house, and for some reason our house was a little bigger. And then different things kept stopping us. I think I might have been riding with Elizabeth a little bit, but I can't remember if we actually went where we were going. We were planning a wedding for me. Apparently Grandpa had given me some wedding rings and we had to just find me a person to go through the ceremony with just to show him that I got married with his rings, and we weren't actually going to legally do it, I don't think. And I can't remember who it was going to be, but we were getting all this stuff ready. And people were just like dawdling majorly because there were so many things, and I was outside getting some different stuff. And there was a brown and a white baby chick, and I would catch one of them and take it to the side of the house and put it in a cage, and then I'd go up for the other one. And when I was catching these chickies, I was sort of thinking how I've got to bring them in here so they won't run too far and so the truck won't back over them. And there was also a brown and a white grown chicken that I was catching and putting by the side of the house because I didn't want them in the cage so they would peck the babies. And I was sort of devising some kind of little fence to keep them by the side of the house. And then I was doing a bunch of other stuff in the yard, but I can't remember what. And then I was coming in the house and saying, \"Okay, everybody, are you all ready finally?\" And they were saying, \"Well, we're going to come out there to you.\" And they were saying something like, \"I'd better go talk to Grandpa because I don't know if he wants you to have his rings or if he wants you to have my rings.\" And then I woke up. I know there were more elements to it, but I can't possibly remember them all. I think there was some kind of orange blower thing involved somewhere, but I can't remember what."

One was kind of small and the other three were really big, and somebody was saying I should try them out and see what the sound sounded like, see how real they sounded. And I don't think my mother or my father were there. I think this was like a big, it was either a garage sale or a party; I couldn't figure out which. But they were inside, busy as anything, and there were people everywhere. And so I put the smallest one on a little table out front, and there was a whole bunch of chaos and confusion, so I had to really listen and tell if it sounded normal or not. And it didn't really. It was kind of funny and kind of weird. And then, so I put it back on the sidewalk where it was with the others, and a bunch of other boxes of clothes and toys and things. And I went inside and my mother was making me a birthday cake that was supposed to look like that, either that or a mixer; I couldn't figure out which. But she started frosting it with chocolate frosting, and dabbing some white here and there. And next thing I know, the very front of the cake was crumbling off, and I could see that inside it was a yellow cake. And then some more of the sides crumbled off, and this cake was just getting smaller and smaller and messier and messier. And I don't remember too much about that little scene. But the next little scene was that my mother and my father were out of town and the house was totally empty, and I was having Angeline and one of her friends over. Now Angeline is a Jehovah's Witness that's been coming around and, you know, sort of preaching once a week. And I was going to serve them Cheerios and something else, Cheerios and tea, I think, for lunch. And I had a little gold card from them that said something other than \"Happy Birthday,\" but I sort of knew it was for my birthday. And I didn't want to tell them too much about what I did for my birthday because they don't celebrate birthdays and they would frown upon it. But I served them Cheerios, and they said that, they called them rings of cereal. One of the girls said that she did like rings of cereal, but without any fat or any sugar or anything in them. And I can't remember, but they just sat there kind of prissy, and I think I woke up."

And we were in his like porch veranda thing, and he had this trellis-like type thing that had shelves and plants and stuff. And we were rigging up all these wires to go around it, and I stuck a lavaliere microphone up there and ran the wire around and dropped another _____ down from something. And I think we might have even set up some Christmas lights. And I don't remember who he was or why I was there, or what else I was setting up, and I just had it a minute ago. I shouldn't have gone to the bathroom before I started recording this. But another little scene thing that was before that, that's really clear in my mind, that I dreamt that my father found out what a teetsy (?) thing is, which really that was something unreal from back in the day when I was real little, that was like a guitar-shaped, light-up flashlight thing that would play the end of \"Have You Seen Her\" and stuff. It was sort of a synesthetic (?) response to the sound that I heard. Well, fast forward 'til now. I dreamt that my father thought that it was something that you would have to connect to the phone line in order to use, and that it would make your phone bill go real high if you did anything on it. And some boy had it, I think. And I was pretty upset and a little afraid because I was under the impression that it wasn't real, and here he's talking like it was real. And I tried to tell him it isn't real, but he said, \"Well, I saw somebody that had one, so it is real.\" And I was terrified. And then I, in my dream I went downstairs after being, I don't know, up here, and my mother and my father were watching TV and I kissed my mother good night and I whispered in her ear that she should come up when she can.

But they were sitting on the porch swing with me, and my mother came home from a shopping trip and she was unloading groceries in the kitchen. And she was complaining about how the store wouldn't cash her out and she had to wait and wait because if the power goes out at the store, then they can't use their register. What else? I think somehow we got over to the girl's house and Astrid and the girl were going to build something. They had like shop tools out and like saws and sanders and vacuum cleaners. And I think in my dream Astrid had a little bit of vision, about like mine, and the girl had a little bit more than I do.

I dreamt that our house was just a little bigger than it is, and our living room was huge and kind of intersected with our porch in a way. There wasn't that wall there. And my mother was sleeping out in the living room with some big pillows and my father was like, \"Are you sleeping out here because the roof's leaking in the bedroom?\" And my mother was like, \"No, I'm just sleeping out here because there's such a nice breeze, so I really appreciate it.\" And then we found out that the roof was leaking in the bedroom and he got so mad that she wouldn't tell him. But instead of roof in my dream, they were talking about the fact that the door was leaking. I don't know why. And let's see; what else? Then after that I was walking around the house getting some stuff out of the kitchen and stuff, and this naked man with a guide dog was going through the house. And I had never seen him before. And I got the impression like he was staying with us or something. And his dog was black, and his shoulders came up to my chest, like a little bigger than they usually are, and was like sniffing me. And the guy was saying, \"Come on. Come on.\" And he just kept walking through our house for some reason. And I was supposed to go down in the cellar to get our party mix that I was going to take to the party today, but they only had this little tiny, little bitty light bulb up in the ceiling of the cellar and it wasn't making much light at all and it was real dark outside. And I told my mother, \"I'm not going to go down there unless you change the bulb and make it its full brightness.\" And I don't think I ever did get down there to get my cereal, I don't know, but I was real glad that all of this was a dream."

I think I felt like I had a fever or something and I just wanted to lay around and do nothing. And I don't remember too much more about that. But then in the next little vignette I felt okay and we were out at the beach, and I was walking in this water and my father said there were a ton of little sharks around. But I wasn't really afraid of them because I knew they were just going to swim around and not bite us. They were like the size of kids' toys. But then when I was sitting on the beach when he was out swimming, there was a stingray laying up on the shore, and the stingray stung me right in the palm of my hand, and it wasn't really all that painful, surprisingly enough, but the stingray wasn't soft like they usually are; it was hard and rubbery like a toy. And I knew there were more in the sand because I could kind of feel them, and this was gross, but there was one -- I guess I was swimming naked -- there was one that was about to sting me in the butt, and I like shuffled it away. And then I was like, \"Well, what am I supposed to do? I got stung by a stingray.\" And he said, \"Now let's dive in the water.\" And I was afraid to go across that sand that led, you know, like there's loose sand then there's packed sand and then there's water? In the packed sand stingrays were popping up all over everywhere. But when I did get in the water, we swam and we swam out to this bridge that was in the middle of the ocean, and I hung onto the side of the bridge because I couldn't touch. And my father pulled a knife out of the bottom of the ocean and said that it was an artifact because it was used during the Civil Rights Movement back in the '60s to cut niggers' heads off. And my father actually said that, and he'd never said anything like that in real life. Now I couldn't understand where in the world that came from. And so I was there on the bridge and he went out for another swim, and he buried the knife back in the sand. And there was this woman that came out on the bridge and gave me a little brochure about herself, like she was some kind of a sea marine biologist or something. And then I woke up."

And all the cars were moved out and kind of parked on the street. And they had tables set up and we were eating lasagna out there. And there was stuff out like she was having some kind of a garage sale, but we were eating and socializing like we were having a party. And then she said that she wanted my mother and I to come with her down to her cellar to help her clean stuff out because she had a bunch of stuff down there that she wanted to have either moved or gotten rid of, I can't remember what. So my mother and I came in the house and went down with her, and then she went back out to the party and my mother went back out and left me down there by myself, which I wasn't scared or anything because her cellar is more like a room to me now than a cellar. And I thought I would never do this, but we slept in her cellar and I went down there a couple times without turning any lights on and it was okay because I just thought of it as a room in her house and I was going into a room where I could sleep. And I'm okay in open dark rooms, you know. And so, but anyway, in my dream there were lights on and stuff and it was okay, but there was concrete on the floor like a cellar. And I was going through clothes and baby toys and junk and stuff, and trying to put things in piles. And then I had a feeling like there was some, I didn't know why, but I had to get behind this rack of clothes and in behind this curtain. And I was fighting and fussing and fighting my way back there, and I finally got back there and there was like a little alcove with like a little stage and a big, huge keyboard back there. And I was thinking about how everybody was outside, and my mother was outside doing something with everybody. And so I was looking at it and studying it, and I was studying the control panel up at the top, and I saw that where there was like a power switch and display with m______ meters and a bunch of other stuff I didn't understand. And there was a volume knob at the far left, and I put it down like about it, and it felt big and kind of bulky like the ones on the stove are. And so I put it kind of down real low and then I turned the thing on, and this voice said, \"Please do not change any settings.\" And it started playing like a demo song, but sounded like some kind of Rod Stewart theme or something like that. And I had the volume down as far as it would go and it was still like filling the room with sound, but I wasn't getting uncomfortable or anything; I was more like, \"Oh gosh, what did I do?\"  And then, before I knew it, I was kind of somewhere else doing something, and it was like there was a big -- what should I call it? -- it filled the cellar with sound and it was reverberating and everything. And next thing I knew, Bobby was down there with it and he moved it out of that place behind the curtain and put it out in the front of the room in the cellar, and he changed it to like a organ patch (?) and was playing a minor Halloween theme and doing scary laughs and jokes and stuff, as though we had an audience.

I was over by the chicken cage sitting in the dirt where the truck usually parks, and I was holding this chicken that was a darker brown than a Rhode Island Red, like almost black.

And then we kept going and we got to like an outside part of the park where we were going to just stop for a while and collect our sits, because we started out at 6:00 or so and it was late at night now. I can't remember if it was early in the morning or late at night, but we stopped there to kind of collect our wits. And we were all kind of assembling together and I, my mother gave me my mini disc recorder out of her bag, and she wanted me to put it on my person so that I would have it if I needed it. But I reminded her that to go into the park, we'd have to go through a metal detector and they might find it and they might think it was really weird. And she said, \"You're going to have to get used to this, blah, blah, blah,\" so I put it in my pocket and it had this long RCA to 1/8\" (?) adaptor on it and I kept trying to shove that in my pocket too, and it kept hanging out, which I don't know why I would need that if I'm not connecting it to my sound system here at home.

And they would argue and debate over things, and one of the claims that one of them made was that you're never supposed to eat sheep meat, no matter what, that sheep are like the holiest symbol and you're never supposed to eat them. And it really isn't right to keep them in captivity, but a lot of people do. And I dreamt that there was this one lady that they talked about who would, you really weren't supposed to eat cat meat either, but she would like cut into the leg of her cat and take a little bit of meat off of him, and sew up the cut. Talk about gross! And the animal would live and she wouldn't want the neighbors to know that she was eating the meat of her cat, but she was, and the animal was still alive so it wasn't really obvious. And after all of that, I faded into another little scene that we were at a dock, at a boating ramp dock thing, and my father was getting training through the Fire Department, along with some other guys, in how to drive these dinky little boats that would go fast one way and then would go really fast the other way in reverse. And I guess they were supposed to be used to look for people and stuff, but this boat was small enough that an adult person could lay down in the bottom of it and they would be touching either end of it with their head and their feet, almost a little bigger than a bathtub. So my mother and my father were lounging back in the seat of this thing and they were going to start up the motor and start running around, and they got me in between them on board and it was sort of floating away from the dock, and they were going to start up the motor and start running it around and stuff. And I asked, \"Well, was it going to be as loud as the one we used to have?\" And they were like, \"Yeah.\" So I sort of jumped out of the boat, which was really easy. All I had to do was just swing my legs over and I was in the water. And I swam back to the dock and I just laid on the dock and just let them drift away. And then I woke up."

And then there was another building, a few feet away from the first building, which had more bleachers on the roof so people could sit up there and still see what was on the stage. And I can't remember who was going to be in concert, but I think it was going to be somebody good. And I think we were milling around and stuff before the show and we were going to get something to eat. And we went into this building underneath the first set of bleachers, and we were looking around and talking to some people, and we were in a buffet thing. And it was like a buffet, but everything was labeled with a price. For example, one little quiche, which was the size of a quarter, was $3.00, and three stuffed mushrooms were $20.00. Even though it was so just like so expensive, we were like just sort of throwing things on our plate and we were going to like run out. And after we were done, after my mother was done filling up a plate for us, she'd like say, \"Come on, Jess, come this way,\" and she like disappeared. And I looked out in the hallway and all around the courtyard place, and I couldn't find her. And I didn't want to go up on the bleachers yet because you needed a ticket to get up there and she had our tickets. And I just sort of lost her. And I was wearing, at this time I was conscious that I was wearing a skirt and I was wearing stockings, and let me think how this went. I think I remember having something stashed in my underwear, but I don't remember what, and my stockings were falling down. And this man stops me in the middle of the courtyard and pulls up my skirt and says, \"Here, let me help you pull up your stockings.\" And he started jibbling and jibbling and trying to pull up my stockings for me, and I said, \"No thank you. I can do it myself.\" But he keeps trying to pull up my stockings. And then he stands there in the middle of the courtyard and puts his arms around me and starts talking, and thinks he can help me find my mother. But I really didn't believe him. And I don't remember how, but my mother and I eventually met up and she said that she had a ticket for right in front of the stage, in the front area, like in the drawing in an amphitheater it had the long dance floor in front; and a ticket for the highest row in the first set of bleachers. And she wanted us to experience each one and switch places in the middle of the show so we could compare the view from each seat thing. And she said that we should each have a cell phone so that we could call each other, but if there's a wild concert going on, I don't know how in heck we're going to hear each other.

And Sam was sitting in my chair, and he pulled out my tray and he started like messing around and playing a riff (?) and stuff. And my mother was like getting all upset. And my mother was saying, \"Don't touch everything, Sam, you quit it.\" And I'm like, \"He can touch it if he wants to.\" And then after he did that, he like cleared out all the junk that was in there and dumped it all in my mother's room and put the case up there, back there where it was supposed to go, along with a little baby chair in there. And while all that was going on, I was trying to pack up like extra cables and like stands and stuff I take when I go on DJ gigs. And then I was going the day before over to Bob Alligood's house, Bob and Janet Alligood were friends of Elizabeth's. And let's see, I'm wasting tape here. I was setting up the Peavey system and testing it and stuff the day before the wedding was actually supposed to happen because I wanted to see how the acoustics of the room where and how the layout was going to be and how I was going to run my wires because they wanted my table right in the middle of the room and I would just have wires going all over everywhere if I wasn't careful. And they had this like, this thing that kept evolving, and they kept telling me different information that was evolving. And at first I was packing up the Peavey system to take it home because the wedding wasn't for another day yet, but then and so I had it like underneath a little cover way overhang thing, and it was raining and pouring like crazy outside. And I was calling my father on the cell phone and I was telling him that the wedding wasn't going to be tomorrow; it was going to be 5:00 today. And so I just needed to just sort of hang out here until then. And then they came out and they told me, \"Whoops! We need you to be here at 1:30, so just hang right where you are because we're going to do the ceremony here at 1:30, and then we're going to go at 6:00 over to the banquet hall, like called Banquet Masters, for the reception. And then they changed it yet again on me and they said, \"You need to be at the banquet hall at 1:30 for the ceremony, and you need to be back here at 6:00 for the reception.\" And I'm getting all turned around, and I'm thinking, \"How in the heck am I going to get the Peavey system over to the banquet hall and set up before 1:30, and get it in there without people fussing too much?\" And then I woke up. I think that had something to do with the political convention that I saw on TV last night. I saw Theresa Hinds Carey speak in that bright red dress, and in my dream Deanna Alligood was wearing the same kind of dress. I don't think there's anything else to it except I'm just thinking about how I'm going to function in this... [end]."

            "content": "Last night I had a terrible dream that I wasn't even going to put on this tape because I'm so ashamed, and I say to myself, \"Well, how could you dream such a thing?\" But then again, I read in one of the dream books, written by a dream counselor, that somebody was having dreams nightly that were worse than what I've had. And she said that you really can't be responsible for what you dream. And I have a feeling that if I don't want my conscious mind to scream out things that are unfit for it, I guess, I think I should I put it on my tape, just because. I dreamt that my father had lots of melanoma showing up in his system again, and he wasn't going to have any kind of treatment or anything done. In my dream Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there and a couple other people, maybe their significant others. And we were at Grammy's house, and except the stairwell wasn't the narrow thing that ours is; it was like, pstttt, I'm getting all screwed up. The stairwell wasn't a narrow thing like it is; it was wide like ours is. And I dreamt that my father was just going to go and lay out in the back yard and not let anybody do anything for him or anything. And Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and my mother and I were sitting upstairs in the upstairs room in Grammy's house and Sheryl and Sandra kept asking, \"Why does he keep laying there? Why does he keep laying there?\" And my mother sat us all down and told us all why. And somebody said that he was laying there totally still, and that he looked like he was done. And then we were all emotional and crying and stuff, and saying all that we could have done. And then he stands up and comes in the house, and he has nothing but anger for all of us for even thinking of him in that way, even thinking that we could have done anything, even shedding a tear and having no comp______ of how it was. And then it was like we thought that he wasn't here any more and then he suddenly comes back to life. And then he went back outside and he sort of knelt down and laid down in the grass, and we had a feeling that was it then. And we were sad for a little bit, but we went on. We were all there together kind of doing things around to fix up the house and everything. And it's kind of funny because this house was like a combination of Grammy's house and our house, and the upstairs was like her house, but the downstairs was like our house, and it had our back yard and our stairwell. And the worst thing about this all is we were getting ready to have a party even, to celebrate me going off to my tech school, and we were going to invite all kinds of people. And we were supposed to make a party the day after all this was happening. And I had a feeling like I wanted us to celebrate something else besides me going off to school. And then I woke up about 2:00 o'clock in the morning, and I lifted my head, and I said, \"Thank goodness that is only a dream.\" But it really didn't feel like a dream while it was going on; it felt so real. And there's not a lot of dreams that are like that. Most of them are too crazy to really feel real."

The story was something along the line that there were these two brothers and I think they were friends, and they were like criminals. And they were taking a road trip up to this museum, and I don't think that they were going to steal anything, but they were going to confront somebody. I don't remember anything really about how the story went, but my ending that I was going to add was something like there was a third person that comes out of the woodwork that is the first person's brother and he doesn't know it. And those two were going to conspire to get the person and everything they had, and this guy was going to put butter all over his steering wheel and all over the handle of his gun so that anybody that, any cops that tried to take his car or anything wouldn't be able to keep a hold of the steering wheel.

And I was thinking how I understand the relationship between power current and resistance, but I don't exactly know what aspect of it we actually pay for and is measured monthly. Well, in my dream my father told me that we pay for how much current we use, but I know that reason tells me it's how much power we use, which is a combination of voltage and current. It took me a while before I got that! And he was having me check that little rheostat for the lights up there with a continuity checker that was all metal, and just had little things at the end. And I put it on each little screw of the rheostat and the light lit up full, and I took the thing off and it stayed full for about a minute or two and then it went dim again. That is woo-woo, man!"

It started out that I had done something with the Peavey system in our back yard. Apparently we had been like having a party or something, like a neighborhood association, and I was starting to pack up the Peavey system and I went to put a cushion or something in the garage, and I got some seed and I noticed that in addition to our chicken, we now had like three or four ducks and two geese. And the ducks and geese were white and it was hard to tell them apart, and there were also one or two Muskogee ducks. And I was thinking, \"How cool is that!\" And I got the notion that somebody was moving out. Nobody told me, but I remembered my mother telling me in my dream that somebody had been moving out and gave us their ducks and geese to take care of. And they were really tame, and they were coming up to me and eating. And then I started packing up the Peavey system, and I realized that my power cord had been just severed, just like that, for some reason, and then I was on the front porch and I was calling the Peavey place to see if I could get an extra one. And my mother read me a serial number off of it that I copied down. And the person on the phone was asking me like, \"Well, did you step on it? Did something happen? What happened here?\" And all I could them was there was a bunch of commotion going on at this party and that's all I knew. And so then I went back out in the back yard and I realized that the severed cord wasn't the Peavey power cord, it was one of those extension cords. So then I continued packing up and I noticed that there was a keyboard on a stand next to my Peavey board table, and I had the notion that it was from the people that were moving out and they just kind of left it there. I kind of thought it was that, but I also kind of thought that maybe I had a musician at the party and they left it there. But anyway, I picked it up off the stand and wanted to carry it in the house and it was really heavy and I could barely its weight and mass. And I tried to open the door and I couldn't open the door, and I almost opened the thing. And I put it down and I opened the door, and I picked it up again. And I walked through the house, upstairs, and I slid it under my bed. And I don't remember going back to pack up the rest of the Peavey system, but I heard that later my mother and my father were going to be going off somewhere for a little while, and I said, \"Yahoo!\" And I took it out again, and I set it on top, and then I realized that somebody had taken like really fancy beads and costume jewelry, like a really long necklace, and strung it like across the front of it. The necklace was just long enough to fit the width of the unit. And there was this _____ set of beads and charms and old b______ and stuff flopping around on its right side, hanging from the chain _______.  ___________________________. But then I realized that I felt guilty because I thought that the unit might be Oxama's, but then I kept having to remember that it was from those people who were moving out. It felt so weird to me. I said, \"Okay, this is probably not a dream,\" and then I woke up and I was like, \"Yes, it is.\"  That was that."

And we were playing this game with like a bunch of letters and little design things that you were supposed to pull out of a box and make words. And whatever the words said you had to do.

So before I wrote anything more in this diary book, there was a tape that came with the red book of prayers and stuff, and the tape had a choir singing and then a background accompaniment and a girl speaking.

It was kind of a blah band, but for some reason we liked them. And it was being held at the nearby city's Pier because it was a benefit for some kind of senior thing, and it was like an outside thing where you see out in a little café and you listen to them. Well, I was wondering, well, why can't they be at our pier sometime, at my home town's pier, and at the nearby city's pier other times. And let's see, I don't remember exactly what, but my mother had me take a cab home from downtown my home town, and when I got, _____ and the lady was real friendly that drove me. But when I got home, she said it was like $50, and I only had like a ten and a couple ones, so I ran inside and I got some more. And I gave it to her and I was just so distraught, I couldn't believe I took a $50 cab ride, which, you know, from downtown back to here would probably only be $10 or $15 on an average. And then we were back to the nearby city's Pier, getting ready to hear this band, and it started to rain and lightning and thunder, so we went inside this library and we sat around a while. And that's about it."

And I had a music class with a woman that I went to, and she was having us go around the room and sight read out loud, you know, like you read out of any other book. And this room was like big and open and it had tables with all kinds of stuff that we sat at. And the floor was yellow, kind of like linoleum and let's see, she was having us paint these little rolls for some reason. I can't tell you what that had to do with it, other than it was a sort of melding into being an art class. And when that class was over, my mother had my schedule and she was waiting outside for me. And I didn't know what else I had to do in the day and I was kind of nervous because I knew I was just going to miss a class because that music class went over so long. And, let's see, oh, she read my schedule out loud to me, and I had that class first and then three personal fitness classes, and then something else. And I asked if she would take me around and show me where they all were, and she's like, \"Well, I really don't have time; can we do it another day?\" And I said, \"Well, the least you could do is mark that paper for me.\" And she's like, \"Well, there's not a copy machine here, so let's go home and maybe we'll get over to the hardware store sometime.

And she said she was going to give them a natural toy, whatever that means. And at the same time, I was messing with something else trying to get it to work. And then I kind of shifted scenes to the fact that we were in a hospital, and my mother was having some kind of heart attack or something like that, and she was like having trouble breathing. And I can't remember exactly how it all unfolded, but there were some kind of doctors there and everything, but in a matter of a little while they said that she was alright and they wheeled out, and I think Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there. And we were all sitting in chairs that were rolling, and we were wheeling her down the aisle and out the door. And somebody said, \"We've had enough nervousness; let's go to a place where we can relax.\" So we were at this place that I thought could be Tyme Gardens; it was a big open-like type space. And there were various sidewalks that kind of intersected at places, and they ran into these buildings that I could see off in a distance that I thought had things in them. And I thought that there was more park beyond the buildings. And I was rolling in my chair still, and I rolled it backwards up the hill and then I let it roll all the way down the hill. And then I rolled it over to a little bathroom station like thing, and I was wondering, \"Now where in the world did my mother and my father go?\" And they were with two other people, I can't figure out who, and I was just thinking how I was either going to have to go to a pay phone and call my father's cell phone and say, \"Where the heck are you?\" or I was just going to go enjoy the park myself. But I was thinking how I wasn't going to be able to find anything in the park, and how I didn't know how to get exactly past those buildings to more of the inner, inside part of the park. You know how theme parks have a big area where you just sit and wait as an entrance, and there's the actual thing inside. Well, that's kind of how this was. And that's really all there was to it."

And I was laying near her, and we were in the cab. And then I told her, \"Now watch for the exit, because it can really go quick when we come to the exit.\" Well, she wasn't ready at the time and the exit came up, but the truck sort of went down the exit by itself, and she was just all nervous and jumpy because she didn't think the truck had any brakes. But it did. And we went to the parking lot at the store that I was pretty sure she had to stop at. I don't remember too much more about that. But then, all of a sudden, we were in this house that was like an artsy show house, but I had the notion that they were wanting to sell it, but they were holding a benefit dinner there for some kind of charity. And Sheryl and Sam were there, and they were having this dance thing, like meters and strobe lights on the porch, and I couldn't really go there yet because we were waiting in line for the dinner thing. And then it kind of quieted down and the porch was empty and it was daytime, and I was in line and I had my plate finally and I was going to a place at the table to sit down. And one of the ladies asked me a question right when I was taking a bite, and they said, \"Jasmine, spit out your food and look at me before you talk.\" One of the old crazy ladies that was giving the thing. She expected me to spit out my food instead of talk with a mouthful. And the thing of it was, somehow I got in the line at this food place ahead of my mother, but I wanted to sit next to her because I got this huge plate and I wanted her to share it with me. I think we could only pay for one plate and we were going to share it. And so I think the lady even said something like, \"You need to sit next to your father because he came to dinner with you.\" But my father wasn't there; it was just my mother and me. And then the lady decided she's going to get me out of the prissy dinner scene by taking me to see another little like mother-in-law house attached to this place. And she kept _________ this next, oh what should I say, across a little boardwalk and into this little house. And I noticed a porcelain teapot that wasn't fired yet that had all kinds of little beadwork on it, and I like pressed it against my face and smelled it. And when I took it away, my mouth had the beads on it, and I had to hurry up and try to scrape the beads off it so the lady wouldn't see. And then I woke up."

And I should have recorded it this morning when I first woke up, but I was so sleeping, I could not articulate it in the way that I remembered it really that well. So I just tried to so-to-speak make a copy of it to my conscious mind as much as I could and just sort of save it there until I could record it with better description now. Now I really can't remember which of these scenes came first, but I'll try to just cover them all somehow. I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and Sam were in town, again, and I was at this school campus with them that was sort of an unconventional large, sprawling campus. I couldn't figure out if it was my tech school or my college or my high school, but I think it had elements of a little bit of each, and it was just sort of a school that represented a little bit of each one. And to start off with, I was at this show with them, there was this big tent that was like, that was their cafeteria, and they had long wooden tables and we were going to eat something and watch this show. And they had huge light-up, blow-up things like you see at Halloween and Christmas now of Sesame Street characters and other little animals and things that would sort of float up to the top of the tent, and they would talk and sing and there would be three of them up there dancing around at a time. And they had these high, squeaky, kind of cartoony voices. And I can't remember what the significance of that was, but I think it was starting to rain and the show kind of ended, and I was walking around this campus with like Sam was there. And it was starting to thunder, and I was thinking how I should get into the main building at my high school so that I would be out of the rain and thunder, but having a concern that the thunder might set off the fire alarm and it might be a real problem because here in a building and it's pouring down rain, and that happens, you can't run outside obviously and you're just sort of stuck there. But I wasn't too afraid of that, and once that part kind of subsided, Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were going to hang out in the big tent some more and I sort of had the notion that there was going to be another show, but it was going to be sort of on the scary side. And so I walked up some outside stairs of a building that had a lake in front of it, and I had keys and I had the notion that I was going into my apartment. And I was standing on the balcony kind of waving bye to them, and then I went in my door. And then -- this is the craziest part of all, and I think this is the last part -- you know that Santa mechanical that we have for Christmas? Well, I think his right hand is in a fist and he has a candle in his left hand and opening he has a baby. Well, in my dream both of his hands were in fists and his left hand had a light and his right had just had a gap for something to go in. And I think my preschool teacher, appeared in all of this somewhere, and she gave me this candy cane, this fake candy cane with a fake Styrofoam present and some holly tied to it to put in the hand of my Santa figure. But she warned me that it came with a scary song that had a lot of \"oo\" words in it, and that I shouldn't open it and use it, that I should give it to somebody who didn't have that problem.  And how that goes together, I can't even begin to tell you. But I can't remember. I think I gave it to Sam and he told me he wasn't going to open it in front of me, but then I got curious and I opened it, and I put the candy cane in his hand and what it is, is when you put it in his hand and turn the figure on, it makes it play that song instead of a Christmas song. And I think it went something like, \"_______________\" [singing] Now that's a song I would hear the kindergarteners do when I was doing Braille with Ms. Fletcher back in 4th grade. We were in that little room by the kindergarten pod, and I don't know what made me bring it up now. And I remember thinking about that and not really being scared, but sort of being puzzled as I sort of faded into consciousness. And that was that."

I dreamt that Terri was trying to organize -- actually it was a person that was a cross between Terri and Mrs. Dougherty; I couldn't figure out who it was though. But she was trying to organize this musical play where people dance and sing, and the story line was supposed to be about a person who got sick and had to go to the hospital and recovered. And we were doing these things where we were building these fake beds and putting Styrofoam in them, and I was showing this lady how I could dance and spin on one foot and I could sing real elegantly so that I could be one of the characters. And I was showing her how I balance on one foot and spin and stuff. And there were three or four boys and another girl. I had a feeling that Theresa and Joey were involved in this somehow. And there was one boy that she was calling Stan, and I think I should say that the significance of Stan's name is that in Sound and Vision there's a man named Stan who was putting, installing a whole house audio system in a rural country back in the boonies somewhere, but I don't know what that means to the dream story. But anyway, I was going to be like the sound designer or something for this play show thing, and we needed to go to the fire station and record some fire engine things so that we could do the amb_______ shuffle thing. And we were at this fire station, and for some reason there weren't a lot of fire people around. But the fire station had a bedroom that looked just like my mother and my father's bedroom, and I was in that bedroom with my mini disc recorder, and in this dream I could actually see the videos very well. There was LED instead of that LCD black on gray. Let's see, and out on the driveway in the garage area there was a truck there, and two of the fire guys were out there watching, and this Stan was going to start up the truck and maneuver it around and run the things. And I ran a long wire with the lavaliere microphone on it from my mini disc recorder in this bedroom out to a post by the truck, and I stuck it on a post, a little clip on the post. And I went back in the bedroom and I covered my ears with like cotton and stuff, because I was really scared of the sound he was going to make, but I could watch my reviews (?) and see that it was coming out. And so I was there, and let's see, I was watching the meters and I didn't see anything, and I didn't hear anything, but then about ten minutes later this boy named Stan came in and he said, \"Did you get it?\" He told me, \"I backed the truck up and I went in a 360 degree circle and I ran the back-up alarm. Did you get it?\" And I said, \"No, I didn't get it. I didn't see anything in the meters.\" And he said, \"I even ran the siren; did you get that?\" And I said, \"No, I didn't get that either.\" And then I woke up. That was bizarre, man! How bizarre! How bizarre! I don't understand how this Stan played into this thing, but I think this can have some kind of meaning to it. I'm not sure what though. ___________ bring out a couple of inhibitions that I might be having about once I get into the field, I might be having to record things and deal with things that might scare me a little bit and might dig up things, because stuff like that is rare, but it does surface and when it surfaces, you just have to deal with it. You've gotta just sort of, you know, you got to deal with it. And I think the part where he drove the truck backwards in a circle a few times so that he could run the back-up alarm, that comes from a little toy truck that Brittany had that would go in a circle and do that, and that was a very infamous thing back about, gee, I can't even remember when. And I think the part about the dancing and singing play comes from me thinking a lot about the Celine Dion show in Las Vegas, and how I would love to read a book about everything that went into that show and everything that they did, and how they decided to do just what they did."

The main point of it was that Suzy Barton was going to perform at Disneyland, and she had three free tickets, and she was going to give one to her brother, one to my mother and one to me, if we could go. And it was like I knew that it was Thursday night, and according to my dream, we would be off down the Interstate by this morning. And ironically I saw in The Weekender that Celine Dion was going to be there at the park the same night. In fact, Suzy was going to open for her. And there was all kind of hoopla about there was this lady that was putting a house together that would fit the pampered diva and all that stuff, and then I realized that I really should call Suzy Barton just to make sure the tickets really were free and we didn't have to pay anything because she heard something about, \"Well, if you guys can come up with $45, then you can go,\" or something like that. And so I was trying, it was like real late at night, and I called and I left her a message. And then I was kind of fading into consciousness and realizing that it was a dream. And last night I never did, I mean, the night before I never did get around to recording that one. I dreamt that, first, I was in the kitchen with Sheryl, Sandra and Sam and a couple people from my chorus class, and we were all in these black robes and we were going to sing a song in the kitchen. And this teacher lady had a keyboard set up on the counter, and it was plugged into that outlet by the toaster, and she was going to accompany us. And next thing I knew, I was in this music class with this teacher, and the chorus was all singing, and for whatever reason, I had to work on this typing practice program. You know how they give you these typing exercise drill things? Well, I was working on a program like that on a computer that was set up on a rolling cart in the middle of the floor. This room was just huge. And apparently I was doing pretty good with the typing program because the teacher came over and said, \"Okay, I think you're ready for something else now.\" And my mother was there, and did something else, I don't remember what. But the teacher was going to sort of put her class on hold and go and try to find a midi (?) program and see if she could make it work. And while she was gone, I noticed that in this sort of trashy box there were several unopened tapes and CD's. There were cards with song words on them, and there were ten tubes of wrapping paper that were just going to be thrown in the garbage. So I was like trying to pile that stuff in my book bag without the other kids seeing, and trying to save it from the garbage, because it was really good stuff. And then I woke up."

But the craziest main thing that I remember was that I had the notion that before I had the ability to scan pictures, I could actually take the vacuum cleaner and not actually vacuum the picture up into the vacuum cleaner, but I could let it just kind of get like sucked up towards the brush and make a really, really funny sound and just hover there for a little bit.  And I had the notion that somehow I connected the vacuum cleaner to the computer with a USB cable, but somehow the picture would get over there. Oh, my gosh, how crazy. But then the bad part of the dream was that Sandra was in town with her baby -- that wasn't the bad part. And I was going up to our little attic, which is like a third level of our house, to pack some stuff for me to go. And I was packing up the crazy vacuum cleaner and a couple other things, and I laid down on my back and I fell asleep with the light on and the ladder down. Well, in my dream, either Christian -- which is Sandra's stepdad -- or me shut the light off and closed the ladder thing and was going to try to kill me by leaving me up there. And so in my dream I wake up and I'm in this thing and the ladder is up and the light is off, and I'm like terrified, with a capital T. And I'm yelling and yelling, and finally Sandra comes and then opens the ladder and lets me get down, and I was kind of singing as she was getting me down the ladder, you know, the song from B_____, \"Come and rescue me,\" and I think she carried me as though I was still light enough to be carried. And that's really all I can remember. But I don't know why, I mean, I guess we should say that in that little attic is the only place that I'm really afraid of heights. And I've never really been afraid of heights as a rule, but when I go up that ladder and I'm moving around in there, I just go so slowly and so carefully, even though there's a lot of room because I just don't like looking down that ladder for some reason. And I don't think anybody would suffocate in there because there's plenty of insulation, so I don't know what that was about."

And Aunt Christine had this -- I felt like Aunt Christine was going to come through this beauty line, and she never did. And the next thing was that we were here in my bedroom and it was daylight, my mother pulls out a little portable radio from when the girls were here. It was like theirs. And she turns it on and it's like, she's just talking to it, \"I miss my relative's home town,\" and stuff like that.  That was weird. But then we were like walking, and we said, \"Let's walk to Jackson,\" and I'm like, \"Okay,\" and so we're 15 minutes around and we cross a little bridge diagonal like across some kind of water and we're in this nature park and area that she tells me is Bestin (?). And there's this man with his bird that got loose and almost runs in front of a car, but I was saying to her, \"If it only takes us 15 minutes to walk to Bestin, then why does it take us 3 hours or nearly 8 hours to drive there?\" That was messed up, man!"

And there was a couch right in front of it, so it was like a window instead of a front door. And then the bedroom had somebody else's stuffed animals in it, and it had kind of a small and bleah bed, and there was like a shelf mini sound system up on top, like in order to touch it, you had to stand on tippy toes on the bed, but you had a remote control that you could sit somewhere and control it with. And it sounded kind of old and kind of bleah, and you would press a certain button the remote control and it would act as a remote controller for the washing machine. And it had a little laundry chute where you would put the clothes, that was white, right next to the black sound array setup. And you'd put the clothes in and then you would use the sound system remote to control what the clothes have to do in the washing machine. How bizarre! How bizarre! And then my mother wanted to take me down to the cellar to see what the washing machine was doing, and I just did not want to go. I was scared to death to go in the cellar, and that's really all I can remember about that dream. And then I woke up because I thought somebody was knocking on my door, but it was the stupid window banging on the awning. The wind was blowing it around. I dreamt that we were at the park and my mother was playing one of my mixed CD's on her boom box, which it really doesn't sound that good, but it did in my dream, and I was sitting in a banyan tree. And then I came down and we were laying on a blanket and somehow my father found one of my diary books and happened to open it up to kind of an innocuous passage about being in the park and climbing the tree, and he read it out loud, which I let because I knew there was nothing in that passage. And then he turned the page and he came to something about how hard to get along Arlene is and I made him close the book. And he was suggesting in my dream that he wanted me to scan these pages so that they wouldn't be on paper any more. \"I don't understand,\" he says, \"a person who doesn't think too much technology in somebody's life, gidgets and gadgets, is a good thing.\" But he's got this thing against having stuff on paper.  I don't know what it is, but in my dream he was wanting me to scan those pages in my diary so they wouldn't be on paper any more. And I told him, \"It doesn't do OCR for handwriting. It probably will someday, there'll probably be an update and then I will, but not now. It doesn't do OCR for handwriting.\" Well, he didn't care; he wanted me to. So before I woke up, in my dream I was sitting there trying to do the thing, and I was getting a little tangled up and I wasn't sure where I was going and what I was doing. And then I woke up."

I dreamt that I was already at Full Said for orientation, and we were in this room that had yellow floors in a lightly lit area and blue floors in a darker area. And in the yellow floor area there were some desks and chairs and line up things like bowling alleys, and over the blue floor area there were various -- actually there was only one in this area -- a little work station area with a mixing board and a bench to sit at in front of it and a bench to sit at a few feet back. And it wasn't really a graded test, but the instructor was going to give us a test that we had to go up to the board, figure it out, connect the wires where they needed to go, make all the mix and let him listen to it and just to see kind of, get to know the equipment kind of like. And R_____ and I were going to be a team. And in my dream she was sort of semi-hefty and wearing blue. And in my dream she said that, \"Always Be My Baby\" was her favorite song. And I can't remember what we were going to play through the board, but I ran my hands all over the board, and I wasn't shy about it, and I remember bringing the masters down before I went to feel the connections in back. And there was this digital bit of cable laying next to it that I had the notion was supposed to be used for a microphone input, and it was supposed to work like an XLR, but it wasn't. We had to jam it into one of the places where an XLR went. That was crazy. And so I connected it to the board and to the microphone, and it was making this really awful sound. And I realized that the instructor had tied a knot in it just so we would have to discover it and untie the knot. And then it was better. And then after that, I was on the porch swing telling my mother about it, and in my dream I was feeling really confident and ready for anything basically."

I dreamt that I was at this class with Laurie Madden in college, and it was more of a linguistics class than a Spanish class because we were given these sheets with pictures and mine was super big and dark. And they had pictures and they had sentences that, oh my gosh, were comprised of Spanish words and Italian words and German words and French words all mixed around. There was even some Latin thrown in. And we had to discern the meaning of the sentence based on the familiarity with the Latin bases in each language and look at the picture. Oh yeah, and there were some blanks in the sentence too. And we had to fill in the blanks with Spanish words because that was the only foreign language that we had expressive and receptive skills in. And then we had to write our own sentences, and I don't remember being able to discern too well what the pre-made sentences were. But then I wrote, we wrote some of our own sentences, and one of the sentences was, \"Dwight and his girlfriend had keys to the bathroom because they had to go really bad. Then they got locked in.\"  Now where that came from, I don't know, but I remember I was working on another one of those, and we were at the airport. My mother and I were supposed to go on a plane somewhere, I think, and I was working until the last minute to finish that thing. You know how I do sometimes. And then I had to, I really did have to go to the bathroom, and, well, come to think of it, I wasn't going anywhere with my mother; I was going with this class. And I had to go to the bathroom, and in this line of bathroom stalls, they had stalls with doors that closed, and they had empty toilets facing sideways in front of the doors. And so I sat on one of the empty toilets in front of the doors, and the door was open, and my father said, \"Try and move over in here; I've got to go too.\" And he went in the stall and closed the door, and here I am sitting on the toilet in front of the door. I guess he Athought it was more politically correct to see a woman going to the bathroom than to see a man going. And as I'm trying to go, somebody in the airport comes out and starts talking to this class about what they're going to do when and what flight they're going to take and what city they're going to stop in and giving them directions. And I noticed that they were all sitting real close to me, and I'm like in the audience. I'm just on a toilet instead. And so I'm standing up and trying to pull up my pants and I feel a little embarrassed. And then I woke up."

And there was fake snow on the ground in this one area, and there were these ducks and geese that were alive, and I couldn't figure out why I couldn't see them at first, because I could only just sort of barely make them out because I was not really that close. And then as I got closer, I realized that all the geese, their big bodies, were jammed into these little buckets, meaning their heads and their chest were sticking out, but their tail and their feet and their bottom were just squeezed and, what should I say, twisted and just shoved into these little buckets so that they couldn't get out. All they could do was just sit there and look at people, which I guess the point was they have their heads up to have them looking at people. But man, what a way to do it. And I think a few of the ducks were like that too, but there were a few of them that were free and were running around, and they were mallards. And I caught a mallard that was pretty tame, and I held it for a while and then I let it go back to the market thing. And that was one little scene. And in my dream I didn't feel too bad about it. I wanted to pull them all out and set them free, but I had a feeling like it was against the law to set them free because they were like livestock, I guess. And the next little scene was that my mother and I were in the garage and, you know, we were kind of whispering and stuff. And my father heard us whispering about how my mother thought he was going to get rid of her, and he came in and said something like, \"Oh, is that what you talk about. Why do you give her that impression?\" or something like that, and, you know, all like that. And then I think Sandra was in town and we were riding bikes or something, and her and my father were riding on the tandem and my mother and I were walking and we were just lagging way behind.

They were staying in this kind of house that wasn't ours, and it had wood floors and it had a lot of windows, but it was smaller than ours. And the main thing about this dream that I can remember right now was that Sam had this red car that was really new-fangled, and he designed this type of alarm that was to warn people around that a person was having an epileptic seizure, but in order to activate it, the windshield had to be cracked and the two front doors had to be open. And it wasn't a \"whoo whooey\" kind of sound; it was a dark, heavy -- I don't know how to describe it -- kind of lower frequency and a horn kind of an alarm. And it was a few decibels louder than the norm. And I dreamt that he was wanting to demonstrate it to everybody and everybody was wanting to see it, and they sort of told me, \"Oh, it's not going to happen. I'm just going to show you what makes it happen.\" But I knew better. I was out on the porch with them, and I opened the door and I ran in the house. And the bedroom was close to where the car was parked, so I ran in the living room, I laid face down on the couch and covered my ears. And I heard it a little bit, but it wasn't bad. Then I went back out and I think there was more to this dream in that these, this scene with the car that he had designed had something else to do with audio also, but I can't remember exactly. And it had to do with this round thing that was part of the engine, and if it got too hot, it was a problem. But I don't remember any more. Oh, and another thing was that my father took me to this place, this AT&T; place, and I took my cell phone to ask a question about something on the bill because the bill was like $96 and usually in reality it's only $26. And I couldn't figure out what in the heck was going on. And I think that was all. Now there's something else I remembered about that dream. I also dreamt that there was a white chicken and another chicken that was white with black speckles, and I realized I had a notion they had been sitting in boxes for days, live chickens just sort of confined in little cardboard boxes about twice their size. And they were light and thin, they seemed way too light for their sizes. And I figured it was high time that we let them run in the yard, and I wanted to keep a close eye on them to see if our other chickens would accept them or if they would go crazy and peck them and shoo them. And I really don't remember what happened, but I remember them walking away from the boxes and doing just fine."

And let's see, what happened first? Sheryl, Sandra, and Sam and Teresa and Paula and Pat, and they all went off to do something, and they were splashing and swimming in the springs and stuff, and tubing down the river, and my mother and my father and I were sitting at an area that really closely resembled Circle Lake Park. And we were just sitting there, like quiet, and we were just talking about different things. And we were gazing into the water and we saw these reflections in the water that were like people with instruments. And my mother said, she said, \"I saw an advertisement that was for a keyboard that could make the sound of all the instruments that were ever created, for only something like $50. Now that can't be. It would have to be really kind of cheap.\" And my father was right there, and I think she said, \"I'll show it to you, but you have to do your homework first.\" And apparently this was like back when, I don't know, but I had the notion that I had some homework to do. And it was like math, it was this really simple -- oh, before any of this -- now it's coming back to me: I dreamt that I was in a class and these college kids were so dumb, they didn't know their times tables. And this math teacher was trying to drill the times tables into these kids my age. And so, back to the scene that I was talking about, we had multiplication homework that was really basic, except in some of the problems there wasn't numbers. There were little fish symbols, and I didn't know what to make of them. And then some were normal and some were stupid things like 1 X 12 and 0 X 4 and stupid stuff like that. And also there was one really challenging one though that was 23 X 63. And I was thinking, \"Okay, how do I do this one? I don't the space to write it out, and I don't have a calculator. So, okay, I can do 9 X 23 and then do 7 X 23 and add those two numbers together and that would be the answer to what 63 X 23 is.\" And then I woke up."

I think it symbolized Lorna and Reyna and how they kind of stand together, and in my dream, instead of all the way, there was sort of a reddish colored CD called \"This is It\" with, there were two figures on the front, naked. And, of course, that doesn't actually exist, but it was right after talking about love, kind of as a farewell thing for a while. And so I was going to go over and investigate what in the world that was, and it was like a fancy, exclusive hotel with a meeting room thing, and apparently I got the notion that it was through the fundraiser thing for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

I climbed over a couple chairs and there were like four empty chairs in the front row and I took one of them.

And before she addressed the people, apparently they were taking a break or something, and she came up to the people in the front, and I said, \"I know you've heard this a thousand times, but I'm one of your biggest, most humongous fans.\" And she leaned over and the took my one hand in both of hers, and her voice was like real soft and mystery, kind of like _________ is, and I couldn't figure why that was."

He seemed satisfied. That was crazy, man.

And Angeline, the little Jehovah Witness girl, showed up in my dream and she said, she was sitting at the foot of our bed talking with us.

And mostly I've been writing them down in my journal, or rather typing them. But I feel like, for some reason or another, I need to go back to speaking on a tape. And I think that is because my writing -- I describe things differently when I write than when I speak. And for journal and for diary that's good because I like my word sense per se, my syntax. I like how I can sit and come up with vivid descriptions of things. But in my dreams some things are very vivid, and I can't describe them in words, and it's easier to describe them verbally than actually writing it down in words. Although sometimes it may be better to write them down in words because I capture more detail that way, like when I wrote about Sheryl and Sandra and Sam and I singing on stage and jumping on this trampoline, I just filled that with as many details as I could think of. And I guess I have to try to do that in my ______. And I keep saying one of these days I want to sample all these things and I want to turn them into mp3's and I want to cram tons of them on a single CD so that I don't have all these tapes laying around, and so that I can start using the tapes again to do stuff like this, because every time a thought rips me, I don't want to have to stop what I'm doing or get up in the middle of the night and go turn in my machine and grab a microphone and plug it into the mixer and go to c____ and get Pro and doot, do doot, do doot; doot, do doot, do doot. I want to grab my take machine, hit \"record\" and start saying what's on my mind or what I'm thinking before it just totally goes away. So it's better consistent, just voice, it doesn't really matter; it doesn't have that much spectrum to it. So I can use tapes to capture it and then sit around diddling, diddling and diddling and diddling after the fact.  So here we go. Last night's dream is still the clearest to me because it was the most recent and because it kind of hit my like a ton of bricks in the way. Not that heavy, but it was something that I was thinking about. I dreamt I was back home in my home town and it was like I had been away for a while, like I am, and I was coming home. And they were having a celebration for me, but it was a little pinky celebration. There was like three people there, I think Clark and Marylou and Terri. And they were just talking, there was no real party going on. But somehow my mother was riding the bike and I was sitting on her handlebars in the basket, and she was telling me that she was pregnant, and that she was having a baby. And she said that she didn't want to have to start all over again, but that my father wanted another child, and he did want to start all over again. And so she had to have this baby because he wanted one. And she said, \"I'm only going to love this baby half as much as I love you.\" And I was so sad for her because, first of all, she didn't want to start all over again. This is a time in her life where she's ready to move on and do other things, and apparently it wasn't like the regular pregnancy term. It was this deal where you get pregnant, and four or five days later the baby pops out. That was messed up, man. And then we were on -- in the last scene of that dream -- we were on the bed, and I was laying and I was talking to my mother about various things. And she was signaling to me that my father was on the other side of the bed and not to say anything really outlandish. And I looked over and I saw that he was, but in this dream that was unusual because she was on his side of the bed and he was on her side of the bed. Now his side of the bed is the closest to the short mirror dresser and the stereo receiver in the room, and her bed is closer to the upright dresser and the night stand and the air conditioner thing-a-ma-jiggy. So in my dream they were kind of reversed, and I was just kind of making up small talk. And then I woke up. Now the night before I had a dream that was real, real kind of foggy and bleah and blurry, and literally I was walking around in a blurry world. But the concept and what happened is kind of not clear either. I dreamt that we had come home from some kind of long trip and we needed to do something with Grandpa, and it was dark out. And my father was in the truck and my mother was in the car, and I was riding with my mother in the car. And my father was going to go to Home Depot and get one or two things for Grandpa and then go over to his house. And my mother said she was going to go do some grocery shopping and make some copies and this and that and the other, and she said, \"I hope you don't mind me driving around so much.\" And my father was like, \"No, that shows that you love me and you want to take care of things around the house, and for the house. And I was like, \"Wow,\" they would never say anything like that in real life. They've never been gushy over each other. And so my mother and I really were just going gallivanting, just going to do all this stuff together, and we were in this area that had woods. We stopped the car and for some reason we shut off the engine, but the headlights were still on. And she was guiding me through this banyan tree area, I think there were like several banyan trees. And there was this net, and she led me through, you know, tripping through the roots and everything, and there was a butterfly caught in the net, and it was a big butterfly, about the size of my two hands put together, if each hand was a wing. And I looked like a Monarch, and it touched it, and that helped it get out of the net and it flew off. But I felt good that I was actually able to see a butterfly. And that's all I can really remember about that dream. And the third one that was two nights ago or three nights ago, I dreamt that I was at some kind of beach with my mother and my father and Terri and a bunch of other people, and we were planning this celebration for me for some reason. I think had either graduated or had some kind of successful milestone and we were going to be in a parade, and we were going to be in a school bus in a parade. And we were organizing like the parade route and this and that and the other, and the bus driver had this really thick Spanish accent. And this lady -- I don't know who she was -- I don't know who she was, but she was very outgoing, she sounded like a cross between Terri and Serena Potter, and she was leading everybody and trying to get them to have fun and party on this bus. And you know how buses have intercom systems sometimes to talk to the passengers? Well, she was, her and another cluster of people were yelling into the microphone, saying, \"Party, yahoo!\" and stuff like that. And I'm really surprised that there was no feedback, but in this dream that law of physics was suspended, and it was funny because she aimed it at me and I was sitting like four rows back. And she said, \"Jasmine, say something!\" And I don't remember what I said, but I said something and it was amplified as though I was talking into it. And that's all I can remember about that."

And actually in this dream I was back in my home town, and I actually had to do a triangle. I had to get back over to my tech school, then over to City Airport. Somehow Mrs. Dougherty was involved, and I wanted my mother to go with me so I wanted her to chaperone this field trip. And, you know, things aren't organized like they used to be in high school, but I thought they were in this dream, and I thought we were going to have a really big bus that was going to just drive us, and my mother could sit on the bus and chaperone the trip, you know. But the only hitch here is that I couldn't find the papers that said what day that was going to be, and it was going to be on a Tuesday and in my dream I didn't know if that was going to be today or next week. And so I was afraid that I missed it. And actually when I was trying to tell my mother and my father about this, my mother was drawing something, and my father suggested putting serial numbers on the back of her painting so that if she did two or three of similar, then it would kind of add value to them.

The pool was an indoor pool with a little like greenhouse cover over it, but in order to turn the heat up in the water, what you had to do was go through a little gate, kneel down and crawl inside of a box that had all kinds of pumps and stuff in it. And you had to lay on your back and up on the roof of this box was a touch screen like the one on the keyboard in class. And what you had to do is you had to press a button and then touch a particular object on the menu, just like you do with that, and then it would come on. I was feeling really claustrophobic and I didn't know if I was going to be able to handle that. And even after I sort of did that, I came out and I looked at the pool, and I was going to go in. But I decided I wouldn't."

But I got this like get-up together that had like a black cap and a black gown from somewhere and I dressed it all up. I put all kinds of flowers on my cap, and I put all kinds of dangly, dingly things around my neck, and I went in a parade, a parade that the university was putting on, I think several universities in the area. I just paraded around and ____ the parade. And I dreamt that I had a column stand like ____ thing that I could put pens in somebody gave me as a present. And I was trying to get my mother and Allison to come, so they'd come by themselves, and that's about all I can remember. I don't know if they ever did."

And they were like at work stations, and each of us had a computer and a CC TV, believe it or not. And we really didn't need the computer for the test, and everybody was using their CC TV. And it was this third of a sheet of paper that had the answer things that you bubble in and then a full sheet of paper with the questions. And it was stuff about matching up numbers and letters and like, \"Mode E has 115 different things and Mode Z has 40 different things,\" and just stuff like that. And I think this is kind of a reflection of MIDI messages, but MIDI messages are a little more specific than that. This was just crazy stuff being thrown around. And so I did as best as I could, and some of it was even being explained to us as we were taking it, and I remember leaving the work station and going to the middle of the room and sitting down at a big roll-top desk and writing, like for some reason. I don't know what I was writing. Then I would go back and do some more of the test. And somehow that jumped to another little scene when I was done with the test. I didn't know if I was getting married or graduating or if I was just having a birthday, but I was getting these presents in my mailbox, like one person gave me a talking teddy bear with a heart. Another person gave me a little stuffed peacock that you like clip onto something. And about that time I woke up."

I dreamt that my father and my mother and I were in a hotel for some reason, and we were on some kind of business trip that they had to take care of business, and I can't remember what. But I remember my mother was taking me to an airport and she was showing me how to get around in the airport. And she was gearing me up so that one day I could fly by myself, and in my dream they were like out on the tarmac, like out where the people never go. And I could hear the planes revving up and going around and stuff, and it made me really, really sad, I think because we couldn't go to my relative's home town this year or something. I always associate lots of fun awaiting me and her, and we fly away from my home town and we go to my relative's home town and we have a vacation. And I've always loved flying just because I've done it since I was a tiny baby. And the next little scene was that we were home from the hotel and for some reason or another I left my cell phone in the hotel room. Well, first of all, we had this garbage and laundry that we had to deal with, and I guess my father wanted us to all do it in a very orderly kind of a way. I basically said, \"Well, if you and I are going to do it, I'll do whatever you want, but if he's going to be out there, I'm not doing any of it.\" And before that little scene, I remember I saw a groundhog. It looked like a miniature squirrel with no tail, and I was studying it and it was coming out of a little hole, like they do. And I dropped in a little piece of my hair to see what it would do, and it nibbled at it a little bit and then kind of spit it out.  And I watched it come out of the hole and walk on all fours and go up this hill, and I was looking at it from there with my distance aid. I could get pictures with my distance aid as if it were a camera, and I took three pictures of it. I think while I was looking at the groundhog, I was hearing somebody playing major chords somewhere, but I don't know how or why. It was just sound that was there in my dream. And the last little scene before I woke up is that I was at this CC TV and it was over in the dining room and I was back in my home town, and I had tons of academic work to do, like I had a book report to do in Spanish. And I was looking over the vocabulary list that comes with it and I had all of this other like essays and stuff to do. And I remember feeling confident that I was just going to plough on through it because I was doing it myself. Maybe that came from the fact that I saw Spanish cleaning ladies at my tech school and I talked with them, and it made me think about all the vocabulary and stuff that I haven't thought about in a while, which is good, I guess."

For some reason _____________ ________ show, and somehow _______Mrs. Dougherty really well, and through her mother got to help do some of the fashions and I got to help do some of the sound work. And so I dreamt that I was like sitting in our garage at home with Celine and she has her short hair, and she has this like thing that's kind of like a guitar amp, but it could amplify any signal, in this case either her voice or somebody else's. And it had most of her reverb settings and program that she has to go through, kind of like the ones in school and how I have such trouble with them because they have everything that you need to know in this display that I can barely read. So ____ program 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -- well, she was 4 or 5 and was getting these weird swirly kind of chorus effects, and she said, \"How can I get none of this? How can I get back to having nothing?\" And I suggested going back to program #1 and that works. And she has this other little thing with tons of reverb in it too, and we really couldn't turn it off.  That was strange. And the next scene we were at my high school and I think my mother was sewing or something and she was laying on the couch. And I was getting ready for class and I was in Mrs. Dougherty's class again, and we were talking about bars and beats and stuff, and this time I was one of the misbehaving and acting up ones for some reason because my mother was there and every time I thought of something, I wanted to tell her something. And [sigh] I don't remember too much more of how that unfolded. But one of the crazy parts was that there were these little figurines that she passed out of like Celine in different costumes because we were analyzing how the costumes made the mood of the show change. And I said to my mother, \"If there's any extra figures laying around that people like throw on the floor or something, pick them up for me.\" You know, they were like leprechauns that you put in cupcakes, and I had one of her in the red. And then I woke up. That was crazy, but I think it has something to do with getting into the production side of things now and how things that become big don't really appear big to the team that's putting them on. And even if they are big, they don't treat everything as though it's going to be big. They go and they do their thing among themselves."

She was interested in it, I guess, because she could use it to help her business put presentations and stuff together. And I was trying to teach her about wave form editing. She didn't really get it at the seminar, so I offered to have her come back here and I was going to teach her some about it. I had this program that kind of worked like Cool Edit Pro, but it looked like Digital Performer. There was a white background, black glaze, and in some cases the waves really looked like audio waves, but in other cases they were just g___ of a sign wave, like up and down and up and down like in the form of a sign wave. And I couldn't figure out why that was, but somehow it was working for us.

It's okay.\" I got real close to her like I do with my mother and I kissed her. And she kind of wiped her tears away and everything, and then I went back to editing sound with Aunt Janice, and she was looking around my room while I was doing all that, and I had these weirdo little things around. And I had this tall, skinny extra, extra-exaggerated statue of Pluto that she was looking at, and I had this blue cow statue with a yellow bow on its collar. Actually it wasn't a statue; it was a cut-out out of felt. And she said, \"Oh, you have the blue cow. I love blue cows.\"  And she wanted me to record her talking about the cow statue into my editing program so that we could learn about editing using that audio. And that's about all I can remember."

I really didn't want to go to them. I had a class that started at 5:00 and ended at 9:00, just like I do at my tech school. But it was about history or something. And I was explaining about how my mother and my father were going off and that they were going to be doing some errands so they could bring me there, but that I was going to have a cab bring me home. And while I was there, I was staying at this like commons dorm-like type thing instead of at the house, and I had my own room with a bed like I do here, and I had to go to another place to take a shower. And I took my shower, well, before I took my shower, I was on the couch with two girls and a boy. They had this thing that belonged to one of the girls, and this is whacko. What it was, was like something that sort of looked like the two microphones that we were talking about in class, but it was more like this kind of hypnotist therapy thing where you hypnotize people with it. And what it did is that it sends out a certain electrical field, sort of you hold it and you swirl it around someone's head so that the electrical field sort of whirls around their head and relaxes and hypnotizes them and whatever. And it would also create the sound of certain musical notes as you hold it close or further away from somebody's head, kind of like a Theremin. You could change the strength of the electrical field. They were all teasing around like teenagers do. This boy decides he's going to try it on me. It's okay at first, but then he's holding it a little too close to my head and it's not good, so I'm trying to take his hand and make him back it away. In doing that, I bumped the switch to change the electrical field, and then it was really strong and making all these arching sounds, and I couldn't stand it. And I think I finally got away from him and got into the shower place and got my shower. And when I was done there, I had to get back to my dorm room and I was totally naked. And in this place it was okay to run totally naked from the shower to your dorm room, but I couldn't find my dorm room. All these little hallways and things that I would run down, and I would open the door and it would be somebody else's room with somebody else's stuff, and I would go to another place that I thought was mine, and there were two boys watching TV. And I closed the door and they didn't say anything like about they saw me or anything, but I woke up without ever finding my room, I guess."

In my dream we were close to water, and at these peoples' place they had this house and they had this pool and then in the back they had a boat, but it was more like a big, big ship. This place was close enough that I could walk from my apartment. And so Jill and I walked over and once we got there, we kind of like parted ways, like we wouldn't be together. And I walked around and I looked at things. I walked around the pool and I was careful not to fall in because it was actually kind of cold, but I went in these scruffy-looking shorts and this pink sweater with gold sleeves. It was still kind of tame; people were getting ready, but the bride hadn't changed yet. She was still in like beach clothes, and I didn't even know who she was. I didn't know why anybody was. And, but they were real warm and friendly. They seemed to know me real well. I think a girl and her father and the son were kind of milling around. Nobody had already changed yet. They did a little bit of stuff and I was thinking how, man, it would have been so nice if I could have the Peavey system and DJ for them. I was thinking how I couldn't have gotten it from my home town to here and here to there in an hour, so that was kind of a lost cause. After a while, when everybody went to change, I went back to my apartment to change into shorts, and I didn't know what happened to Jill. She must have went off with some other people or something. And I put long pants on and kept my pink sweater with the gold sleeves.  At that time I think they were like starting to serve some food and I got a little bit, and then they were going to take everybody on the ship for the actual party. They didn't actually do any exchanging of vows or anything. They just had like a reception party, and everybody was changed into their clothes and everybody was all authentic and everything, and we were on this big ship. It reminded me of the Prince Eric ship. And I went out on -- it wasn't tall like the Titanic, but it sure was long -- and I went out on the deck and I sat out there to look out on the water. In my dream I feel asleep, and I fell asleep while all the partying was going on. Whoever was captaining the ship came to get me to say that he had come back to dock and that it was time to go back to the house. And he was real nice and, you know, when I step on and off of a boat, I have to take somebody's hand, and he gave me both hands like I need and he kind of helped me get on dry land. And then when I went into the house, my mother was there, and she was helping them pick up the food and clean up everything, and I didn't get to have any wedding cake because I was asleep, and so she gave me some. And there was this milk bottle thing that I felt was going to have milk in it and so I poured some in a cup and I was going to have cake and milk, but instead what it was, was some kind of cleaning stuff and I took a sip and I was like, \"Bleah!\" and it was a good thing I didn't swallow. .... Hey, that was perfect timing. Did you hear how that tape didn't flip until I was done? I've never had good timing like that before. Let me just sure things happened when they were supposed to.... And the night before I had a dream that I didn't get a chance to put on the tape, that I will now. Kind of goofy. I dreamt that I was still in the middle of my program at my tech school, but it was Christmas again already. My mother and my father and Sandra, and I think Sheryl and Sam, were coming to visit me. And my room was a little bigger than it actually was, and I had wooden floors in this place, and it was kind of dark. And I had the two _____ was plugged in, and I had the angels and swan thing on my dresser, like I do. We were all sitting around in here. There weren't enough chairs so everybody was on the floor in the space in front of my bed, over by the computer table and the dresser, the big open area. We were all sitting around in a circle in that area. We were talking about how we were going to go from my place to my home town in a whole like caravan train and my mother and my father were doing to drive their car and Sheryl and Sam were going to go in theirs and Sandra was going to go in hers, and we were going to just do a caravan train. And we were bringing a bunch of furniture and stuff with us, as though I were going to move back. My mother had brought me the cheap TV trays like she told me she was going to, but when we went back to my home town, she brought them back. And in my dream we were going to bring all my Christmas decorations and things, for what reason I don't know. And without my really knowing, my mother packed my keyboard in the stuff to go home. When we got home, she set it up on the kitchen table, with the tablecloth folded back, and she wanted me to play her a song while she was wrapping Christmas presents. And I kind of kept procrastinating and dawdling a little because I knew that everybody was outside and they were going to come in the back door and they were going to start parading through the kitchen any minute. And so, sure enough, they did and I told my mother, \"Come one, we've got to flip the tablecloth down.\" And so she flipped the tablecloth down and nobody saw anything and they paraded through the kitchen. In my dream they didn't even have a Christmas tree up yet because something sad happened and she didn't get to put it up. So I don't remember, I think we were going to do something like that. And that was really all I can remember."

But I kind of, somebody told me that this was normally a Pro Tools lab, but it was going to be a lecture room for today. And we were having a lecture about Midi (?) and they were going to play us this sequence and solo out different parts, and have us listen to the way the different parts combine, and they did some of that. And -- oh, next thing I know, all of these people are at our house in my home town and we're, the instructor is there and everybody is there, and we're trying to build this same sequence and they have like a synthesizer, I guess. For this part when we were in our living room, it was this big stocky synth in the middle of our rug and everybody was all crowded around. And next when my mother and my father walked in [part unhearable] and there was like a bunch of stuff, and they just basically did some cleaning up and all because all of us are really into what we're doing. Oh, and the next part is really good. I dreamt that it was time for me to be in lab, and so I was in lab. And my mother was there with me so that when I need to find something on the screen and I didn't know where it was, she would point it out to me. And when I work on the computer and my mother is there, I'm really lazy because there's something that I want to find, like a document or something and I open the folder and I say, \"Okay, where is this?\" and she points to it and I go right to it so I don't have to, because I could find it myself, but I just say, \"Okay, where is this?\" and she points to it and I go right to it and we go from there. So I dreamt that she was there doing that for me in lab, and it was really crazy because we had to go to the start menu and select various views or sections for various examples, and I was having a hard time selecting the right one. And each one had like something different on the desktop and then when I opened up the sequence program, she would help me find certain little things that I needed to find. I don't remember what program we were using, but I just remember being glad that she was there. And then after a while she went to sit in the back of the room, and chat away with the instructor just like she used to do when I was in middle school or high school sometimes. And then I woke up."

I dreamt that I had to give Christine a flower arrangement. I guess it was for her graduation or her birthday or something. I didn't really want to because she was being a conceited snob to me. Now Christine usually is okay to us, but I hear that she can be quite a snob, so I guess that's what this is based on. And it was just like three roses and some other flowers, so went over to, it turns out that it's not Christine, it's Jill. And Jill had a thought that she wanted me to hold the g_____ while she taped, and I did that and she thanked me and she was surprised. And, let's see what I remember. Oh, we were sitting in the living room, my mother and I, and we were eating this crazy pudding-like type dessert with Cheerios thrown in it. And my mother said that that was something that Elizabeth used to do. And I dreamt that that evening Elizabeth had invited us to go to her house, and my mother and I were going to kind of sneak out the back door and walk over there.  I don't think we ever made it over there, but she was saying how she was going to give us root beer floats and stuff. And the last scene is that I was on a playground at a school, I think, and there was a boy about 10 or 11 and he wanted me to tell him the difference between a May (?) controller and an arranger model.

I read my Media and Society book with my eyes, not with App Reader on the CD Rom, so that I'd get really tired and really bored and I'd start going to sleep like I'm supposed to. But I don't know, stuff just started getting back into my head, and I started getting all excited, like I did.  I remember the goosey dream that I had last night. I dreamt that it was Christmas time again, of all things, and my mother and my father were coming to visit me and I got a week off for Christmas in this dream.

And so the scenario, the little scene that I remember the best is that I had a picnic lunch and I was sitting down on the curb in the parking lot and I was eating it. And I packed it all away, I took my shoes off and put them in my book bag, and it had just rained, so I was going to walk home barefoot and slop and splash in the all puddles like I still like to do. I hate getting my feet wet if I'm wearing any kind of shoes, but if I'm barefoot, I love to slop and splash in puddles. And as I was going through the first puddle, I woke up."

And I've been laying here all this time thinking about it and how I need to write a song about it.

And I dreamt that my mother and my father went somewhere, and I was back at my home town in their house, and I had been on a walk with them and I came home early, and the neighbors stopped them or something and were talking to them. And I thought there were some birthday presents on the kitchen table, so for some reason or another, I climbed up on the kitchen stool over by the refrigerator and it turned into this like tall ladder. And there was this rafter beam that went the length of the kitchen, that really isn't there, but it was there in my dream. And I got on my hands and my knees and I crawled across that rafter beam, and then I kind of swung myself down off of it and put my feet on one of the kitchen chairs, because I thought if I would just walk, then I would leave footprints and then they would know I'd been over there. And it turned out there weren't any presents on the table. It was just a vase of flowers. And I didn't seem to mind that there weren't any presents though. I was just curious to know if there were any. Then I went upstairs and I was looking around for my MiniDisc recorder, because I had a feeling they were planning a party, and I couldn't find it. I had a feeling my mother like unpacked my bags and put all my stuff all over the stuff like hide and seek. And so then I started looking for this tape machine as an alternative, and I couldn't find it either, and I knew I had brought both of them when I came. Then all of a sudden there were these people downstairs, a bunch of our neighbors and friends that were all coming over and they were ready for a party, and we were going to have a birthday party with them. And it was a surprise party that they sort of sprung. And I looked really ______ around the house for either my MiniDisc recorder or my tape machine because I couldn't let this event go by. And I couldn't find them, and then like three minutes went by, and I decided, okay, I'd better give it up and go down and join the party and just let my memory do the recording. So I went down and by that time there were only like two people left. It's like everybody came, they shuffled through, they whooped and whooped and partied it up, and like three minutes later they were gone. And by the time I got downstairs there was no party; I had missed the party. And it was just my father and these two people. And pretty soon the two people left too and it was just my mother and my father and me. And for some reason I was sitting on the floor near the receiver in the living room and the CD player over there, and they were on, but there was nothing coming out of them. My father was giving one of his long spiels about something again. I think it was about, hmmm, I can't even remember what it was about, but it was about something stupid, I think. And I was thinking how I really would want to be at a birthday party instead of sitting there listening to all that. And then I woke up."

But I remember first that I dreamt that I was here and that Jill's parents were coming to take care of a signature she needed on a check or something. And she was vacuuming my room with a little dust buster thing that made kind of a high squeaky kind of sound, and when they walked in, everybody said, \"Hi.\" And I said, \"Hi\" back. And she said, \"I know Jasmine will enjoy having you.\" If they really were coming, I would have enjoyed having them. And before that, I think I was back in my home town and I was standing on the back hallway, I actually was in the kitchen looking out at the back hallway and there was a kitchen standing in the back hall, looking in at us. I remember saying something like, I don't remember, I think we were going to go somewhere and do something, I don't know. After that we were in this fancy restaurant with a family that we knew. I think it was Elizabeth's family. It was my mother and my father and I and Elizabeth, and we were eating this fancy food. I had this little stuffed dog that I was thinking of buying from the restaurant, and it was $90. And then I decided, that is ridiculous. I am leaving that darned thing. Before all that I have a vague memory that I dreamt that I was in this, in the area, in the balcony area that overlooked like this big open space. I was up there with a few other people and Alex was setting up this live rig and he was going to give a demonstration to people that gathered down in the open space. I think I was standing around in the way watching. He had a mixer and a big, heavy PA system, and that's about all I can remember."

I dreamt that my mother actually did come up here Sunday before my birthday, and the first little scene was we were kind of in my neighborhood here, I guess, somewhere where there's a big open field. There really isn't any, but I _______. That's funny. I don't know why I said that, but we were in my neighborhood here and there was a big open field and we were running in it, and we were kind of running and chasing each other, kind of like what we did in the park one day. And she was planning this surprise for me, and it turns out that her and my father were taking me to this place where you could experience virtual reality, and it's like the big high whoo-whoo, or it's supposed to be anyway. And I got there and all it is, all the hype that it is, is that you sit down in a chair with an orange light and it kind of skates around the room a little and there's these sounds that play. And like about after ten minutes of that, everybody was like, \"Wowowowow.\" I don't know. And then in the next little scene it's like totally out of context, but I was in that same place, but it looked like the MIDI lab at my tech school with fluorescent lights blasting on everybody, because in the MIDI lab they keep really dim lighting so that if you need to see your monitor ___________ and stuff. But in here the fluorescent lights were bright, and nobody had moved the monitor for me or anything, but I still had to do my assignment. And there was this man, this really prissy man in a tuxedo, sitting next to me with a tie, and I had to tell him everything that I wanted to do, and how I wanted to do it. And he would interface with the machine and do it for me. And on the one hand, that was a way I could work, but on the other hand, it pretty much took all the creativity out of it because you were working through a medium pretty much. I mean I guess here is that [sigh], I don't know, it's just not good when you've got to work through somebody else. And then my father showed up and we went to this theme park, and I think it was Disneyland, but in my dream theme parks we don't really do that much. I think that I was on a roller coaster or something. And that's about all I can remember."

            "content": "I don't know why I'm getting like this, but this morning when my alarm came on, I jumped up and I was kind of afraid that, I got real nervous because I thought I missed the lab. And it took me a minute to remember and sort out the confusion that Sunday night I got to sleep all night and this is Monday morning, and that Monday night was going to be my next lab. And I had to remember that Saturday night was my last one. I hope I don't do that next month if my labs are during the day. That's going to be crazy. But anyway, I had a dream last night that I had a class on the second floor of my tech school's building, which in Building 1 there aren't that many classrooms on the second floor. There's mainly administrative offices up there. But in my dream there was like classroom after classroom just like there is in a public school. And so I had a class up there and we were doing some kind of droop (?) work and all of a sudden we had a fire drill and it sounded like a high, shrill 1000 cicadas kind of alarm that you hear at the Media Building at my high school. And so there was this fire escape like type thing that was this metal stairway thing that led out the back way that we could go down. And it was so loud back there! I think I might have covered my ears, and it was still so loud, but not only was the alarm loud, there was some kind of water sprayer going on out there that was really loud. And then all of a sudden it all stopped, but there was like water at the bottom of the stairwell that would beep, and you had to swim across it to go to the little field area where you were supposed to stand. And I didn't really have a problem swimming; it was that the water smells and I didn't want to swim in the smelly water and get it all over me. So I got down in it and I went a little ways, and then I turned around because I decided that I didn't want to, and I was going to go back up the stairs and wait for people on the stairwell. All of a sudden all of these thorns started showing up on the railings and some even on the steps, so I figured, okay, I guess I'm, I waffled for a little bit, and I think I finally went over to this place where people stand. And then the whole class was gone. There was just one or two girls over there, and they were talking about how they made a pregnant Barbie or something, but they had to make a rap song along with it that proved its father was there somewhere. And they made a DVD about it too.  And that's when I woke up."

But it's summer time and we all know what happens in the summer time, so I should starting expecting it, I guess. Last night I had a dream that I was back in my home town and it was Easter time, but for some reason it was real cold outside, as though it were winter, and we had to put on jackets before we went outside. And I think either my mother or my father -- no, it was some guy that was our neighbor -- wanted to take our pictures out there while I was home, and so we had to bundle all up and go out there. There was a swing out there that was built like Grammy's, where there weren't chains hanging from a tree; they were just hanging from a little, teensy metal thing at your head level. And, you know, they had gardens and flowers and stuff, and eggs hidden in various places, and I don't understand why it was so cold, but the scenery looked like spring. And we had a baby chick running around, a bunny running around, you know, like we used to have rabbits galore, except this rabbit was crazy. It was a live, running around rabbit, but you would pet it, like you would pet its head and it would say something. Or you would pet its back and it would say something. And I had the notion that they genetically engineered it like that, and I kind of thought that was so wrong. I thought rabbits are supposed to be rabbits in their own little right, their own little creature, and their body language should convey what they mean. And we shouldn't go messing with them like that. But that was like off the wall, man! And I know there was so more to this dream; let me think a minute. The only other thing I can remember is that I think Sandra showed up somewhere in this, and I had like a big, flat briefcase full of my school papers that I was showing to this neighbor. One other thing that I should note here: the rabbit that was whacko was a white one, and it was the size and weight and everything of just a regular bunny running around, that you get at the pet store. And the baby chick was yellow. I don't know if that means anything, but I've heard that colors are very significant, so I thought that I would include that."

But this is what I do remember: I dreamt that I was back in the Media Lab at my tech school and I was taking my test out, just like I did the day before, except there was this man there that was like a cross between Christian Keene and Alec. He was like the course director who was giving the lab test, instead of the lab guys. And what we had to do for test, instead of being able to navigate through the software and know what to do to make what goes ding-a-ling or whatever, we had to actually, we had to play competently into the sequencer and make a coherent musical sequence and know what notes were and stuff. And if you couldn't do that, then our test was like \"pffffffff.\" And around -- this room was like really big, there were like forty lab stations in it, and it looked different than the one that we have. Instead of being kind of angled back like ours is, this one was straight up, like everything was pretty much straight on top of each other, and the monitor was like, the base of it was at my forehead level. And so I sat down and I started doing what I could do, and I couldn't get any notes to come out of the thing. It was like it was some kind of synthesizer was on this patch that had like crazy sound effect noises like police sirens and frizzy \"aaaaash\" sounds and trash cans opening and dumb things like that. And around me taking the test were little kids, like 5 and 6-year-olds and they knew what they were doing right away and everything. And they seemed to really enjoy it. And I think there was something else in this dream that touched a chord with me, but I don't remember what it was now. That's kind of a bummer."

Well, now I see that it's going again, so now I can start blabbing away again. Well, I guess this is take 2. It's my birthday. I'm going to party like it's my birthday. I really can't party like it's my birthday, but I wish I could. But I had an interesting dream last night that I still can remember a lot of the details. And so I figure I may as well just break open a new tape and start recording it. I dreamt that I was having classes back at my high school, but two of them were my my tech school classes and two were just \"blah\" General Ed classes. I think I dreamt that I had Audiotronics, Media and Signing, Spanish and PE, and I had Spanish with Mrs. Schmidt, and I was there my first day and I had Spanish first period. And let's see. I was doing some kind of book work for her. I think I was doing like a test or something that was like four pages long, and I only got through the first page and a half of it, and the other people had to turn it in right away and she was real serious about it, but she said I could come in later and finish it. And when I left there, went to another class, I can't remember what it was, but I didn't have my printed schedule yet because the system was so screwed up and they weren't ready to give them out. So I had these other two classes that I kept missing because I didn't know what time they were being held and what time I was supposed to be there. So I thought I was going to call the school and say, \"Hey, look, what's going on with this? I have two classes but I keep missing them.\" And then I realized that I lost my book bag and my purse and I was walking around and walking around campus. And the way the campus looked is that it had one building that looked a lot like a house because it had bedrooms up top and like a student lounge thing that I wandered into, and it had a TV and a pool table and a couch and things. But at the student lounge area I didn't notice right away, but there was this steep ramp down and I slid and tripped and ended up falling flat on my face. And I got up and sort of climbed my way back up. And then I went up the stairs and went into this bedroom, and there was nobody in there. I kept walking around and around these halls asking people if they'd seen my book bag, and then I went home and I realized that my book bag and my purse were both under the gardenia bush by our back window, our back door. So then I laid a towel down in the yard and I called my high school with my cell phone and I talked to Mrs. Lipp, and I was saying, \"I've got these other two classes that I keep missing because I don't have my schedule yet. Can you please tell me what time they're going to meet?\" And I woke up before she could tell me. That was crazy."

So let me try to kind of recount this dream. I'm stopping now and taking time to record it because it keeps popping into my head. It's been popping into my head all day, so I figured it must be worth it. It isn't just going to go away and leave me alone. Let's see, I dreamt that I was at the park with my mother and my father at home and I was coloring these dinosaurs. And I was mainly coloring a stegosaurus and I was going to make the body green and the spikes yellow. And I had the notion that it was going to be a design for a robot dinosaur and it was going to be mechanical. And I was also trying to do math problems. They were simple addition and subtraction problems that were six digits, four whole numbers and then two decimal places. And my mother said I should do these math problems so that I would be able to balance my checkbook better. And I kept doing mistakes, like I couldn't do my subtraction really well on the first one, and on the second one I subtracted the cents and added the dollars.  I don't think I've done that in a while actually. Then the next thing I was riding in a truck with my father, and he was going to drop me off in another part of the park, a part where I could walk home from. And he was playing a tape. The truck radio in real life has a tape deck in it, but the tape deck has never ever, ever, ever been used. And I don't even dare put a tape in it because I'm afraid it'll eat it as those things do. Well, in my dream my father was playing a tape in the truck and it was this instructional story tape of how to put digital robot dinosaur together that I was trying to do. And it had some really soft and sweet music on it, and it was really an interesting thing to listen to. And it sort of just had that soft sound appeal that I like. He dropped me off and I had my portable tape player. Actually it was a big heavy one from APH in the talking book library, and he gave me the tape out of the front of the unit, and he said, \"No, here, wait a minute. Let me rewind it.\" So I sat there with the door open for a minute while he rewinded it, I mean he rewound it -- what am I saying? I'm tired, can you tell? Then I got out and I started walking towards the tree where I was going to sit down and listen to the tape, and then I realized that this tape player that I had needed batteries and I didn't have any. And then I woke up."

            "content": "It's evening time again. I don't know why I wait until evening to do these lately, I guess because I was pretty \"bleah\" this morning and I had a lot of stuff on my mind, and I guess I just didn't remember the dream very much this morning. And as I went on through the day, subtle things kept popping back to me -- things that I saw, things that heard -- and by the end of the day I put it together as a puzzle and only certain parts, though, are kind of clear. And so I'll tell what I remember. I dreamt that, well, first of all, there's several little things that are coming together here. This dream takes place in the area that is the shopping zoo that I cross every day to go to my tech school, basically the whole area between the AT&T; place and the Dollar Store. But in my dream around the U, instead of being stores, there were classrooms, and these classrooms were where we were going to have some of our classes. And the doors were white with clear glass panes up at like the chest level, and the arch just like all the doors that my high school had, you know, like my Spanish classroom and the door to the Little Theater and the door to this and the door to that. They were all like that. Well, that's how these doors were. And I had the notion that the material that was going to be taught in these classes was my tech school's material, but they were treating us like we were elementary school students, like, for example, when we went to lunch we had to walk in a straight line to go to the cafeteria. But other than that, they pretty much treated us like adults. There was this Spanish lady and this man and they were like team teaching, you know how in lab there are several people and they are all kind of teaching at once. And this class was going to be kind of like Song Craft, but instead of just knowing what the song was about and analyzing it, you had to actually perform something original. You could either stand up in front of the class and sing, or you could beat on the board or you could kind of clap your hands or something, but you had to go up there and do something. And so I was pretty kind of interested because there were these four boys, one of them had like a little, like a tiny like kids' toy drum set. I think one of them was going to play a trombone or something and three of them each had keyboards. And I think there was another one that was going to sing. And these people, I guess they were going to take their turn going up there and plugging into the sound system and getting everybody's attention or something. And they sent me to go and get something from across the U, and so they took their time fiddling around and I think they needed to wait for somebody to unlock the door, so I got on this chair that you roll around in, like a chair that you find in labs that you just roll around the room in, except this chair was orange. And I rolled this chair all the way across the U over to the other side, and I just sat there. And I sat there and I sat there and I sat there, and I didn't even remember what I had to go and get. And then I looked at the time and I was like, \"Oh, my gosh!\" and I had to zoom back. So I rolled my little orange chair across that parking as fast as I could to get to the other side of the U. And it turned out that everybody had already performed and I had totally missed all the performances because I dawdled too long. And all the guys with their instruments were walking out of the room. And I think I have to make a note here that the toy drum set was orange, and the three guys who had keyboard cases were orange too. Their cases were orange. And I was thinking, \"Oh, man, that's just a bummer. I wish I could have heard these guys.\" And then I sort of faded into consciousness, gradually, as I was still seeing orange things. And then I realized it wasn't such a bummer because it was all just a stupid dream."

First I dreamt that my mother and I were riding around these antsy parking lots on the bike and she went to Public to do some shopping, and she took some of Public's cards and was going to hand them out at the fruit stand. And Publics gave her three Easter baskets because of that. One was kind of a normal one, one was small, kind of like, and the other one was really small. And in the really small one there was a ducky and these four or five little clips that you clip bags together closed with, but she called them short-its, and when I thought these short-it things were, were things that you strip away some of the wire and you put this clip there, so that when somebody steps on it, it shorts out the circuit and goes, \"Ahhhhhhhhh!\" That's funny. And so we rode the bike home, happy because we had all these Easter baskets and all these presents we were going to send people. And we got home and the front door was wide open, and now we're talking about back in my home town and that's like a major crime there. And the chicken was around pecking at some bread that was really, really moldy, and there was a bunch of garbage laying around the yard. And my father was so sad about the fact that there was so much garbage around the yard and the chicken had moldy bread, and that the house hadn't been swept in a week. And he was just so like in a blue funk, like he gets, except he was so down that he was questioning the quality of his life. And I said something to him, I think, and he just came back with some stupid comment, which he has been known to do that after my mother and my father had had a falling out and I say something about going on and doing something else, he'll come back with some really stupid comment sometimes.  But anyway, in this dream I just went on about my business and I was sitting in the porch swing kind of talking to the bird, I guess, and then he came by and said, \"You know, I think I know what would really make me happy. I would like to take a VCR to the park and watch an instructional video about adjusting brake alignment.\" And he said that there was something in an engine called the equalizer adjustment. And I had the notion that it didn't have to do with sound, but it had to do with the equalizing of how the parts lined up, kind of like timing is for real. But I thought it was strange that there was something termed like that in an engine, and so what would make him happy was to take a VCR to the park and watch a video about calibrating an engine basically. And so, now in real life, I don't think that would do the trick. I'll take a moment to tell a story here. In real life, when we were coming home from Janna's wedding, that trip was the most awful trip I can remember in my life, and my father was laying in the back seat and my mother was driving, and I was sitting up front with her. And when we stopped at a rest stop to eat some picnic, he turned his back and wouldn't even touch any of the food or water that we were putting out, and when somebody came over to ask him about the car, he was like, \"Yeah, thanks.\" And usually he's all excited and wanting to show them what's what, and wanting to ask them about the one they used to have. But this time he was like, \"Yeah, thank you.\" So back to this dream. I think I said everything, and I think the reason why I'm thinking about, oh, I think the reason why I'm thinking about the word \"equalizer\" as being a part of an engine is because we had analog tape cal (?) lab last night, and it took me a while to understand that the tape EQ pot thing was really just an up or down boost for 10k only, and when you feed 10k through from the mil, you got to tweak the 10k thing so it'll be even all around, you know what I mean? That's all."

And I lived here, and in my dream the night before I was supposed to leave, I decided I was going to turn on my sound system and blast some classic rock kind of stuff. And I didn't think Jill was here; it was like 12:30 at night. And so I blasted it, and then five minutes later I realized that she might be here and she might be sleeping. Now this is all in my dream, you know. And so I turned it down, but I couldn't get it to go quiet enough, so I turned it off. And I laid back down and Jill came and knocked on my door and said, \"Are you ready to wake up now?\" And so they got me up again. I dreamt that she was going to Spain with me. So we packed, we kind of packed our stuff together, and then I guess Jill turns into Astrid somehow and I dreamt that Astrid was going with me. Maybe _____ there were these other people. And I dreamt that these different teachers were driving students to the airport. There was this big open field where we were standing waiting to go, and I was pretty sad about leaving for some reason. I was kind of excited and sad at the same time, but I was telling my father how the last time I was gone, one month kind of felt like two years, and I was saying how I was going to be sad about not hearing any English for a while. And I don't know, he said something like, I don't know, something in _____ forgot what it was now. And so me and these three other people piled into Mrs. H.'s car. I was in the front, Astrid and two 10-year-old boys were in the back, even though this was supposed to be high school students. I don't know how me and two 10-year-olds got to go, but it was something. And we started driving down the road, down these rural country roads, looking at this rural scenery on the way to the airport. And she said, \"What radio station do you guys like to listen to?\" And I like ________. This 10-year-old boy said that there was one called \"Blah\" and it was just sort of like a version of 93.3 in my home town where they talk a lot, so we listened to that for a while. And then she flipped over to something on am for a while. And then we were at this rest stop, and so we're still on the way to the airport, we're at a rest stop, though. And I have a handful of money. I have some American quarters, two American dimes, two American pennies and two 200 poseida (?) coins. Boy, I'm wasting tape here; oh well. And I'm standing at this rest stop and everybody's kind of going and doing their thing. And the 10-year-old boy suddenly turns into a 16-year-old and he gets out of Mrs. H.'s car and Mrs. Hollander gives him a coupon for beer, but she says, \"Now you must come back with non-alcoholic beer.\" And I'm standing there and everybody's running off and I feel kind of sad still, and my mother shows up at this rest stop. And I'm standing there and I'm kind of leaning on her, like I do, and telling her all about how I feel and stuff. And she's kind of there like saying goodbye, and then she said, \"Hey, come on. Come with me because I need to surprise you.\" When we were at the place where the cars and the buses pull in, there's like a busy road, and on this busy road there's this place for walkers. It's like a revolving door, but it's not. It's like a track, a people mover that's only very, very narrow that you have to step on, and it curves you around across the street in kind of a curved shape, and it's supposed to keep you from getting hit by cars when you cross the street. And it had this thing between the place where the vehicles in and all of the like drink stands and stuff at the restaurant. So my mother says, \"Hey, come with me.\" And she thinks she's going to cheer me up by taking me over to this drink stand and buying me a Slurpy. And actually I was going to buy it with my 200 poseida (?) coin, but we were still in America. I don't understand that. So she hurried across this thing and she forgot that I can't jump on this thing without somebody helping me. It's like, whenever I get on a boat, I always have to have somebody take my hands and kind of make sure I don't step in the water, instead of, you know, it's a thing about depth perception. And so I'm standing there and I'm standing there and I'm waving my hand and yelling for help, for somebody to help me get across this thing so that we'd still have some time to drink our Slurpy before we had to get on the road. And I drop my 200 poseida coins in the mulch and I'm waving my hands and yelling for somebody to help me, and this nice boy who was getting off the thing helps me get on it, like takes my two hands and helps me step the right distance, and he even picks up my 200 poseida coins and gives them back to me. As I jump on this thing and I almost fell backwards, and I grab the person in front of me's shoulders just so that I could keep my balance and not fall off. And I'm on this thing and I'm almost to the Slurpy stand, and then I woke up."

I had this really big over-sized storybook with like 20 point font in them, and they were all laying around the living room, and I don't remember why, but we were sitting in the living room talking about things that when the police are going by in the parade they would look for. And what kind of a red flag go up with FBI agents. One of the things that my father said that he would find commonly in the department is that when somebody sends an SOX message, the police and the FBI would think they would mix it up with some other kind of message that would mean that they're getting ready to have a plot to blow something up or something. You know that an SOX message really is the start of exclusive ______. When somebody's sending SISEX messages, but apparently it had the certain number of zeros and ones that just matched up to something bad in this dream. And I don't know where that would come from, but then the next part of this dream, I was upstairs in the bathroom and I had a silver mixer. It was like shiny silver and the faders were g____ silver. It was just all silver and it had little LEDs on it that would come on when a certain channel was active. So I sat this silver mixer on one TV tray and I set up the keyboard on two more TV trays, and I think I had some kind of other, I think I set up the CD player on the floor and ran wires to it all. And I don't remember why I did that. I don't know how I was going to amplify it in the bathroom either, but I think my mother just wanted to see how it was set up. And then we were upstairs on the little landing area hallway, and that old CC TV was still over there, and I had this big over-sized storybook about The Night Before Christmas, I guess, and I was reading it there and my mother was reading it out loud, like as I moved the tray across and I chose a word, she would read them out loud. And my father was coming up the stairs wondering what we were doing, and my mother was like, \"We're reading a story about Santa Claus.\" And I was kind of embarrassed because this was the middle of the year and Night Parade time.

And I had _______ because they were blocking the way, and then there was a school bus dropping kids off at that hour, and as the bus stopped I kind of ran ahead of it so I could get by all the commotion. And then, when I got back, the next little scene was that it was daytime and for some reason my father had to go out of town to deal with something with Jack and Polly, I think, and I think Carl was over here at my home town helping us out with some things around the house while he was away. And I think my mother was going to hang some wash outside and she wanted us to play a tape for her in the bedroom out the window like you do so that she could hear it out there. Now in my dream by the bedroom receiver there was still a tape deck, and for some reason Carl was sitting in the bedroom and he wanted me to go ahead and put it on, but then he started to work with it, and when he turned it on, it was on tuner and it was on like 94.1 or something, but he said that a message popped up and then displayed that said, \"Low power, do not adjust the volume.\" And he said that it translates to that the whole house was on less than 110 volts and that the power company had somehow messed up there. And Carl went to go tell her that, and he called her Nimp. He said, \"Nimp, guess what?\" In real life he doesn't; he calls her Evelyn or something like that. And just about that time I woke up."

This morning I was having little dreams that I was naked in here and I was walking around and that I had my door open and Jill's parents were cooking some food out in the kitchen. Jill came in here, she was wearing all black, which she never does, and she came in here and she started digging through my stuff in the closet.

And I decided okay, it was time to get dressed, and I got dressed, and she came back and she started digging through stuff on my desk. And I was pretty upset, but I didn't say anything.

And the thing with this train is, just like the real one, in order to start it and stop it, you had to flip a switch on the side of the engine, and in order to stop it or something, you had to do it while it was moving, so it was an act of catching it. But there was this other little thingy on the engine that would have 20 or 30 different patch sounds saved, just like on a keyboard in MIDI or something, except these were patch sounds of combinations of train sounds like a train would make while it's going down the track. And there was a certain patch that would make it go, \"Beep beep beep\" as it was going forward, but when you'd make it go backwards, it would be the scary back-up alarm sound like, \"Doo do, doo do,\" and I knew in this dream it did that a few times and I was a little scared, but I wasn't terrified. And in the caboose -- in the real one there's a little compartment where you can put candy and stuff, but in my dream we put three chocolate bunnies in there, like about 3\" high, hollow ones, and we stuck them in there and they rode in there like passengers. And we were getting ready to go somewhere and I wanted to grab a chocolate bunny, and I reached down under the tree and I grabbed it, and somehow the thing turned on and started going backwards and making that sound.

I don't even remember what song it was, but I was all set to go, I had it in my hands and I was ready to go. And my father came home.  And he was going to come in the bedroom and read or something or do his taxes I think. And I was going, \"Ahhhhhhhhh,\" but I tried to stay calm and I said, \"Could you please go outside? I have to do something yet.\" And he went outside, yet he seemed to know all along what was going on.

Each of us had all of our stuff. This was like a little pit stop that we made after graduation, before we moved back to where we were going to move back to. So here we are in this place. I think it was, I think it was a three-story place. Well yeah, it was a three-story place, but the rooms were tiny. The second story was nothing; it was just bleah. And the third story looked like Grammy's attic. Man, I haven't thought about that place for a while. And the first story kind of looked like our place here in Winna Park. The second story was just an interim hallway thing. So each of us had all of our stuff. I had all of my furniture and all of my sound equipment and all kinds of stuff, and so did she. And we were packing everything up in a trailer and I was going back to -- I can't remember if I was going back to my home town or if I was going over to Winner Park here.

I was so like stunned and shocked and disappointed that I left these things there, these really important things. I called the place right back and I said, \"Did you find these things there?\" and they said, \"Yes, we did,\" and they were going to send them to me UPS. Well, they sent me this really big UPS box, but instead of those things that I had left, they sent me like tons of like soaps and candles and hair brushes and mirrors and all these things that I kind of had the notion that were mine, that I had also left there, that I didn't even know I left there. But I was really worried because I wasn't going to get those really important things back, I don't think. And then I woke up, and I was so, oh, I was so relieved."

I think somebody said something or did something and it just all came back to me. I dreamt that I was back at my high school taking PE with Mrs. Thomas again, and she was a real cool, relaxed, laid back kind of person. Well, both of them were -- Mr. Johnson was mean to everybody else but nice to me for some reason, maybe because I was nice to him from the start. I don't know. But I dreamt that I was back with Mrs. Thomas and there was a gate at the back of the tennis court leading to the track that was one of those crazy emergency exit doors with the stupid alarm things, except the alarm wasn't just at the door; it triggered the whole fire alarm system for the whole school. And there were two of these doors, one at each end of the tennis court. These things had sound things on the fence that were really loud, and the one was loud. It was, I think somebody said it was like 100 db, and the other one was like 130 db. And, let me think, so the school was going to have a fire drill. I think they had to do it like twice a month instead of just once a month like standard is for Pen______ County Schools, but they couldn't just do it once , they had to do it one time when they opened the one door and another time when they opened the other door, so they had to do it twice, one hour apart. And so instead of going to the panel in the office and making the alarm go off, they just opened that door, and Mrs. Thomas had to have us doing jumping jacks as we walked through that door to out to the track where we were supposed to stand until they gave us the all-clear.  We were supposed to either do jumping jacks or _______ lift things or twist or arm circles or some kind of aerobic exercise as we were marching out that door. And it was really tough because I'm an audio engineer and going right past all that loud business is not good. So Mrs. Thomas gave me two huge microphone pop filter-like type things, one to put on each side of my head, kind of to cover over my ears, but more like on top of my head, sort of like. And she said they would filter out most of the high frequencies as well as cut the volume considerably, because -- according to her in my dream -- the high frequencies pierced through the air the most and wrecked your hearing the fastest. And I think some of this came from the Rupert Meade (?) tape that we saw about a fundamental sound with harmonics, and I started thinking about that terrible, awful alarm in the my high school Building 3 and how it's got that kind of buzzy harmonic thing going on in it, and I think that might be where this came from. So I put these things on the sides of my head and they opened the door, and it really did cut down on the volume and I did jumping jacks out that door, just like everybody else did.

But I was already going for this degree while I was a magical aerospace engineer, and what that means is pretty much a fancy term for studying illusions and stuff. I was studying to be a magician, and I knew that was going to be like a nothing degree. And when my college has you seeking a degree from them, they give you this little pink plastic case with these red laminated cards in it telling people what you are. And I opened my pink case and I had three cards in it that said, \"Jasmine, Illusionary Aerospace Engineer.\" And I just thought that was so ridiculous, and I wanted to change my major and I wanted to know if that was possible. And so I was looking through the brochure for the number for Guidance. There were phone numbers for principals and teachers and all kinds of offices, but no phone number for Guidance or Admissions or General Information.

The scene that I can remember is that I was in the bathtub washing up my feet and stuff, and I was totally naked, and Jill wanted to use the bathtub when I was done. And I asked her, \"Do you want me to let the water out of the tub and put new water in for you, or do you want to wash in the same water as me?\" And she's like, \"Oh, Jasmine, nobody washes in any kind of water that anybody else washed in.\" So I figured, okay, so I let the water out and there were a whole bunch of people in the bathroom watching me. And I swished it down the drain with my feet, and my mother carried me, wrapped me in a towel, and she carried me right from the bathroom right out to her bike. And I was wrapped in a towel, and my father had his bike. And my mother rode me in the basket of her bike, just like we used to, and they said, \"We've got a surprise for you.\" And I'm like, \"Well, you can't take me anywhere if I'm not dressed.\" But we were riding down the street and we came to this place that was called Discovery Track. It really sounds familiar, but I'm not really sure if it's a real place or not. We got off the bike, and I was dragging some kind of a cart behind me for a minute, and we were walking along this narrow brick road thing, and everywhere we looked there were model classic cars. There was an old fire truck, a really old white pick-up truck, a couple of Corvettes, some black car with the booshy front, around in front, and there was a twin of our car, and there were two Cadillacs parked in a garage, and there was also like a, oh, I don't know, a spinning ride thing off in the corner. And I got the feeling that this whole thing was like an amusement park ride, where you would sit in one of these old cars and somebody else would drive it or it would drive itself kind of around and around and around this race track. And you'd get a little ride and you'd say, \"Oh whoopee, I rode in an old car,\" and then you'd get out.  Look, I had a feeling there was going to be something more to it for me because I was special, and so they were taking me off to see this little movie in a little garage-like type thing, and then I woke up."

I started taking all of these massive tapes -- I have like a whole box full of these tapes in my closet, and I started taking them one by one, recording them to Cool Edit Pro, editing a few \"ums\" here and there, giving it some more amplitude gain to just kick it in the butt, and then saving it as an mp3 file and meticulously, methodically giving it a very specific file name like the date plus something else. And so when I go to start this tape, I'm thinking to myself, \"Okay, what did I leave off on? What file name did I give my last one?\" Oh no, I'm not supposed to be doing that, I'm supposed to be saying what today's date is. Well anyway, that was a waste of tape. I had a dream last night that there was some kind of tiff going on with my mother and my father and my mother was going to take me to some place to kind of get out of the house, and she said it was a surprise. And we walked and we walked to this place that sort of looked like a pizzeria called Langman and Dingeys (?) that we used to go to a lot on 4th Street, but it's since closed. And we were having Coke and these little potato chicken nugget things, and we were going down the line getting them off this buffet. And then the scene shifted and I was leaving this pizzeria without my mother, and I crossed the street, I jay-walked like we do. And I went into this museum. I can't remember if I had a cane or not, but I don't think I did. And I was looking for something in particular in there, but I had a feeling there was going to be this class in there about some kind of history or something. And this boy -- probably about 16 or 17 -- I don't know his name, but he was real nice -- he was going to be a student in this class too, and he was asking me to sit in on this class. And I said, \"Yeah, sure, I will.\" And so he took my arm, he didn't give me his, but he sort of grabbed my upper arm like my mother does when she's crossing me across the street or something, and started leading me down this hallway. It was a white, it started off with carpet on the floor, but then it was white. And it was this little incline. It sort of went up and then it went down, and there were all these little offices to our left and to our right, and I was looking in windows and I saw these flat surfaces in there and I said, \"Are those mixing consoles or just office desks?\" And he said, \"There are both in there.\" And I was like, \"Wowee!\" And by this time an instructor, probably in his 40's and I think two other boys and three other girls, joined us and we were all going to this little room that was going to have this class. And we finally got there, and it's this small, stuffy little room with a table and a bunch of cleaning supplies and stuff next to it. It kind of reminded me of the room at my elementary school's library where Ms. Fletcher and I used to work with the CC TV and stuff when she would see me. And I was thinking back to the library room at my elementary school and how they had a fire extinguisher on the wall that I thought was really an alarm or something, and they had one of these weird exit doors, which this room in my dream did, except this room in my dream had a double door like my high school's Media Center did. And the instructor sat us down at the table and said, \"Okay, we need to do a fire alarm because it's in my curriculum and I have to do it once a month.\" Now why I keep having bad dreams about schools and fire drills is beyond me. I think that's like long past, that's like water under the bridge. I don't know why I keep having dreams about that, but anyway he just opened the door matter-of-factly. He opened both doors actually and put the stopper things down, and an alarm sounded, but only a few of them sounded, far off in the distance, you know how that goes? And so I was like, \"Okay, this is not too bad of a deal,\" and we all walked out and we all went to this bus lane thing, you know how we always do. And we came back in through the front door when it was all over, and we walked down a little hallway ramp thing all together, past the offices, into this little room thing. And he said, \"Sorry, folks, but I have to do it again.\"  And he said, he was saying that somebody had redone the wiring because apparently before one of the alarm boxes was very unreliable and it would just set off the alarm system if anybody just breathed wrong.  And he said that he wanted this history class to be an exciting and interesting thing, but some of the students were afraid and unwilling to go in this room because of that factor. And so he had them redo the wiring, and apparently we had to do this again to make sure that the wiring was kosher and all. So this time he opened both doors matter-of-factly again. Oh man, it was horrible. So we ran out of the room and we went to the middle of this bus lane like you have to do, then we went back in the front way and we were going into the room again, and we said, \"Okay, now we can sit down and have our little class.\" And then I woke up."

And Aunt Christine was telling my mother that Allen Toussaint was in a nursing home and some criminal had come in there and chopped off his head. And for whatever reason the people let the body sit there for a year in the nursing home. And whoever it was came back a year later to chop off his hand. And I don't remember what happened with all of that, but I remember seeing this little TV show about the whole ordeal and the criminal was prosecuted. And some -- I think Bruce Springstein or some band put together this tribute CD for him. They got all kinds of singers and all kinds of people and performers to get together and perform his songs, and they were playing this CD in the kitchen. And this dream Adam Torrence and Professor Longhair were the same person.  And so this was the great loss of that persona. I'm trying to think now, I know there was a whole ordeal going on before this.

I don't know why I was dreaming all this; it's just sort of funny. But let's see, Adam Torrence covered S________ and I heard that on 89.7 last week. And I went to sleep with a sore wrist, and the neighbor, Cassandra's best friend, Corie's daughter, Eddie hurt, I mean, Eddie hurt his hand a couple of days ago and it seemed like it was going to be really bad, but it wasn't. And that's all I can think. I don't know what I was thinking."

Lately I've been doing the same where my body's gearing up for the time change and so I've been waking up at 6:00, going pee, getting a drink of water and then usually I lay back down because I'm just barely navigating and I don't really want to get up when it's still dark. And so in that morning between 6:00 and 7:00 I had a brief dream that Jim and Janet Page were out of town, but where they were was at this Festival of Dolls, I think my mother was calling it. And I sort of had a vision as if I was there with them. And in my dream Jim and Janet plus Cassandra and Courtney and Corie and Eddie were all like one big happy family, which to me, in my eyes, they are. And it would be really nice if we would all know each other and be friends. But anyway, I had a vision like I was there at this thing of theirs and everywhere I went I was hearing bells going, \"Ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding, ding dong dong ding,\" kind of like that song we do and kind of like how it is. Oh gosh, I can't think how it goes, I think it's C, E, D, G, C, E, D, G -- you know how bells are. And so I was hearing bells and I was in this back yard that was bigger than ours, but looked about the same as ours. And it was dark out and there was a big swing, and I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun. And I was making the swing spin around and twist all around and swing, and just have fun. And Eddie was on another swing, and my mother said, \"Be careful, you're not wearing a bra. You don't want Eddie to see your boobs, do ya?\" And at this party I was like totally naked.  And I was swinging on the swing and having a lot of fun, and my boobs were bouncing all over, of course. And then I woke up. I can't remember anything more.  I know I had some other dreams, but they were kind of boring and I didn't remember them after that morning hour."

And they were all in our living room kind of sitting around and lazing around like they do. And I think my mother and my father were somewhere in the house. And I think they were all trying to get a surprise together for me because they were wanting me to go over to the pool and swim at the pool for a while and leave them be at home. And in my dream this pool was located kind of in the same place that Circle Lake is, so it was only a hop and a skip away. Somehow I crossed the street and everything. So I put on my bathing suit, head out the back door, walk down the alley and go over to the pool, and I swim at the pool. And I would come home early and I would do everything I could to be quiet. I would leave the pool gate very carefully, I would sort of walk slowly down the alley and into the back, but my father would always be working in the garage and he would always see me coming home. So I would come in the house and say hi to everybody and then go back to the pool. So I did that a couple of times, like three times. And the last time I came in, I was pretty sure I saw them wrapping something, or something like that, and then they were going to pile in the car and go somewhere. I'm not sure where; it couldn't have been a restaurant because we had food in the car that we were eating. I had my 7-eleven cup that spills if you just breathe on it the wrong way. I had some kind of food that I was trying to eat and trying not to let it spill. All the girls were in the back, my mother was next to me and Sam was driving, and my father wasn't around. Whoopee! And Sam was driving well, I mean we were just going on an adventure, having fun, and I woke up before we ever got where we were supposed to go."

I think it started out that Josie and two of her friends were in town and were staying in the room where Sheryl and Sandra used to sleep, and the twin beds were still there. And they had this whole thing of jewelry, this whole like store display plaque shelf type thing that was about three feet high with everything under the sun dangling off of it. And they said I could borrow anything I wanted while they were here, and it was at the foot of the bed on this trunk like Sandra had. And so I took off a bracelet that was silver with stars on it, and I went around the house cleaning up various things. And I think I was out in the front yard, and a UPS man came by to deliver something, and he said I was getting a Nord Electro for my birthday. And he took this tall, long box off of his truck, kind of wide, but coming up to my chest level, and it was so heavy, he helped me get it onto the porch. And I was thinking, \"Yahoo! My dream is finally coming true, finally getting something like this for my birthday.\" But then it started to get tall and skinny, and it started to kind of shrink, and the box had an open front so that I could look into the box and I could touch the thing. And it was this tall, skinny baby toy-like type thing. It was still bright red, but, I mean, it was nothing like a professional thing that a Nord Electro really is. And I was thinking, \"What?! You mean to tell me this is my present?\" And by that time it was small enough and light enough that I could pick it up and just put the whole thing behind the blue chair in the living room and just pretend that I'd never even seen it. And then the next little scene was brief and fleeting, but I dreamt that I was in Jim Page's living room and he had a class of maybe ten or twelve, maybe even fifteen other students and me. His living room was a little bigger to accommodate us, and his instruments were spread out a little more. And we were at tables that looked like cafeteria tables, and I was in the very back. Well anyway, I remember he was passing around little worksheets for us and going into detail about explaining theory and stuff, not necessarily having us do anything hands-on. And he was having to stop and get everybody back on track and kind of discipline the talkers and stuff, just like Mr. Hartley would have to do. And after a little bit of that, I woke up. I think that scene came from the fact, flipping through the Thompson's First Grade Book, I see little quizzes and things and little things that are geared toward keeping students on track, and I can see how the unimpassioned student would get bored real fast. But, of course, I see all that as a means to an end."

And what the thing of it was that part of your grade related to whether you went up to the cafeteria buffet and served other people along with yourself, or whether you just served yourself. And I was in the line and there were only like three people behind me, and there was this boy ahead of me. And they had this kind of yukky turkey and pork fiber that was supposed to be a sandwich, but really wasn't it. And he plopped some of that on my plate and I was thinking, \"I can't serve this to anybody else; there's not enough.\" And some of the ladies behind the counter were going to give me more, or put more out for the people, and there were like little containers of fruit and little containers of jello, and I really wanted one but I didn't have enough money. So I took my measly little pork dish up to the cash register and paid for it and the lady wrote on my receipt that I got a 50 because I didn't serve anybody else. And then somewhere alone in this dream I felt like the cafeteria had a subwoofer under the stage and that there was a sound system that they were going to play for us during lunch. And that in a few days the cafeteria was going to be closed for a few weeks so they could remodel and retweak the sound system in some way. And then I was back home upstairs in my bedroom, and I had the feeling that I was still really close to that cafeteria, like it was downstairs in our house, and I wanted to go get something more because I was still hungry in my dream.

But also I don't feel good because I was almost sure that yesterday was going to be my party, and, of course, they didn't have my party yesterday. And so I had two dreams last night. The first dream I have a faint recollection of being in the living room with my mother. Get this: there was still a Christmas tree in there, and there was a coffee table where we put it when we put the Christmas tree. And I was wrapping these dumb little presents for myself with my mother and this paper with roses on it and stuff. There was like a little cheap toy watch and some hair bows and things, and a CD or something that I was wrapping for myself. And my mother had a box about the size of a shoebox that she was wrapping up, that she didn't want me to see. And I felt like it was going to be something a little bit better, but I didn't think it was going to be all that great. And so then we were putting these presents like under the Christmas tree, and still in my dream I didn't know when my party was going to be. And I'm walking around the house doing other things, and I kept checking behind the blue chair to see if maybe there were extra presents back there. And I kept waiting and looking all around the living room for a long box, and I didn't see it and I didn't see it, and I was waiting for this long box to appear. And I was so sure that it would and it didn't. And then I woke up. It was like 5:00 in the morning. I think I went pee or something and then I went back to sleep. It was freezing cold. This is going to be the coldest birthday I've ever had. And I dreamt that I was riding the bike with my mother in the dark and I had no pants on. And we go into this restaurant, like a pizzeria. It looks like CC's Pizza, like we went to before my job interview. And we were walking around and I had no pants on and I was real self-conscious and there were all these girls all around. And then I realized that this was going to be strip joints and that people were going to think I was a prostitute because I had no pants on. And then I think we rode around town a little bit more. My mother had some other place she wanted to take me. Oh, I knew there was some more to this. I think there was this really strange book on the dining room table with a red cover. And it was about musical instruments. It wasn't about the art of being a slut or anything. But somehow I had the notion that it was this really weird book about instruments that sane people wouldn't want to read. And then I woke up."

But last night I had kind of a stupid dream, but I think it makes a little bit of sense. I dreamt that my mother and I were in the park, laying on a blanket, and it was kind of cloudy in the sky, but not really going to rain or anything. And she was having a look across the lake with my distance _______ to see somebody over there that was going to be water skiing. And get this: my distance _______ had this flat plastic boggling (?) figure of Goofy on it dangling from the lanyard thing on an extra string, and my mother said that that was supposed to indicate the reference point of where the ground level was. Now what that has to do with anything, I don't know. But I looked across the lake and I saw the water skier, and he water-skied by and I was thinking, \"Okay, so what?\" So a little while later Terri showed up. She brought with her a schedule for me because I was starting high school the next day, except it didn't look like the little sheet of paper that my high school used to give me every year. It was a full sheet of paper like I get from my tech school like I print out from their web site. And it was formatted just like they did. So I was going to go to my high school again. I only had to go to two or three classes a day, but I had to get up at like 6:00 in the morning to be at school by 7:00, and I was thinking to myself, \"Oh gosh, ______ are going to kill me; I hate doing this.\" And then the scene shifted and I was at an art show with my mother. And I was helping her pack stuff up. We were folding chairs and loading stuff in the truck. And Courtney and Haley were there. And then I woke up. Now, as you probably know, Haley just moved down here and she's enrolling in North East High, so that's probably where that came from. And, oh, let's see what else. My mother has an art show coming this Saturday, so I think that's where that came from. This is just rather dumb, I think."

And somewhere in this plot I was heading for another city the next day, and I was getting calls from Arlene Thurston and Laura from my bus, and people I used to know, Marilyn and Noelle and I think Sheryl. Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were there too again. And what a lot of this line I was thinking about how I am going the other city, but I have no clue what I'm going to do over there. I'm not going back to my tech school. I'm not even going to have a job in the audio industry. I'm going to leave Jim and Janet. I'm going to get up and move, but what am I going to do when I get over there? So I was letting that thought go through my mind, and, you know, the Super Bowl and all this starting and this and that, and then the audio was kind of low because I was on the phone. And in this VIP box we had a Christmas tree and a couple of little Christmas village things underneath it, I guess because it was that time of year, right after Christmas. And so my mother was talking a little about putting in the CD ______ and I said I would do it in a few minutes. And so, get this: in the back of the VIP box across the hall there was this gift shop with fancy bowls and fancy cups full of glitter that they were selling. Everybody's sound equipment was staged in there and wired up so that it could work. And I asked my mother to turn up the volume on our receiver because Evelyn Cassidy was starting to sing \"Imagine.\" And she went in the gift shop, but instead of turning up the volume, she changed the input selection. And then she was all confused and I said, \"________ they were the gift shop.\" Anyway, I came through the door of the gift shop and I asked my mother, \"Where is our receiver? I don't know where it is. If you show me where it is, I'll take care of it.\" So she does like she does when I'm trying to find something in the refrigerator. She leads me to the general area, she says, \"It's in the middle,\" and then she runs away. And I'm looking around this little area she pointed me to, there's lots of glittery bowls and cups that are plastic, there's somebody else's receiver, there's a bunch of t-shirts and stuff, but I can't find ours. And it's like that was very frustrating."

Last night I had a dream, a really, really weird dream, that I was back at my high school again, I was in the Little Theater, the small theater where Mrs. Dougherty and her chorus used to rehearse, and there was a big acoustic grand piano on stage with a dark finish. But it had this electrical switch wired to the wooden ledge above the keys, and the reason why this existed like this is so that the performer could sit on stage and warm up and get ready to perform, and then he wouldn't have to get up for anything. He could just flip this switch on the ledge there and the curtains would open and the lights would dim and he wouldn't have to move. And he could just address his audience. But the only thing was that something weird, something wasn't wired right with this wiring, and so instead of the curtains opening and the lights dimming, the fire alarm would go off. And so the theater is kind of empty when I'm in there and it's starting to fill up gradually and I'm waiting for this concert and I'm really getting excited about this concert that they're going to do. And I was with a girl, a friend named Mary Lou, and she was sitting a few rows back and I got to see her when she was a year younger than me. I was still in high school, I guess, in this dream. And then I heard the people in neighboring seats chattering to me about how this wiring might not be so great anyway, and so it's time for him to perform, it's time for the pianist to come out and perform. And I'm like so afraid because of this, because I think the alarm is going to sound when he wants to dim the lights or something. And so, sure enough, that's what happened, but I didn't hear any alarm sounds in the Little Theater. It was like outside, outside in the hallways. But I'm so afraid that I'm yelling for Mary Lou to come. And I got up and I ran down the aisle and Mary Lou ran after me and we ran outside before the rest of the school alarms went off. Now I wonder where in the world all of this is coming from. I think the part about being back at my high school and stuff is the fact that I've been going through and putting all of my other dreams into mp3 files and Audio Audition, and, you know, I've been hearing my voice evolve sort of, and, you know, I've had lots of dreams about my high school and fire drills and stuff, and I think that might just be coming back to me. And, of course, Jim had me practice on his big acoustic one yesterday, so I had that exposure. But I can't help thinking there's a little more to do this, and it's sad. But that's the gist of it."

Everybody spoke English, but there were a lot of ethnic accents. And they were going to have this big banquet and the end goal of the whole dream was to get to the big banquet and meet up with my mother and Cassandra. So I went to the registration desk and I showed them my ID, and they said, \"Who did you come with?\" and I said, \"Evelyn.\" And they looked in their data base and they said, \"Oh yes, we have you.\" And they gave me four choices of ______ to pay _____: fifty, twenty-five, fifteen or ten. So, of course, I paid the $10 because I didn't know what it was for. And then I went down this little hall, thinking I might find the banquet hall. And there was this room. By this time I met up with this lady who was helping kind of guide me along, and she was big and fat and a little rough, but she was kind and she sort of grabbed me by the arm and we were like walking around. She told me there was this private party going on in that room and I could hear an Irish jig going on. And then we went up a little couple of stairs and through a back hallway and go to this banquet hall that looked more like a restaurant. It had square wooden tables and we were sitting in wooden chairs. And there were no table cloths or anything on these tables, and my mother and Cassandra were sitting at a regular table, and they put Courtney and me at a little kids' table across the way. And it turns out that my mother and Cassandra and Courtney and everybody were getting fish fillets and vegetables, and all I got was a little piece of bread and half a cup of Shirley Temple in a Styrofoam cup. And I had only paid $10 to register, I was a junior member. And so then I woke up."

They were totally black on top and their legs and their stomachs and their faces were tan. And they were growling at me. And one came real close to taking a big bite out of my chin. And the guy said that -- I can't remember what we did to calm him down, but the guy said that there was a trick to it, that I think they didn't mean any harm, but they were just hungry or something dumb like that. But I think the one actually did bite me after a while, and I was running away, trying to get away from him, and I ran down the alley into our back yard and Eloise showed up. And apparently she needed something too. She needed a new collar or something, and I got the feeling like she was thirsty. And she came up and just laid on my shoulder and kind of licked me, like she does to Cassandra. And I thought that was sweet, and I held her and petted her, and then I sort of woke up.

And so Jill had somebody else that was with her that was rooming with her.  Well, we were out in the bus circle at Bancroft, but the inside looked like my high school. And Jill knocked me down on the ground and took off my clothes, so I was running around buck naked. And I was wearing a really pretty orange dress, and Jill just knocked me down and took it off off me. And she put it on. And she was walking around school in this orange dress that was mine, and I was walking around naked.  And we were doing into this auditorium, I thought, and I had the feeling like it was okay to go to class naked, but it wasn't going to be okay to go to this party naked that we were going to go to. And so we're sitting in this auditorium waiting for this concert or play to begin, and we're right in the front row.

I can't remember what she was singing, but I know she was singing something that I didn't know. I had the feeling like she might have sung two or three songs that I almost knew and then some that I just didn't.

But one of the scenes I do remember was that my mother and I were at the South Bend Park, the place where you go before you come to the beach. And she was riding her bike and I was walking, and I had the feeling like we were coming home from the pier, because we had just been there. And I was ahead of her, and she was riding her bike trying to catch up to me. And I decided I was going to walk back to her on the bike, I mean walk back to her and her bike, and so that I could walk alongside her and talk and stuff like that. So I'm going back to her and all of a sudden a couple of sprinklers turn on and they're spraying right at the sidewalk like the ones at my tech school used to do. And I decided, \"Whoops -- I don't think I could go that way.\" And I was really afraid of these sprinklers in my dream. And so I turned around and kept going my own way, and I was going along my own way and going along and saying, \"Okay, she's just going to have to go through the sprinklers and get wet.\" And so I'm a ways down the road, and then all of a sudden all the sprinklers turn on and they're all spraying right at the sidewalk and they're in the grass too. There's more in the grass spraying all over the grass. So it's sprinkle city as far as I can see, and this park as far as I can see, which probably isn't that far. But anyway, I'm standing there surrounded by sprinklers, getting soaking wet, and yelling for help, except I can't really yell. You know how it is in a dream. And then I find a little place where there's an intersection of a sidewalk where I can stand right in the middle of the intersection and not get too wet, but I'm still surrounded by all these sprinklers and I'm scared to death for whatever reason it is. And eventually my mother comes on the bike and her big back basket is as big as her front basket, and she puts me in her back basket and rides off, and I'm not getting wet any more once I'm on the bike, and I'm not even really afraid of the sprinklers any more. And then I faded into some other stupid thing. I thought this was just something dumb that occurred in my mind, but when I told my mother about it, she said that the sprinklers represent the circumstances of my life right now, I think, because I feel like I'm being surrounded and sort of led astray to some degree by going back to school, and I'm being kind of wrestled down and -- what should I say? -- closed in and trapped by all of that stuff. And I kind of tend to agree, I think. And, you know, she always tries to rescue me from bad emotional situations. So I guess that's what that is."
