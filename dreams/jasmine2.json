They've been slipping away from me as soon as I gain consciousness for some reason. But the other night I had a dream that I was at this run-down house -- kind of like Aunt Margaret's house -- and we heard this band playing. And Catherine and I were walking around, and we were going to try to record this thing, and it was playing in one of those portable classroom-like things. And we were walking around to get the best vantage point because she wanted to record it. And we even stepped inside and realized that it was much quieter in there, because their amplifier was, they had the wires like under the door and everything outside so that we could hear them. And it looked just like my mother's vacuum cleaner, only without the hose.  And then I was listening to a tape that was supposed to have some oldies on it, but instead it had some Blue Bird songs and some oldies. And I dreamt that Catherine and I -- it was dark by then -- we were walking and she gave me three numbers. One was 877-5432, the usual one. The other one was one that she had gotten for her birthday, but she got it taken away because she violated her curfew. And then the third one was another one that she got."

It looked just like my mother's vacuum cleaner without the hose. And last night's dream was full of red things. I don't remember, I have no recollection as to what happened, but I remember walking in a red house and seeing red things, and having a little toy house that was red. I don't remember anything else.

First I dreamt that Josie and Marilyn and my father and I were staying in a hotel, and I confronted my father about canceling the Gordon House in the spring, and he actually felt bad about it. And he took us to this -- right when I confronted him, he was wearing this robe like judges wear -- and then we went to this park called Hamilton Inn Park. And it was out towards Rio Villa, or Josie said it looked like we were going to Rio Villa. And when we got there, we didn't have to pay or anything; we just walked in. And we went up these stairs. Everything was in water up to our ankles. We were walking up this path and went up these stairs, and then we got in this pool and started swimming, and there were jets and vents, but I wasn't terribly concerned. And we walked, or we swam -- I swam right behind my father, who whistled once in a while to help me echo locate him , and we pulled into this part of the pool that was under an overhang, and it got closer and closer and closer. The sides got closer and closer together until I had to get out and just crawl on the side. I couldn't swim any more, they were so close together. And then I realized that in this echoing overhang they were playing a tape of scary sounds and I mixed it, without a mixer . How can you mix without a mixer? But anyway, after that I was just glad I could get down out of there, and my mother was saying she had to clean that pool area pretty soon. And then I woke up."

He says that the CD burner is a p__peeing(?) unit because it's going and recording in the same way that we go pee. I woke up at 1:30 in the morning and I was kind of scared, but I had to go pee.

And I was, before I opened the box I was wondering where could the audio module be, because in Ariel it's in her fin. And when I opened the box, I saw that she was just like a regular Barbie Doll on top, but she had, she had like a thing without a tail. She had no legs. And apparently that was the sound thing for her. And then, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park. Anyway, I saw Celine Dion rehearsing in the park, and she was singing louder than anything without a microphone.. This pen is driving me insane. She was singing as loud as she could without an amplifier, and it was just like that she had one. And then I walked in to her hotel room and I saw her and her kids kind of peeking around in there. And I got to see the outfit that she was going to wear to the concert, and I got to talk to her, and her voice was quiet, just like Sandra's voice. And I'm afraid this thing's going to eat my tape; it sounds awful. [tape player making a lot of noise.] But anyway, I dreamt that me and Elizabeth's family ran into her family and just talked.

I dreamt that we were all this party, and my father and my mother and I were holding hands with a bunch of other people in their 40s, and we were all kind of marching around the trampoline and singing a variation of one of the songs that we normally wouldn't even sing to. The real song goes, \"Sally go round the sun, Sally go round the moon, Sally go round the chimney top every afternoon, boom!\" And the rendition, the variation in my dream goes, \"Cindy around the chimney, Susie around the sun, Cindy around the chimney, and then the work is done.\" I can't explain that. Then last night I had a dream that I was walking down this long hall with my mother and we were like at Tyme Gardens or something, and it was this exit place for handicapped people. And it was a long hall. And we finally get to where they open the doors, and we were supposed to ride on this little coup car thing, but we couldn't because there was a storm coming. And then person who was supposedly a jet ski rental person came over, and my mother told her about the storm. And then suddenly we were at school and I was showing my mother things before we left for the last day. And it ended like a week ago. And I was afraid that I didn't go and take one of my exams because I could only exempt three exams, and I only took two exams. But then I realized that Media was one of the exams and it wasn't even like taking one. So then I was showing my mother the elevator, and she didn't have a key, but she could put $5 in it and go down to the first floor. And then we were sitting on a bench with this administrator lady and she said that everybody's key is - oh, what's the word? They have this thing in there where you can only go to certain places at certain times, and I said, \"I have never noticed that,\" and she said, \"That's because you're never sick.\""

And we were standing on balcony at the mall and he knocked them over the banister and they all went falling and crashing down to the first floor. And, I don't know, all of a sudden they had this CD writer on a picnic table, and he said that he went back and he got another one, and he was saying that this nun named Angelina wrapped the CD's. And then I was, he had to take the sound equipment and put it in a box for some reason, and then he gave me the box and told me that I had to put it all back together. And I took the equipment out and set it back on my desk like it goes, and I was started to put the wires back in and they were all going in pretty good, and then the wires for the speakers on the west wall weren't going in so good and I needed help putting them in. And my father was on the phone, so I needed help putting them in. And I woke up before the wires could be connected again."

And he said that that was going to be storing it until next year. And as soon as he left, I would take it out and put it back on the desk. And I had to return a book to the librarian, but I was too afraid to go up to her, and I don't think I ever returned it before I woke up. Last night I had a very peculiar dream. First of all I dreamt that we were near a sea wall at the waterfront, and everybody wanted me to scuba dive. They said that if I wanted to stay down there for three weeks, I was going to need scuba gear . And also I dreamt that Sir Galahad was this paper Styrofoam bird with paper wings and a napkin folded and all for her tail. And she was really a listening device so that I could monitor what people were saying on the phone. And there was also these two other birds, Archie, my cocJanicel and then there was this white bird -- very delicate with a plume -- and wings that were raised up. And then both of those birds were kind of in cahoots with the Styrofoam Sir Galahad somehow, and the wings of the other white bird also stayed up for some reason. Then I also dreamt that I was sitting on the steps with my feet towards the up of the steps, and I was trying to get the mini-cassette to work, and the terminals were like way loose, and it wasn't really cooperating. There was this big cardboard box ____??_______. And then my father comes up the steps. Anyway, this tape is really squeaky now. And then my father comes up the stairs and says that it's my problem. And then I woke up."

The first one, I dreamt that I was back at Bancroft, kind of, and I was in a stairwell, and there must've been ten alarm boxes all on the same wall. And some administrator was saying that when the alarm goes off, these doors locked, and then you were stuck in there for the next half an hour. People would tell me that the doors close to prevent the fire from spreading, but I was afraid they'd lock, too. I also dreamt that I got caught shoplifting that time, and I dreamt that I had stuffed some pens and scissors in my socks and walked out, and one white person and two black people were not going to let me pass. And I dreamt that a police officer came and put me in handcuffs and then I woke up. Never experienced this for real, not sure why I'd dream it. The next one I don't even remember."

We were walking around these gardens and things and it was all supposedly a city of Salamanca, but there were no real buildings besides her house. And hmmm, I don't remember anything else now, but I remember that I was so shocked that this big, fat woman could hardly speak any Spanish and she lived in Spain."

I didn't have space to write them down and certainly couldn't record them while I was over there. So I had a lot of interesting, fascinating, probably meaningful dreams that got lost. Okay, the first one: I dreamt that my mother and I wanted to take a walk, and we were going to bring the personal CD player along with the hand-held portable radio in order to listen to what the boats were doing out in the water. We were going to walk down to the waterfront. And we started walking and I got lost, and I just sat down and listened to the personal CD player. But when I was listening to it, the sound stung for some reason. And then we were riding around in somebody's Fox 13 truck and it had a siren on it. And I had to stay like five feet away until they deactivated it. Another one that I had was that we were looking in Service Merchandise for a cell phone, and the cell phone that was supposed to be, it could, it was like a FM receiver or a hand-held thing. It really wasn't a phone at all. It had three little knobs on it, it had a little display and an internal speaker. The sound was really thin and flat, though, but for some reason we were all fascinated by it. The next thing I know, we were walking In the park with this thing clipped to my belt. Well, I can't remember any others."

Anyway, we were talking about going to this little school at night, and afterwards going to this theme park. And then we were at the school and Aretha Franklin and this other lady named Elizabeth were going to show us how to cook something, and then they started showing us how to cook it. And everybody was like zoning off and wanting to go to sleep and wanting to not pay attention, but then I remember going on a roller coaster that everybody was talking about, and you held onto some orange handles. And you would go down for a long ways and you'd go upside down and around and all over. And we never did get to the theme park. I woke up first."

And then somehow I ended up at the Homecoming dance and I was on the second floor of the main buildings looking out into the courtyard with Ms. Ross and Ms. Simpson, and we were talking about an overhead projector that was rolling through the courtyard to somebody's classroom. And then I told them I had to go down and go to the dance. And I was at the dance and it was hot in the bright sun in the middle of the day in the courtyard, and there was a girl named Janice that was sitting at the sound board and her and I were talking. I had a dream that I was on a ship, of all things, and that we were going up and down and up and down long, narrow staircases with a bunch of my friends. And I was seeing alarm boxes everywhere, like fire alarm boxes. And I would get all nervous and jerky when I would see one. Continued on Side 2."

This room was really neat.  So I walked out with them and I walked around, and we got on this elevator that was absolutely bizarre, and the elevator would like go sideways for a long ways, and then slowly get down to a floor or two and then go sideways some more, and then get down a floor or two, and then go sideways some more.  And so on and so forth.  And then we got off and I was walking around again.  Anyway, I was walking around with them, and I was going to go back to the room with them, but instead of going back to the hotel room, I went to the room with the wedding cake and stuff and was touching the pretend wedding cake.

So I crawled under it and it was like a trampoline thing, and when I went in it, it was kind of low to the ground, and I wondered how am I going to get out of here. But when I realized what they were going to do, I was scared, and I thought to myself, \"I've got to get out of here somehow.\" And then I asked my father, who was up above, I asked, \"Can I walk and down the walk while you guys do this?\" And he said, \"Sure.\" So I wormed and squirmed my way out from under the truck. There was just enough room for me to squirm out from under it. And I realized that they were going to start up the engine and back it up a little bit, and then move it forward, so the result would be I would hear the back-up alarm and then hear the siren. So I figured I would walk as far away as I could and then be far way when that happened. So I took my bag -- I don't remember what I had in it at this time, but it will come to me, I'm sure. I took my bag and I went walking, and I walked, actually then I realized that the truck was parked in front of our house and I walked all the way up to 8th Street. And then I turned down 8th Street and went to 23rd Avenue and like went around a few blocks, and then I came back and they hadn't done it yet. And then I figured, \"I gotta get out of here somehow.\" So I started crawling over all these boxes that suddenly appeared, and I started crawling faster and faster and faster as my father started -- I couldn't see him, but somehow I know that he was getting in the driver's seat and getting ready to start it up. And I crawled faster and faster and faster, and all of a sudden it started becoming dark and I faded into consciousness. One other important thing about this dream that I remember is that somewhere after that I had another little dream about the digital recorder that we were using, that it was part of the truck, and that I was worried that maybe the back-up alarm or something was integrated into it because it had like the click on the side of it that went \"drive, park, reverse\" and I was deathly afraid of putting it in reverse. But I did, I asked him and he said that wasn't the case, but they did, the gas fuel alarm thing on it. That was strange. But in real life it didn't have any of that on the side. In real life it was just hunky dory, but it had bad sound."

Yech!\" And then I said something, I yelled something and then I slammed the door behind me and I ran out with my mother to go to the Thai restaurant with the firemen people. I think this dream was brought on be a subconscious overreaction to his teasing last night about I didn't use his binder and so he was teasing about he's just an old bird these days. Now I remember something else about that dream. After my mother and I walked out, we went to Circuit City and I think she was tell me she dropped something, and she was going to have to pay for it. I don't remember exactly."

And we looked around and we bought something that was like a DVD player, and some other boxes looked at it and then we decided we were going to buy it. So anyway, we bought it, and we got home and immediately when we brought it home, it was a VCR, and I took it out of the box and hooked it up to the amplifier as if I'd done it a hundred times, like I do with the the board. Then I took the closest video tape that I could find and put it in there to check it out, but I didn't even turn on the TV because all I was interested in was the audio. That was weird! And then my father was coming in and I turned everything off so that he could turn it on and pretend that he was the first one to turn it on.

So we just started out the door and we started driving, and all of a sudden my father appeared in the passenger seat. Now I remember. We were driving to the cabin, and we got to the cabin and my father stressed the importance of being quiet and stuff. And some force made me turn on the sound equipment, it happened to be in a room in the cavern that looks just like my workroom, and I couldn't turn it off. I clicked the power switch off, but the sound was still blasting at full level. So then I had to stop the CD player and try and turn it off. Last night I had a funny dream. First of all I dreamt that I was in the Devil Vision room with Elizabeth and we were going to take a test in there for some reason. And we were coming out and the librarian sees us coming out and she comes to talk to us. And Elizabeth is teasing and she says \"Yeah, that's Jasmine, messing up your room in there.\" And then we go out a back door and we're in this field thing, and then I'm with my mother, and I was trying to find a place to practice my song for chorus and not have anybody listening. I'm tired; can you tell? [sigh] There were these kids around and so I can't. I stand up on this tall thing and I start singing, and then all of a sudden I'm in this church and I'm auditioning in front of Mrs. Dougherty and Mr. Hartley. And they give me a song that's completely out of my range and I keep screwing up and stuff.

Later we walked out to the football field and it was real cold and there were several little fires going. And there was one that was almost burned down, and I put my hand in the embers to get a little statue of a parrot out of there, and it didn't burn me at all, it only tingled a little bit so I figured I'd better get away from here before the teacher sees me sticking my hand in the fire. And then, after I pulled the statue of the parrot out, it started burning big again, and Mrs. Hollander and Mrs. Dougherty and I sat down on the bench in front of it to keep us warm, because it was cold.

And they wanted everybody to sit down and turn a certain way, but we were all in the aisle. And we started singing, \"Deck the halls with boughs of holly, fa la la la la la la la la.\" And then we started going faster and faster, and I thought to myself how the words were tripping over each other, and how it got to be tongue twister when we started going faster and faster. And we got to, \"Fa la la, la la la, la la la,\" I had to go into my own octave, and that happened to be when Mrs. Dougherty was standing right next to me. And I kind of went up a little bit too high, I think. And then suddenly her and I were walking in the park together, like my mother and I do, and she started running and I held onto her one arm with both of my hands and we ran together. She said, \"This is good exercise.\" And then she, with her other arm, puts her other around me and starts spinning us around and around and around, and then we start just walking again and she yells something, something like, \"Didn't That feel good?\" and I say, \"Easy, won't that hurt your voice?\" And she didn't answer. So we kept walking and before we knew it, we were home. And I told her I had to, it happened to be when my mother and my father were home, and I told her I had to vacuum up some bird seed on the porch. And she said, \"Well, let me run home and get my car, and I'll vacuum for you.\" And I said, \"No, you don't have to.\" And she said she would vacuum for me. And then I got home and my mother was there, and then I called her and left a message that my mother was already here. I don't remember what happened after that."

And I was sitting down to make it, and it was like 9:30 at night, and I figured I'd better hurry just in case. And so I called what I thought was the, it was called the radio phone line for some reason, and it led into the Drama and Band Department. And Mr. Vincent answered, and I was really a befuddled buffoon as to what to say. I thought at least Mr. Hartley would answer. And then I woke up."

My father bought me this mixer thing, meaning a cake mixer, not a sound mixer. And it was this round ball thing with a handle on it that you would mix around in this big vat container, and this motor would run and make a vat container for some reason. And he brought me this set of stuff because he thought I would like to mix up concoctions and things. And, oh yeah, I was standing at the kitchen counter mixing some chocolate batter and all the food was on top and all the bits of chocolate were on the bottom, and I tipped the container over when I was mixing it, and the motor was running underneath the container, I guess keeping it warm or something. And I dropped the mixer ball and it somehow goes down the drain and the motor starts doing funny things. And I told my father and he called the company, hoping they can come out here and take it out, but there was still another mixer ball, but it wouldn't work if the other one was stuck in the drain.  That was bizarre."

I dreamt that we were coming home in Elizabeth's Mustang, her and I, and I was sitting in the back with my book bag because on the bus I sit right behind the driver, so I sat with my book bag in the back. And I don't remember her having the sound system or anything on, but she said she wanted me to sit in the back because I was so heavy. I don't remember; I'm sure there was more to it, but I can't remember.  And oh yeah, this time change is wonderful. I usually get up at 5:30 every morning for school.

And when it goes forward, it doesn't do anything, but when it goes backwards, it makes the back-up alarm sound. And there were these ambulances things and stuff that would ride around the perimeter, and then Mrs. Dougherty was busy running around doing things. But then we were in our kitchen and my father was questioning Mrs. Dougherty about the way she teaches, and she's defending herself. And my mother says, \"Why does it matter, who cares?\" And he said, \"Well, even better if people are trying to contribute,\" and he goes in the bedroom, and her grade book happens to be sitting on the bed in the bedroom. And he looks through her grade book and he sees that she does actually have an orderly way of keeping things. And there's these CD's, these really flimsy CD's that are bigger than normal CD's that are running there and then we go around and we do different things, and we were talking about going to this restaurant, and then it's dark and we're on our porch and Mrs. Dougherty suddenly appears there, and she was talking about how she was thinking of doing this certain song.

But then I just said, I made up a story that I needed a book about growing plants, and so she took me into the devil vision room and she was looking on the computer for something, the card catalog in the computer. And the librarian was over working with the other people, but, and then I was eating my lunch and she handed me the book, and I said, \"Thank you,\" and she said, \"We'll have to make a lunch date some time.\" And then I was going back to class because the bell had rung, and I had to go across the street over to the Birch Building, and then down and around to the main building. And I never did get to class before I started having another dream. I dreamt that we were at the, we were going to ride our bikes to the mall, and we did and we got there, and I was running along behind my mother and my father with this pillow. And we decided we didn't want to take the pillow in with us, in the mall, so I ran back to the bike, tossed it in the dumpster and then ran back to my mother and my father. And then I woke up."

And I remember telling Ms. Hammond that I have a mandatory chorus rehearsal to go to, and she let me out, \"no problemo.\" Then I went and I came into the auditorium and I sat down with four other people who were kind of in the auditorium; we were up in the balcony. And Mrs. Dougherty was kind of pacing around and talking to us, like she does, and kind of instructing the other people as to how they were supposed to stand and all when we went on stage, and then all of a sudden, in poured the class and they were noisier than anything. And they were just real loud and ruckussy in their sound filled the auditorium, and trying to get everybody quieted down, I don't remember exactly how. But we were supposed to be taking pictures for the yearbook, I guess, and everybody had to be in long pants and some kind of a shirt, which really didn't make a whole lot of sense, but that's how it was in my dream. And then Mrs. Dougherty was explaining how some of the boys were so fat that they couldn't even sit down in their chairs. And then I woke up and it was like 6:00. Then I went back to sleep and I had another dream. I dreamt, first of all, that I was in my bedroom and that it was daylight. And I had this bathtub full of Christmas decorations, which that's the place I was storing my presents for Christmas. But I was taking the bears out and putting them around, and this one bear I hung on the door, and it was this snoring musical bear where it had a three-way switch to just snore or just snore and play music too. And the other thing was this reindeer. It was just like the mechanical one that I used to have, only the mechanical one doesn't run any more. But in my dream the mechanical part didn't run, but for some reason it was playing 94.9 and it was sound, and that just made me go bananas in my dream.  I closed my door, I closed both of my doors so they latched in my dream, and [whispering] I kind of perched on the bed and then it was the bathtub that I perched on. It was so wild that I was kicking my legs around and stuff, and I was holding onto the railing. [regular voice again] Oh, that was another one of those embarrassing dreams. I hope nobody ever listens to this tape. And then when that wild episode was over, I came back into the bedroom from being in the bathtub, I came back into the bedroom, and there I found my mother on my bed snoring away, and I wondered how she got in there and what she saw. And then I woke up."

And I went over to her and I talked to her, and she was this really high soprano that could hit this high B-flat, and she couldn't understand why I couldn't. And so I told her that, I told her to tell my mother and my father to meet at the big Christmas tree at 7:00 o'clock. And then she kind of led us on this tour thing, and we went into this other foyer that had carpeting and there were like boxes and stuff all piled all over everywhere. And she watched me go into this other little room where I had to climb over boxes to get to her, and there was like a broadcast booth and I sat there in the back. And it turned out that this is Elizabeth's car and it's not a transmitter, but a receiver in there.  And Elizabeth's car drives away and drives back home.  And my father says, \"She was sitting over there till we got there.\" Then I had this subordinate dream that my watch said 7:48 in the morning when I was supposed to have been out the door at 7:00, and Bobby's clock said 2:00 in the morning, and I couldn't read the time on mine. And I went clear to the microwave and the microwave said 2:00 in the morning. That was weird; I didn't know exactly what time it was."

I don't why, probably because I was, or I used to be, well, I used to be. I dreamt that I was at the radio station for my first day my title would be \"teletist\" -- and it looks a lot like my bedroom, and I was sitting down talking to either Kira or Rose or somebody, and then I realized I was naked. And so I closed myself in my closet and I got some clothes on and then I came out and started doing some things. And they had this large buffet set up or chicken and bacon and beans and salad, and these big, gigantic cookies. And I took a bite of one of these cookies and then I woke up."

And then I realized that there were two of them; there was one in its normal position and one that was sitting on my chair. And I was supposed to put it on top of the tape player, which is to my right when I'm sitting at my desk, and the amplifier and CD burner are to my left. And I was supposed to put the second CD burner on top of this tape player, and there was also this extra external CD player that would feed stuff into the mixer for me that I had to, and so I was stacking up all these units and then I turned the light off and I sit down and I turn on my amplifier, and the amplifier is just this massive, this massive receiver like I see in Sound Invision (?) and it's got this fluorescent display that these wild colors that change color with the tone that I hear. And it had a tape deck built right into it. I was like, \"Wow!\" And I exploring all these different functions, and I was listening to a Kenny Rogers tape in it and it sounded pretty good. It didn't sound as good as my other tape player though for some odd reason. And if I was listening to this tape and watching the display fluorescently change and the indicators flash, I slowly faded into consciousness and my radio came on and startled me awake.

And as we were taking down the Peavey system and putting it away, it was getting really dark and we built a campfire. And I dreamt that my father told me he planned to bring me there for my birthday, and he said, \"I've been checking out your equipment\" and I was like, \"Why?\" And, \"Well, I want you to have a nice evening,\" which I can imagine what that would mean. And I said, \"Well, I would sure like to have the Peavey system along for my birthday thing.\" And, let me see, I think there was something else. Oh, then we were in the car on the way home and we were coming around the alley, we were going to pull in the back."

We brought them home, and I was like typing up a storm because it was Sunday night and my essay was due on Monday. And I also had my vocabulary to do, and I was thinking maybe I could handwrite it, but I wouldn't get very far. And so typing up a storm and also something happened to the computer, and it gets this weird thing going on, like it shows the keyboard on the screen like highlight the letters as you type them. And in order to get rid of this, we have to like do a whole bunch of \"escape\" and all this stuff, and I haven't even saved my work to a floppy. And then I wake up with a start and I realize that the whole time I was typing I wasn't writing my essay, I was describing and writing about the system, the system from my EJ thing that's called the Escort 2000.

And I was supposed to go to the doctor and get this shot to take it away, but instead they gave me a pill and it was a pill, it was like an olive and had been soaked in juice. All the olive juice went down my throat with the water and kind of made my mouth numb. But the olive wouldn't go down. I asked her to cut it in half. She was looking around, she didn't have a knife, so we had to take it home and cut it in half. And in the second part of the dream we were walking with Grammy to -- I don't know -- just around the neighborhood, and we stopped at this church that had a fountain and everything and I wanted to explore while they walked through. Well, I went around the back and I climbed up the back steps and I perched on this little ledge and grabbed onto the window and I could see the sound board and stuff.

And then descended the stairwell, which was totally in the dark for some reason. And then I was in the living room decorating this fan, you know like the fan we have in the living room that is portable? Well, I was decorating it with like these sequins that were supposed to represent MP3 files in some way. And there were light bulbs inside the fan that lit up, and my mother was suggesting to me that there were light bulb sockets on the outside and that I should take them off and put them on the outside. And then there was this light-up frog. I couldn't tell if it was a frog or an owl, and my mother was talking to me about somebody who gave it to me, and I was holding it like from the bottom, and this fan-thing inside of it like turned on and made a wind.

I was putting like Evelyn 's Mo Jo with the Concert 90 and the blue and white one with Mariah Carey or something and two other Mariah Careys together and so on and so forth, thinking that maybe I was going to organize them better.

I dreamt that I had been practicing on the keyboard and I had it plugged in with an AC adapter to the extension cord under my dresser, and it was set up on top of its box on the bed so that I could stand up straight and sing, but still be able to see the keys like I did that one time when they were at the movies. And all the lights were off in the bedroom and I was talking to my mother in her work room. And I go in the bedroom and I turn the lights on, but for some reason, me turning on the lights powers up that extension cord underneath my dresser -- it doesn't really, but it did in my dream. And having power at that AC adapter powered up the keyboard, even though I didn't turn it on. And that familiar robot voice that greet us and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, you mean to tell me I didn't put it away?\" And so, and then it said, \"Select a song.\" And then it starts playing this song because, see, in real life it can do this song demonstration thing, and when you activate it, it says, \"Select a song.\" So we did that, but it started playing this song to demonstrate, but it was like a Celine Dion song from 94.1. That was kind of cool. And then my mother wanted me to teach her how to do some things and teach her about the notes of the staff and all, so I turn it off for a minute and I go to my desk and I draw a five-line staff and I start labeling the lines and spaces on scrap paper. And I'm ready to go back and give it to my mother and start teaching her, and next thing I know, she's back in her room sorting her papers and I missed my chance to teach her and show her.

I dreamt that I was walking around with an IFB box clipped to my belt, and I had a set of headphones on, and I had two microphones, one in each hand. One was a lavalier clip one and one was like a wired heavier one. And I was talking to people and people were talking to me. And the level in my ears was like really loud, and I was trying to figure out how to turn it down so I wouldn't feel so nervous. And instead of turning it down, I turned it up and it was even louder, and I just couldn't control it after that.  And I was like walking around the back yard with this stuff and stuff. And then I dreamt that I was going to create a mermaid poster show, like a mermaid audio show with topic figures, and I was going to use all my voice except Flounder was going to be a kind of my voice at a faster speed. My voice in real time was going to be Ariel, my voice slowed down a little bit was going to be Sebastian, and my voice slowed way down was going to be Triton. And I was going to like make these figures on a cardboard and make them go around the stage and play this strange audio. And I was thinking how I was going to write all the music and stuff for it and everything. And I got to drawing the figures, and then I just kind of woke up. Now maybe that's a really good idea. I should do that for real now, shouldn't I?"

First I dreamt that my father was doing some kind of remodeling up here, and I not only had a fan with black blades, but I had this air conditioner that was mounted in the ceiling and I was going to control it on the wall with the fan switches. And so I remember I didn't know how to shut off the air conditioner and I was ice cold, and I was going to tell my mother to come shut it off. And I dreamt that in my mother's room, she had this rack CD player that was like a box machine that goes with system stuff. And it was kind of silvery and it had a little design in the front. And I was trying to figure how she worked it and stuff. And it wasn't connected to any amplifiers or anything, so I don't know how she got sound out of it, but I remember it was pretty, kind of neat, and I was thinking, oh, she could finally play CD's and maybe she'll start getting rid of her tapes. And then I dreamt that my mother had a tape of the X Files that I made a CD of so she was getting rid of that tape, and I was thinking of saving it so I could recycle it, but I said naaah. Next I had another little dream, after I figured, I dreamt that I was so ice cold in my dream because the fan was making me cold, so I got up and turned it off. And I went back to sleep and dreamt I was at this fair thing with my mother, and there were these kids over in this one booth that she was watching while their mother went to go do something, and while we were in the bathroom, my mother told me she knew some stuff about Celine Dion, like her address and her phone number, but didn't want to tell any of us, and I guess because I knew who her baby doctor was, because she blabbed it all over TV. And what do they call that -- obstetrician? [Mother: for the woman; for the baby it's pediatrician.] But I mean when the baby's pregnant. [Mother: no, when the mother's pregnant with the baby.]  [Mother: you mean the mother's going to have the baby, not the baby's going to have the mother. That's the obstetrician.] Yeah, that's what I mean!  Anyway, the obstetrician is Dr. Rosenwax -- she blabbed it all over TV. But anyway, so there were these ducks and these geese hanging out by these kids and they were so tame. And I was over at another booth doing something, and I was crawling over to the booth where my mother is because there were these air vent gratings in this tent thing, and I was crawling on this tent material over to where my mother was. And then I was just sitting down doing nothing, and I had my mini-disc recorder for WLFA, but I didn't have the personal CD player. Next thing I knew I was riding home in the car with Tim Dil Peterson, and he was talking to me about editing and stuff, and about -- I forgot my personal CD player, but I could have transferred some songs to the mini disc player so I could have one thing to do both jobs. And then I woke up."

There was like a podium on each side of the stage with a speaker mounted in it, and on the back of the podium there was, where the person stands, there were the two binding post connections and they were like running wires all over the stage getting them back to the main unit. And then next thing I knew, I was still laying down on the stage while they were doing all this, they were putting \"Planet Soul\" on the CD player and they're playing it , and next thing I know we're all standing up and we're posing for a picture.

We mostly just stayed at one end of the park and walked around and stuff. And then we met up with my father over at the petting zoo section and all the girls went on to do something else, and I was stopping and talking, and I was standing under the post of the fence of the petting zoo and I was talking and she said that there's this, he was glad we stayed on this side and all. And I was thinking, \"Yeah, of course she would be.\" And there was this person that was going to do a concert show that was a guitarist from the '50's, and I didn't know the difference in my dream between a gunner and a guitarist, so I kind of thought that guns were like guitars and guitars were like guns. I don't know why I would think something so whacko. I mean, they're, I don't know, they don't even make a similar sound. Well anyway, and then I dreamt that we were home and I was looking around the house as if it were Tyme Gardens, trying to find stuff, and then I realized I was at home and I shouldn't even be looking. Then I dreamt that Sheryl, Sandra and Sam were in town, which they were because they were at Tyme Gardens with us. And they were, I mean, I was laying in bed and Sam was like in the shower and he had this tube and he was spraying water at me and stuff. And so I closed the door.

Your mother kept asking us to take it each time we came, and I didn't want to take it because Dawn [their real mother] said don't take stuff from you.\" And I was just like, \"Okay,\" I wasn't hurt or anything, I mean, I was just sort of like, \"Okay.\" And I was drawing little bitty pictures in this notebook while I was talking to her.

I put my two hands on it. There was enough span for the bass clef and the treble clef, and I started playing the accompaniment for Easy Like Sunday morning. And Sandra was like, \"Wow, girl!\" And my father was out in the yard and he could hear it, and then here comes the really bizarre part. We were getting ready to go to this thing at the city Performing Arts Center and Sandra and my father wanted to go with us, but I guess they weren't ready. I was just like in the car in the passenger seat, and the car was just going where I needed it to go. And it was just going on the interstate, 70 mph and it got off the exit at the right exit, and the only problem I had that it needed to be driven was when it came time to park, and since I wasn't steering it, it parked kind of cockeyed across three other spaces. And it was twirling around a little tiny bit. And I shut off the ignition just in time before it crashed into something. And oh, when I was on the interstate, I could see around me, everybody in the truck behind me. I could see my mother and Sandra in the truck behind me, and so when I got parked, shortly after that my mother pulled up in the truck. And I had to tell her how cockeyed the car parked, and Sandra was there and I didn't want my father to know that I \"drove\" even though I didn't drive all by myself. And we were going to race home and get him, but we decided, \"Nah,\" and I don't remember too much after that, but I do remember that we were all at this like camp fire celebration with these fireworks going off later on.

And I went in the bathroom to go to the bathroom and there was this faucet on the wall, like opposite the toilet, and there were two of them and they were just spraying water out of control.

They were spraying after me as I went and I just closed the door and I said, \"Alright.\" And then I got my shoes and stuff and told my mother about it, and I don't remember what she said. But that was short-lived. The other weird dream I had was I dreamt that Sheryl and Sandra and I were going through my magic show stuff. And there was this recording of me doing a magic show a long time ago and people cheering and clapping, playing even one of the magic show things. And then I said, \"Where is that coming from?\" and Sheryl pulled out this mechanical chickie and she said, \"This is a magic chick; now watch it.\" And it had like a little heart thing on its hand; you know how mechanical things do. And when you would press it, it would say, \"Hi, I'm a magic chick. If you want to play magic,\" something about the something blue. You'd have to activate a blue king or blue foot thing or something. And then it would say, \"Hi, I'm a magic chick, if you want to play magic,\" something like that, and then it would start to play this recording of when I would do magic shows. That was like weird."

It was like a traveling duffel bag, and it was for the keyboard. It was like put the batteries in all in series, and my mother said that it reminded her of cow poop, the way you put them in.

And I know this is really stupid, but I'm going to have to say it anyway in order so that I can analyze my thoughts later. I dreamt that in order for the keyboard to work, we had to bake a cake, and there was this cake. And everybody would eat a piece of the cake, and when it was all gone, it wouldn't work any more. And I don't know what the connection was or why that happened like that, but it was weird. And it wasn't anything wild like he used to do. He was really sincerely trying to learn a song, and it was the Entertainer song that the ice cream truck plays all the time. And let's see, I dreamt that we also had a pineapple cake and a pear cake that I really wanted a piece of, but apparently my mother said they had containers that snapped shut and she couldn't get them open without making a whole bunch of noise. But she wanted to save them for when it was just us, so when I wanted a piece of cake, I had to have the other cake that made the thing work. That is so bizarre. How bizarre; how bizarre. And I also remember that later on I got my school schedule, and we had to whip up this like cake mix in order for my schedule to coincide.  And it was this like real powdery, awful-tasting cake mix we just had to whip up, and we had to spread it all over everywhere.  And I dreamt that I was going around on my first school schedule and that I stayed back and was talking and talking with Mrs. Dougherty with my mother, and that I missed Math completely, and there was an absence on my first day. And my father was complaining about it, and we said, \"What's he complaining about now?\" And there were these pictures, and there was one of Mrs.Gresham, there was one of Mrs. Hollander and there was one of Mrs. Dougherty. There were these pictures that were like photo pictures, I guess. And Mrs. H.'s was bigger than life, and it was like almost poster size except it was just the head. And she had a blue background, like she had this beaver outfit on like she was this beaver on stage, and her hand was extending off to the side into the next picture. And her hand was extending like almost over the top of the Mrs. Dougherty picture, except you could still see her. It was just that the hand was in the way of the picture. And I dreamt that I was going to enlarge the other one and fix it up and get rid of Mrs. H.'s hand and all, so that hers would be bigger than life.

So we got in these escalators and held onto the railings. They went twice as fast as normal ones do. I think maybe even three times faster. We went up four or five of them until we got to like this place where there were chairs for everybody and a little road thing. And I sat on a ramp right in the front, and my feet like dangled into the middle of the road thing, and then Mrs. Hollander told us that we were too early and we have to come back in a half an hour.

I don't know where this came from, but I did participate in a wedding and was the DJ, so maybe that's it. But anyway, I dreamt that our foyer was like four or five times as big as it really is, and I had my equipment set up and I was lining up CD's and getting ready because I had the notion that the prom people were going to just start filling up, coming in the house and filling up our foyer. And so I'm getting ready, getting techno stuff together and all, and next thing I know, my equipment won't work right and I have to have like a long time to like, I'm looking for this certain connector that I need and I can't find it. For some reason I need a 8\" mini connection, and I usually don't use that unless I'm using my boom box, but I wasn't this time, so I don't know. Then I suddenly dreamt that -- this must have been another one of those dreams that you have that feel like they're connected -- I dreamt that we were at Elizabeth's house and we were in this small, tiny little kitchen that led out into this grand foyer with this staircase and everything. And it was pouring down rain outside. And I think it was Elizabeth's cousin or brother-in-law -- some relative of hers that was kind of a young man in his 20s. And he was telling me about how he likes to play the trumpet. And I guess it was Thomas, because Thomas plays the trumpet. And he was saying how a keyboard is such a great thing because you can make it make all kinds of different sounds. And if you don't really play a certain instrument, but you want it in your song, you can make it make that sound if it's the right kind of synthesizer. And by this time I was like swinging on a swing, hanging from one of these stairwell things, and I think my mother comes in from the pouring rain and we go in that small little kitchen, and Elizabeth's asking about a mini disc. She thinks she wants to have something in the mini disc format. And so I told her I would show her my recorder from WM&F; and then I woke up."

And I don't remember if I set it up or not, and I don't even remember what she was telling me, but I do remember going in the bathroom and seeing this huge like garbage disposal like type thing. And people would throw their garbage in it, they would throw their dirty laundry in it, and there was a little toilet on top. People would even go to the bathroom in it. And they would like flush this _____ handle that would be like flushing a toilet. And for some reason I had the notion that it was getting plugged up and stuff and we were going to have to take some of the dirty laundry out of there. That was cuckoo, man!"

And I dreamt that I got it online and I got two of the raw materials to do it. I got the stand and the top, and the aquarium itself was going to be in a teapot and I got that. And I set it on the counter ready to go, and I, all of a sudden I was in this reception hall with my system, Peavey system set up and I was adjusting the faders so somebody could talk on the microphone as they wished and it wouldn't feed back.  And I couldn't remember who was talking on it or what they said, but they were walking around pretty good and I was real nervous they were going to go over too close to the speakers and make it feed back, and then I would be blamed for it. And I do remember there was a guy next to me which I was adjusting the equalizer, well, while the person was talking on the microphone I started a Kenny D CD playing, and the EQ just sounded terrible, so I was sitting there adjusting it. And I was telling this guy that was sitting there that I keep my hand on the microphone fader so that if it starts to feed, I can just bring it down immediately. And I remember then we were starting to pack it up, and for some reason I realized I was naked. And I was putting all the stuff back in the boxes. I only put one of the speakers on top of the Peavey box and my father was already hauling it out to the truck and there was another stand standing freely. Then I don't remember what happened, and then I woke up."

We were at my tech school taking a tour and we had this -- it was Elizabeth, me, my mother and Angel, I think -- we had this really funny elevator we had to keep going up and down. And we were in the lobby that looked like the reception hall where we had the wedding, and then we came down this funny elevator and we landed in the parking garage, supposedly go into another building. And we saw Mrs. Hollander across the parking lot, which is the lady who gave me the four-year degree lecture several times.

And, of course, I thought that my distress was finally known to them. And it was really that there was a storm coming, and so because there was a storm coming, we headed home. And I had the notion that we were driving Grandpa and Carl and Arlene in our car, which we went to lunch with them yesterday, so that's probably it. But we only drove Grandpa. And we dropped Grandpa off at his house, but then we brought Carl and Arlene home.

I had a mixer the exact design, and they like went together like a set, and they were both sitting on top of my dresser.

First I dreamt that I was in the bedroom and I was trying to set up a two-channel stereo system. Or no, I was trying to fix the speaker connection because they'd come undone. So I shut off the receiver and unplugged it just to be safe. And I was making the connections with the binding posts -- you know how that goes -- and I dreamt that in my dream we had a sub in the bedroom, which we don't. And that seemed to be alright; I didn't have to do anything like that. So I fixed the connections and then I turned the receiver back on and I was putting the speaker back in place, and the wires came undone. And I was real afraid to touch them because, of course, when the receiver's on they're carrying power and I knew not to touch them or I'd be shocked. And then I dreamt that my father was baking a mixer cake. By the way, this dream is going to probably take up the whole of this tape. I dreamt that my father was baking a mixer cake and it was really cool, and he was kind of joking, like he is, about \"Don't let my mother get all the cake,\" and stuff, and we were deciding on sizes for the cake by how many faders we have because we were cutting the cake with lines and we were cutting it according to, like we would say, \"I want four of these channel strips, so I want two of the shell (?) strips,\" and that would be how we'd know what sizes of the cake we want. Then I dreamt that I was writing these notes about how my life is being changed over the years, and I was writing these notes so that I could write this essay. And I was writing about the different phases that I went through, like first it was the toddler stage and then my animal magic show stage was 6-9, and I said that I had went through a real shy phase when I was little, which I really didn't, but in my dream I thought I had. And in all of this my father asked about the music major, and, of course, I hadn't said anything, I haven't said anything to him about it. So I just kind of said, like I just kind of like beat around the bush, I guess. And he asked about it more directly again, and I was kind of stunned. Well, actually, I wasn't really too, too stunned yet, and I just said, \"Oh, we found it like 20 years later and it needed work,\" or something like that. I then I stepped away to do something and he's baking another cake. Or I think then I come home from shopping with my mother, and there it is, sitting on the table, and all the flour and all the mess. And it's like sitting there in all its glory, and I'm like stunned.  But the thing of it is, my father thinks he can connect the mixer cake to it.  And it was hilarious because it's not even a real mixer he's trying to connect to it. And I know for a fact that it didn't have any a______ or audio out, but I was able to microphone it and record it through my mixer.  Here he is, trying to connect a mixer cake to it. And I'm like, he's having my mother and I help him like move stuff, and I'm like grabbing my mother's wrist and like doing the intermittent grip signal, like, \"Oh my gosh, what in the world is happening here?\" And I hated to see it in all the flour and all the mess, but everybody was trying to connect it to a real mixer. Oooohhhhhh! But, and then, I had one more part to this dream. I guess you could see why I'm wide awake! Then we were in Cash and Carry and we were looking at Easter bunnies, and over in the Easter Department we were looking at Easter bunnies and I was dancing to this disco music under this strobe light.  I guess I meant what I said in my song when I said, \"When I run through the pastures of my slumber, you're never out of sight.\" I feel I need to add to this that I didn't really feel was important, but now I see it could have some meaning. I dreamt that I was wearing a tee-shirt with a picture of it on it, almost like the tree bird shirt, only it wasn't. It was the color of the tree bird shirt and it had a picture of it on it, only I was walking through Cash and Carry. And I think maybe this could mean that some day -- how should I say it -- I think that I mean to say that some day I'll be brave enough and confident enough to tell the world its story and wear it openly on my heart instead of hidden the way it is now. And I don't know -- I just [sigh], I've just still got this shy thing going on, I don't know."

There was a keyboard in there too, and we were all sitting out in the main room talking, and there was this dog that was running around. And then we decided we would all move into the side room for some reason and the keyboard was by this time kind of in the way, kind of half blocking the doorway and they were kind of worried that I was going to knock it over. But, of course, I just kind of stood there and like stared for a minute at it, and Mr. Fayne told me not to touch it because she had no idea what it was going to do or sound like. So we all sat down on this little couch thing and we started talking. There were chairs and a couch in this room, and we like resumed our conversation.

There's only a tap, tap, tap, tap. And it's like, what in the world? I guess we know where that came from. And then I woke up and I went back to sleep and I dreamt, I kind of like resumed the dream. I dreamt that we were still in the same house and that I had to get my mother's boom box out of the attic. This house was like some modern house downstairs, but it was our upstairs. So I got my mother's boom box out of the attic, and somehow I had the notion that the people's keyboard wouldn't work because the record key on my mother's boom box was broken off. So I was like trying to fix it, but I think \"record\" and \"play\" were like attached together somehow and I was trying to figure how to attach it back on so that I could record somebody saying something with the boom box. And I attached it the wrong way first, so I had to like take it off and reattach it. And, you know, that's all I remember at this time. What a shame! I should have done this when I first woke up.

And then I remember that after we put the candles out, I went down and I locked the front door. And then I went to come upstairs and look for Sandra, and I told her I didn't really feel safe until I locked the front door. Then I dreamt that I was setting up my equipment at the picnic table and I had Peavey mixer, I had the amplifier and the CD writer and stuff, and I was setting up the wireless microphone. But I couldn't find the right connection for the receiver and the X (?) alarm wouldn't go in right, and I turned it on and I had the fader all the way down, but I turned it on and it made the loudest squeal of feedback I've ever heard in my life. And I dreamt that I was trying to connect these two quarter-inch connectors to the board, but they were all dirty and acidy and stuff, and I was wishing I had some of that spray that O'Brien had, because I think I had dropped them in the dirt or something like that.

I can't remember exactly what they did, but I remember we were riding some rides and it's too many in my dream, and it was really, really fun. And then we were at home and for some reason my father had some errands to do or something, so he was hanging like that in the truck and would drive away for like half hour to an hour increments, I don't know, something like that. And I was setting up to jam in my studio. Of course the task ____ board is on my desk now, but here's, my mother gave me this fresh set of batteries from somewhere and they were fresh and there was no ones in her boom box. And the next, oh boy, this is getting just all fragmented, isn't it?  My mother was fixing supper and it was going to be on any minute, but I had to do it, so I put this sign on my door, \"Do not enter, surprise things.\" And I tested out the keyboard again with the fresh set of batteries my mother gave me, and lo and behold, it worked beautifully. And I set it up on the stool, the black stool, since my desk was taken over by the task ____ board, and I don't remember too much of what my session was like, but I do remember feeling really, really good that it was resurrected again. Of course, when I woke up, I realized it was only a dream, and I was like, \"Oh man!\" But this is one of these dreams that really gives you a good feeling when you wake up, just all around. The rides were fun, everything was fun, and it feels like [sings a little song] \"______ in the song I sing today . You're in my dreams at night, and when I rise, there's a ______ of my slumber.

And then I sort of dreamt that I was seeing red and signs with red writing and I was hearing the first two notes of \"Blue Bird\" repeated over and over and over, kind of at a fast tempo. And I was seeing all this red, and It was really scary. And I was sort of somewhat conscious to know that I was in my room, but I was seeing all this red. And then next thing I know I hear my father's voice, and he said, well first, then I dreamt that the radio was on and it was playing this song from 94.1. Again I was conscious that I was in my room. And I heard, there was this one jazz song called \"Turn Off the Light\" and my father was there and he was saying, \"When you hear this song, sing lilacs and lilacs, because if you sing, \"Turn Off the Light\" at night, it'll make you think of dark and you'll be scared. That was kind of, I don't know, a little on the bizarre side. The other one was much sweeter."

We were sitting around on the picnic table listening to some rap song on the garage outside system that we used to have. And we were like writing songs and stuff for this band, and I was like ready to play the drums on the picnic table. And I don't know, but some time before that I was working in the kitchen and I lost my thumb, my left thumb got just sliced off by a knife, and it didn't hurt me too bad or anything. I was just going around without a thumb, without a left thumb. And they called me the thumbless tin smith . That was pretty cool, I thought."

And then I went back to sleep and had another dream, that, well, maybe this was like a continuation of that one, I don't know. I was at Sunset Grill with my equipment, and instead of Suzy Barton being there, there were these three or four boys that were kind of rough. And I had the Peavey system set up and I had the CD writer set up. I was going to burn some CD's. And I was up on the stage and in back of the stage there was this wall where I had a few shelves where I put some equipment. And the boys were on stage announcing and I was sitting back there with my, I was facing the wall, facing the equipment. And I turned on my microphone and it made feedback, and somehow I had the notion that it was because I had two CD writers -- one was mine that I use and one was this white one. And I dreamt that this white one had faulty circuitry, and it was letting signals through that were causing feedback.  Now how whacked out is that! Oh, and the plot thickens!  So I gave that white CD writer to the boys, and in exchange they gave me this personal CD/ tape player and they gave me a Spice Girl's tape . And so we got home and my father and I are working on DP, and this personal CD tape player is kind of unique in that it's like an interface with DP. That's bizarre!

The only thing was the golden chicken was a mean old pecker. She would peck people. And I think the other white chicken was too. It was kind of hard to tell the difference between the old white and brown and the new white and brown. And then I dreamt that I had had a baby. I wasn't sure if had a baby or a baby doll, but I was singing to it. Or I just remember sort of telling somebody that I was singing to a baby. I couldn't remember if I was singing \"Brahms Lullaby\" or \"La La Loo.\" But then I was at school and I was in English class, but first I was waiting to get into English class and there was like this thing in the hallway that was like a steering wheel. It was green and it would say if you turn it, the alarm will sound. So I had to get away from that one. The college rep person was there and a few other students were there following me to English class because they needed to get there too. And there was like, I told them I'm usually very leery of red things because red represents seeing an alarm, but this time it was green for some reason. So we got into English class and we were kind of sitting there listening to this college rep guy advertising I think he was talking about USC and how great it is and how great their scholarships are, and, \"If you drop out, we'll hold your scholarship for ten years and if you come back, we'll still give it back to you.\" And I was r_____ there and I was looking through this book he gave me, and while I was -- well, this is the funny part -- while I was sitting there looking at this book of scholarship stuff, I started to get a little nervous and a little afraid because I was thinking of the song I was singing to the baby and I was also thinking about how we were calling ourselves Mamaloo, Papaloo, Babyloo, Chickenloo and Roosterloo.

So I got in the car, I started it up and I sat in the back seat, and it just took off from there and it just sort of knew where I wanted to go. And it stopped and it parked itself in the parking lot when we got there. Like I said, I don't remember what it was, but I remember getting out and talking to somebody in the parking lot and being real afraid because I don't look like I'm of age to drive. Then by the time it was time for me to come home, it was dark and I was really afraid because I was going to crash somewhere. And again, I started it up and I sat in the big seat with this ____ thing, and it just sort of knew when to stop at this traffic light and knew where to turn -- that was so crazy! But when we got to Allison's, we were almost home and we were coming down 5th Street, and we were at Allison's and it just sort of stopped in front of her house. And Megan came up to me and started asking questions, and I didn't want to start it up and move it home because Megan was right there and she would think it's funny. And so after talking to Megan, I just walked home and I put the boom box out on the front lawn and played some CD's and I sat in the green chair. And then I woke up."

And then when I was walking up to get the newspaper at 24th Avenue and 7th Street, I was still carrying the mini disc recorder and the straight lavaliere microphone in my other hand to get any kind of other sounds I could, and I saw Mrs. Dougherty at the corner there when I was getting the paper and she said, \"No wonder no more people made comments. You had that thing!\" Oh, I know, I left it like in the grass the next block away, and then I went up to see her and then she said that.

And the cellar, it wasn't fully lit, but it had these little like spotlights -- I guess they call them emergency lights -- around, and a few candles that were lit. And it had some flashing lights on the railing like emergency vehicles have. And my mother took me down there and she was showing me how to turn on the other lights. See, what people did when they went down into the cellar, okay, so what a person would do when they'd go down in this cellar, is they would turn on the big lights before they turned off the small lights, because if they turned off the small lights first, they would be in total darkness. And I was trying to tell my mother -- she like had me on her shoulder -- I was trying to tell her to turn on the other lights before she showed me how to turn off the small lights, but she didn't listen to me and we turned off the small lights and we were in total darkness.

And so they had flabbing toilets and flabbing sinks in the boys' bathroom at school. So I had to run past that.

There were like two or three bowls of snacks at each table. And there was a pool at this house. And there was like this man. We were on the second floor and we were on a balcony overlooking the pool and this man was like giving us very specific instructions about how to open bags of snacks and serve them, and when to put more out and when to leave the bowls empty, and not to put too much out. And on further analysis, I think this man must have been Mace, Barbara's husband, because when they sent us our invitation, they gave us real specific instructions as to when to come, where to park, don't bring a gift, and please let other people sit down and eat when you're done, and all kinds of stuff like that. So I think that's where that came from. Also something very strange -- the past two times I have dreamt about hearing the \"Wee Sing\" tape, I've been really, really scared and wanting to cling to my mother when \"Blue Bird\" is about to come on. I stopped having dreams like that a while ago, and whenever I would dream about the tape, it wouldn't be scary.

And \"Blue Bird\" came on and I just clung to her and I was like, \"Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God\" and I was ready to start crying and things. And then I slowly faded into consciousness and I woke up. I don't know what all that's about. But at least the good news is, is I don't wake up really scared like I used to.

And then Uncle Fred told my mother and my father what I really wanted. Next thing I knew, it was set up on a little tray like my typing keyboard is in my studio. Well, it was set up on a little tray in the TV cabinet in the living room, between the TV and the amplifier. And when my father and I were sitting there listening to Celine Dion, I got up from the couch and moved the computer chair over in front of the TV cabinet and I pulled out that little tray, and we were hearing this the way it is, and I was trying to play it along with the CD, which I think it was a horrible job, but I don't know. It was just a dream anyway. And then I stood up and I was going over to my father to ask him how he thought I did. He was sound asleep. He was snoring away, which I thought it was pretty good because I really didn't want him to see me and hear my anyway.  Then the next time I sat down was when nobody was in the house, and I thought, \"Okay, I am going to sit down and practice and do a decent job this time.\" And I sat down and turned it on and it was not connected to the amplifier any more, so I sat down and started checking it out. The amplifier was as light as a feather, so I just lifted it off the shelf and turned it around and looked at the back of it, and it was nothing like I'm used to seeing when I'm conscious. There were no RCA (?) connections whatsoever. It looked more like the back of the car radio, which is probably because that's what we were kind of doing like a few days ago. And I was trying to find a way to kind of jam some bare wire into some connection so that I could get this connection made and get this thing connected to the amplifier again. And just as I was doing that, I heard my mother and my father coming home in the car and I had wires and connections and stuff all over the living room. And I didn't want them to see that I had been messing around, so I met my father at the door and said, \"You can't come in right now, I'm working on a surprise.\" And he said, \"Well, just guide me in, I'll close my eyes.\" And then I woke up, realized it was all a dream and said he can come in if he wants to.

And I finally said, \"Okay, I'm shutting down and I'm getting out of here.\" So I closed it down and set it down, and next thing I know, I'm at school and my mother's a little late and I'm racing to get to Mr. Simpson's class on time because I dreamt that it was his exam I had to take. And what the material of his exam was going to consist of was reacting appropriately to a fire drill. And we were racing to get to his class before the alarm class, and we didn't make it. It went off while we were in the hall, and, you know, sound, acoustics-wise, the hall is the worst place you could be when the fire alarm goes off. Then I don't remember too much more, and then I woke up."

And, like I said, the main unit looks just like my mini disc recorder, and there's this magnet that connects to it, and you have to put the magnet on the front of your good foot.

But I had the notion that it was one of Celine Dion's first albums, so I picked that one out. And there was another called \"The Swedes\" -- you know, like people from SwAnthony, the Swedes. And it was the soundtrack to a musical where Celine Dion was the main girl in it, and it was done kind of like in opera except it was sung with regular voices and not operatic voices. And here's how the story line basically went: there was this girl who lived in this big house and she was sick and tired of being a servant. And that's the girl that Celine Dion played. And her two sisters were kind of competing to marry this rich guy, and one of the sisters died and one of the sisters found somebody else. And the rich guy was kind of left hanging, and the servant girl ended up marrying the rich guy and got out of being a servant, which is what she wanted. And there were, this CD, this story was told in songs on this CD. And I had this like baby CD player in my closet that I was playing this CD on, and it was light blue and it had like red buttons on it. And it was like for babies. And I'm in my closet listening to this, with my door closed, and my mother needed me to come downstairs for something, and then I woke up. But that was kind of cool. You know, maybe she will play in a movie. Singers who like go and act, I think they kind of get distracted from their singing. So it's good that she never tried to act."

Oh, I know what it was now! I had set up, well, first of all, I dreamt that all of my sound equipment resided on the computer desk downstairs and that the PC was really the Mac that ran this little performer, and it was all down there. And I had set it up in just a certain way, and there were these three or four people who wanted to see it, how it worked. And all of a sudden the three or four people dwindled down to one girl, and so I explained the difference between the two mixers -- the Peavey and the tascam -- but in my dream they were both black. Then this girl turns on the computer and she's waiting for it to start up, and she doesn't see a desktop right away and she gets a little alarmed, like, \"Hey! Where does this reside in the...\" and then she was like, \"This program, Digital Performer you're talking about, where does it reside?\" And I was like, \"Just be patient; it will come up.\" And so when it came up, the desktop was green and I showed her the icon as to where to go and stuff, and I don't remember too much about what she saw when she got in the program or what her reaction to it was. But I do remember all of a sudden there were a ton of people, like Uncle Carl and Aunt Joyce and a bunch of other family people and a bunch of the Fire Department people. And all of a sudden they wanted me to sing for them, so I go up and I start warming up. Now, you know that when I set up my equipment, I know at least a day in advance so I have a whole half an hour to set it up, to get ready to be amplified on the system. Well, I just wanted to have some accompaniment this time, and I had some stuff started on the CD RW, but my CD recorder is the only one that'll play CD RW's, so I was really in a rock and a hard place because what I was fixing to do was record it onto a tape and play the tape on my mother's boom box while I sang along and not involve the sound system this time, which is what I did, and I came downstairs with the boom box and I set it up, and all the people were gone. There was only like one person and my father in the living room. And my father was like, \"You'd better go out there and yell to them. They're all in their cars.\" And so I went out there, and I yelled, \"Hey, you guys!\" And they were all gone. But the bird was just going nuts, screeching and screeching and screeching. So I yelled at him, I was going, \"Hey, Archie, stop!\" And at that point some car honked its horn. It had a really funny sound to it. And then I went back inside, and I figured, \"Well, that's a wash. That was a lot of work for nothing.\" And even the girl was gone, who was supposedly looking at Digital Performer. And so I went upstairs and I was arranging some stuff back to the way it was, and I realized that I had left the sub on from the last time I had the sound system on, and you know how they require more power and so they have their own amplifiers. So you gotta click the switch on and off, so I forgot to click the switch off and I could hear that it had a little bit of chubba chubba chubba chubba sound, which meant there was an internal cooling fan cooling it off. And so I figured I'll shut it off so it'll quit getting hot and it'll cool itself off. So I reach down, I clicked the switch off, but when I did that, its fan like kicked in full force and it blew all this warm air out at me, and I was like so spooked by that and I ran out of my studio with a yell! And that was funny! And I was still spooked and I jumped up on my bed, and I set my hand down and there was a moth ball under my covers, but I got so scared, I thought it was either a mouse or something. So I screamed again.  And my father was like, \"Are you alright?\" And then I woke up.  That was crazy, man."

And he turns around and he throws it back at us, but he doesn't hit us, fortunately.  That was weird. And this is the most startling and weird part of all. It wasn't scary, but it was weird. It was disappointing. I dreamt that my mother's Bose wave radio CD and her boom box both needed batteries to run. Her Bose thing needed AA's and the boom box needed C's, like it's always needed. And I dreamt that they were both prone to falling out of the machine, and with both machines, if the batteries would fall out while the machine is playing, it would start making this, \"Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo\" sound instead of your audio. And you'd think if it would still have enough power to make that sound, you'd think it would have enough power to keep playing your audio, but no! So I dealt with that for a while, and in my dream it was scary, and so I was thinking up all kinds of ways to tape the -- the thing of it is, I don't think the boom box had a door to keep them in and so they would fall out.

He was really doing a lot of stuff with the City, but I dreamt that he was training these actors and actresses and he was part of the scenery. And I was asking him about what he does, and he didn't want to tell because he said he's sworn to secrecy and he doesn't want the word to get out. And I was thinking, \"Man, that's a show that I really like, and I never knew that my father was part of it until now?\" And let's see, I know there was something else. And we were taking this walk, and he was kind of telling me something. And we were with Clark and Marylou and a couple other people. And I think I was in a hurry to get home because I knew Mrs. Dougherty was coming over, so then I tell him I'm going to break away from the crowd and I start running. And I'm almost home, and then I woke up. [I dreamt that Mom and I, when I was sight reading, that we kept getting interrupted because the first time I tested it out, it took me a while to hem and haw and get over the heebie jeebies and stuff, and finally admit to myself that it's okay to be a little kind of cheesy and all, and so, but that day when I was doing that for the first time back in June, Mom and my father had gone, were going to go to a movie, which they did, but my father left to go do an errand real quick. And Mom thought that she was too late and that he had left for the theater without her, and so she got on her bike and rode down to the theater. And then my father came home and wondered where she went and I told him that she had gone to the theater, and so they said that they would meet up. So then when he left, I was reasonably sure that it was safe, and I took it out after some hemming and hawing and all that, and it was sitting on its -- oh, I get so tongue-tied! -- anyway, it was sitting on the bed in all its glory when first the phone rings. It's Mom calling from a pay phone to say that she hadn't seen my father yet. Then I hang up the phone and I go back to what I'm doing, and then the phone rings again like two minutes later, and it's my father to say that he met up with Mom. So then I go back to my business, and while I'm talking on the phone, I'm just hoping that nobody's going to come to the door.  And let's see, oh yeah, and then I go back to business, and then Christian calls! And I'm like, \"Jiminy Christmas, when are these phone calls going to leave me alone!?\"  And another funny thing that happened is I took care of that and I set it aside. I put it back in its box and I went to set up the sound system for my father's party that was going to happen that night, and I was done, and so I figured, \"Well, I've got an extra hour before they're supposed to come home. I can go learn some more songs.\" And so I took it out again, I set it up, and so I'm learning, \"My Heart Will Go On\" by ear, and I'm chipping and chipping away at way, screwing up here and messing up there, making a terrible total mess of it, but having fun. And next thing I know, what do I hear but the truck, and remember how those keys to turn it on and off are so difficult, and you can't do it with the wrong kind of touch. You can't do it with nervous fingers. And, of course, I was like, \"Ahhhhhh, oh, my gosh!\" And I finally was able to turn it off and saw the LED's go dark, and I shoved it back in its box so fast, and I shoved the box back in its corner. I raced down to meet them, trying to be as calm as I can -- that was some ordeal! But, you know, Mom found out anyway because, first of all, I couldn't keep it from her too long. You know, I tell her everything. And second of all, the box is right by the phone and so when I put the box back, it sat on top of the phone cord, and she knew that I'd been handling it.]"

And the next thing I knew, we were in a boat, or we were getting ready to go on a boat with some of the people, and the engine wouldn't start and I was sitting there on the boat with a boom box. The engine wouldn't start and there was this certain tour boat starter thing that made a lot of noise that would start the engine, but first I wanted to get off the boat and go walk around on this little island in the main group while they were doing that.

And he was obsessed with people knowing where they are and people feeling safe, but yet he did these things that really wouldn't make them, or really wouldn't make me feel any safer, like, for example, he wanted to put a little alarm thing that kind of sounded like back-up alarms near people's houses so that they would always know where they are. Well, for me that would be just awful. And he wanted to wait until they were sleeping so they couldn't say anything, and he needed a cool, breezy night to do it. And I think what he was going to do was tap into their plumbing pipes and stick it in lines and that when they turn on their water, the water would go through and activate it. And then he was also wanting to put them in elevators so that if people get stuck, they could make enough racket and be heard. Well, and then we finished the story, and we were starting to look at it and questions. Oh, and I walked out of English class with this girl named Marilla who I have, that sits next to me with my internship seminars. But here she was in my English class and I walked out with her. We were going down the stairs and there, set up on the landing of the stairwell, was a little sound booth, recording studio-like type thing. And Elizabeth and this boy sat down and they were listening to this tape of this band that was playing, and the monitors were facing us because there were microphones and they didn't want them to fade. And I went over there and sometimes I have a bad habit of using -- not necessarily a bad habit, but I have a habit of using two fingers to move faders instead of one, because when I want to move them in small increments I just two fingers. I went over there and I adjusted some of the faders and Elizabeth kind of was surprised at my two finger grip and she said, \"Why don't you just use one finger?\" And I was like, \"Because two fingers is more precise for me.\" And about that time I woke up."

Well I thought that we could get more chairs if we took the yellow table and moved it over to the side, and we put Sam and Nikki and Bart and Christian over there, and then we could seat -- one, two, three, four, five, six -- we could seat six at our little table that we had joined and then we could have a total of ten seats.  That was kind of odd. And then we went up to this, oh, and in this ballroom they had like couches around the perimeter for some reason. And then in the, we were up at the counter and they gave us our, all the food for the buffet to take home so that we could keep it cold. That was strange."

And there was another school parading past us. We didn't want to jump in their line and screw up their order. So we waited until they went by and then we raced up to our warm up room to find out that I didn't have my black shoes. I had my white shoes. And my mother was saying that Josie probably had some. I had the notion that she was there. And then they said, \"Just don't worry about it.\" This was the wrong day anyway. We were supposed to come on a different day. And then another dream, I dreamt that there was this TV commercial advertising like a Frankenstein series of like shows, like Jag. And it showed Madonna talking to Victor, and she said, almost like a kid playing -- first she said, \"There's something I know you know how to do, so let's do it.\" And at that she created another person, I think. And it was like, \"Whoa!\" And oh yeah, then a little transient dream I had was there was an empty vitamin bottle and my mother wanted me to put it outside for the chickens, and she said, \"Let's give the chickens a nothing treat!\"  And then I said, \"Okay, let's give the chickens a nothing treat,\" so and I was getting ready to put it outside, but then I realized it still had half my vitamins in it so I put it back in the fridge.

That was pretty odd. And also, I think at the same time, they were doing some kind of concert where they had these like mini synthesized accompaniments and various people were coming up to sing.

The Celine Dion exhibit was kind of blah. It was set up on a table and it was a board, this round wooden board, and there was this real cheap, short, stout chinsy plastic figure of her holding a guitar. And there was this magnet and this magnet would move her around the board as the song My Heart Will Go On would play on this blah thing that was there. There was a whole other room that we hadn't gotten to yet, but there was this red door that said, \"Teacher's Exit\" and I had the notion that when you go out it, it would make an alarm sound. So it would go into like in a kitchen thing. Oh, I know, all of a sudden I had my CD writer there, and I am recording something, the machine freezes like it did for me yesterday. It keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, then I realize that we started a fire. So we were running around now in the house, so we're running around and we don't know what to do, but the porch is like really long. Remember the teacher's exit, I tell my mother, \"Open the door and run out,\" but she doesn't.

And he wanted to make sure I could see all of them by asking me where to find the keys that went up or down, the volume ____. And I found them like in the bottom right area, and I upped the CD about three or four notches. And then I realized that in order to edit audio and put programs together, that I had to have these -- what's the material? -- I had to have these clay alphabet letter blocks, and a lot of them were attached together vertically in a column, and some were loose. And I didn't know what I had to do with these alphabet letter blocks, but I had a feeling it was like making a story board for a movie. And there was also this book that was like the length of a novel that went with it. And Frederick was going to try to teach me a few things so that I could make an order, because I had a notion that I was having a party that evening and I was going to make a border for the playlist for the party. And then we like ran out of time and he let me just take the thing home and learn some stuff on my own and show it to him on Monday, because he realized we weren't going to have any more time before the party. I remember looking at the time and it was 4:50 and I had to get home because the party was at 6:00.

And her phone was like whacko. It was like you would pick it up and instead of a dial tone, there was this commercial for like Spanish food, and you had to actually push a number before it would have a thing.

Before I finished, I hung up and there was, so I'm going to say that before I could get through, my mother came and picked me up, which was good, so I didn't have to call. She picked me up in the parking lot, and instead of the car, she had the blue car that was like all beat up and these broken windows and this yuckiness, and I kind of was a little startled, I was like, \"Where did you get this?\" and she was like, \"It's Joan's.\" And she said that it was a special model that was made to look like this to show that it had been through the war.

Matter of fact, let me say that, first of all, this dream was the first one that I've ever thought was too silly to put on this tape.  Here's what it was: I dreamt that I had to go to Grad Night that evening, which really is what is today, but before I went to Grad Night, my father put this responsibility on me that I had to prepare this little pizza thing in the fry pan, and I also had to turn on the air conditioner. And how you would do it is you would light a torch and you would kinda light the air conditioner with a torch, and the air conditioner, we called it the Hossle (?), so I had to take this torch -- believe it or not -- the plastic end (?) -- this gets sillier! There was this prize that I won from a raffle that was a little pocket torch keychain, like a cigarette lighter, except when you turn it on, it smells like a torch. And they called it a portable cruise torch. So I was using this portable cruise torch to light the Hossle and so I think I had to like turn it on and I got it near the air conditioner and it didn't light. It was starting to get out of control and so I threw it in the water to put it out, but it wouldn't go in the water. I ended up shoving it into the side of the blue cabinets, flame and all, then there was a towel close by and then I realized that it might burn things. So I took it and it got stuck like a magnet there. I had to like pull it off. And I threw it outside and I never did get the Hossle air conditioner lit, and I know there was more. I think I was trying to fix some kind of food for somebody, and I think somebody was coming to town, but I don't remember anything more."

            "content": "I had kind of a silly dream last night with a lot of silly things that weren't really connected in any kind of way. But first I dreamt that I was at school and I was trying to go somewhere. And the elevator in the main building was like real small, only enough to fit like me and another person. And I was in it by myself, and I had to go up to the third floor. And I kind of had the notion that there were more floors than three, so I kept pushing 3 to get to go up higher, and then all of a sudden I realized that it was going up past the third floor and into the control room shaft and the little trap door thing on the roof kind of lifted up for a minute and then banged down. And then I was like really scared because I thought I was stuck up there, and then I realized all I had to do was press 1 and it would start coming down again, which was exactly what it did. And another thing -- kind of later when I was outside -- I was walking down the hall and these two, this guy and this girl were talking about something juicy about their relationship, I guess, and they were like kinda singing and kinda talking, and I kind of thought they might be fighting even. And I was trying to follow them and hear what they were saying, and I followed them into this classroom and I sat down kind of in the back of a row and it was real noisy and stuff. And I realized I was in Ms. Marcos's class, in her 5th period, and I didn't want to be caught dead in a math class for an extra period than I had to be, so I got up and I walked out, and then I went downstairs, and I think I was going to some kind of party, but I woke up before I could get there."

            "content": "Two days ago I slept in Grady House when we were at hot springs and I had the dumbest, silliest, stupidest dream -- you would not believe! First of all, I dreamt that I was at school and it was kind of like one of my last dreams and we weren't doing much in class. And we were all kind of hanging out and partying and having assemblies and stuff, and there was this show, movie-like type thing that I was going to go and see in the auditorium with my mother. It was going to be a combination of Celine Dion and a few other people singing and doing things and stuff. And one of the officiants in the VE specialist office -- I can't remember her name -- but it was Mrs. Bernard or somebody -- was going to show me a shorter way to get there. And she said that I had to go through the Teacher's Lounge and through some teachers' special areas that no other students could go. Well, when I started going through that area with her, it was like a long hallway and a tunnel and several twists and several little office areas to go through, and there was this sound system that was very quiet, but audible, and very keen and very thin and very blah -- no frequency band width to it whatsoever. And so, of course, just like the Dome, it was mixed with this \"buzzzzzzzzzz\" sound, and as you were walking through this hallway, you would hear the sound coming, there would be the speakers mounted -- some on the ceiling, some on the walls kinda of close to my waist height, and some on the floor. And you would be walking by and any time you would get near one of them, and you could feel the sound waves. It would just give your muscles these sensations, these shaky, jittery sensations and you'd like fall down and stuff, like when I walked under one, it gave me these like tingles down my spine and just made me shudder. And then I passed one at my waist height and it like almost made me fall down. And there was one -- I was coming up to one that was on the floor -- and I just kind of totally like freaked out.  And I can't remember exactly what I did, but this assistant just kind of was walking along ahead of me and this was normal, and who was I to think it wasn't. And I think that I forgot something out of my locker, and I had to go all the way back around, but I went the long way and I wasn't going to go the short way, so I went the long way again. And then I finally got to the auditorium and the show was like starting already. And there were bleachers in there and I was walking down these big bleacher things, and actually there were like bleachers on the side and everybody in the middle had like normal seats. And I was going to sit on like one of the big bleacher platforms up real close so I could see. But I got there and I sat down, and Celine Dion was like in these long leather pants and this black top like I have, and she was singing something -- I don't remember what -- and then in the middle of a song she like takes off her clothes in front everybody and changes into this black dress that's kind of to her knees. And nobody does anything, nobody in the video audience or the real audience does anything. They're just like, \"Okay, this is normal.\"  You know, that's all I can remember. And I think there was some guy, like Michael Jackson who was singing too, and that's all. Obviously this was a spin-off on the Dome offices. It's just that my imagination went absolutely crazy because the Grady House had a whole house system too, and, of course, theirs sounded nice, but now I hope I'm not going to have this dreadful memory every time I hear a whole house system like that. It's just that I had this dying curiosity of how they work and what makes them work and how they're wired and stuff. But when I don't know these things, it's kind of frightful. I don't know how to describe it. Especially when they make weird sounds and so weird things like that."

And my mother was going to come and join me. And my mother went in the bathroom and said, \"I'll meet you guys outside.\" And Elizabeth and I went to this classroom that was set up with little work stations, and they were supposed to be like audio work stations, but ours was kind of like bland because somebody stole our mixer board, and there was just this TV playing like video footage that somebody took with a camera. And Elizabeth and I are sitting there watching it because, you know, she thinks it's like really cool, and next thing I know I'm kind of falling asleep. And then I start getting really into it too, just watching everything that this person videotaped. And then all of a sudden, it didn't feel like too much longer but I realized it was three hours later, and the whole party was over and my mother was back to get us and find out what happened to us. And I was so mad that my mother didn't come and get us sooner, that she was in the car taking me home, I was screaming and yelling and whipping my purse out the window and like, \"Why wouldn't you come and get us? You made me miss the party!\" And I was so resentful that Elizabeth sat there, bored as anything, but she was watching that movie that I thought she thought was interesting and we missed all the rest of the goings-on that day. And so I don't know what that means, but that was kind of dumb."

It might have been set off by Dracula or it might have been set off by being with Sandra and Lee who are Christians. I don't know what it was, but I dreamt there was this really awful like monster's den, but what it was is you would go down this river, and if the current would pull you the wrong way, you would get down this tributary that after a while, once you got down further and further, it would be, there would be more and more monsters trying to get at you. And they would all be surrounding you and they would all be moving in for the kill, and there was no way that you would survive that. And the worst part was, after you died, just like in Dracula, you would become undead and you would become one of them. And I had my little subdreams. I like dreamt that I was awake, and then when I wasn't like awake, I dreamt that I was like involved in that. And I would always like wake up every time and be like in the first level of dream before it would really be like not real. And I dreamt that I like read in the newspaper that there was one way to get out of that, that was to ask Jesus for forgiveness and suddenly you would just be out of that river and back like on some sidewalk. And I don't remember too much more. I know there was a lot more, but, of course, I put off putting this on here."
