            "content": "I was in the basement of another man's house. I don't know who this man was. I knew him in the dream, but I can't recall his identity. There was some sort of tunnel or shaft leading into the basement of the man's house, and there had been reports or something like that of some sort of creature coming out of this tunnel. I was arguing with the man that he should put up some sort of steel doors or steel building over the tunnel so nothing could get out of it that wasn't under our control. But he didn't seem to think that this was necessary or something to that effect. Then I left. I didn't want to be around in the evening when this creature or whatever it was, came out. But somehow there was some sort of business meeting that was called for that evening right down in that basement, and everyone had to come. I came and one or two other men came that were in this company, and I don't know what the business of the company was or anything. The other men became frightened and left as the evening went on. I left also because I thought this creature was bound to put in an appearance where it might kill and maim or something like that. So I left and the person who owned the house was frightened and didn't want to be left alone, but I sort of thought as I was leaving that I told him so, and so he better take the consequences for not doing what I told him. I went out and went to a parking lot and got into my car and was quite sure to lock the doors behind me as I got in the car. I was planning to drive out and I heard the man who owned the house screaming at this point. The man was about my age incidentally, or a few years older. So I went back to the house. I don' know whether I drove or whether I got out of the car again, hoping to rescue him or something. My recall is quite vague at this point. But I know I got there and there wasn't a creature there or anything like that. I then started talking to the man and interpreting the whole thing in which this tunnel leading down was the id and there was an ego and superego in there, so I was interpreting the whole experience he had or perhaps it was the dream itself, I'm not sure, in a strictly psychoanalytic framework."

Well, everyone knew about it and something had happened and some dogs, or at least one dog, had grown to twice their normal size and they might be vicious and they were running around loose. People should be careful to lock their doors to keep these dogs out. Then I went outside into the back yard to start a fire in the fireplace we had out in the back. I was working on getting it started and it was pretty dark outside. This double-size dog ran up to me, followed by one other dog who was more vicious than the first one. I tried to blow on the fire to make it come up brighter so they might be frightened away, but the fire didn't burn very brightly and the big dog came up and started talking to each other, and he also restrained the smaller dog from getting vicious or attacking me. I don't recall what it was we talked about. I think it was something about why he had grown so big or something."

The truck was a dump truck and it had all sorts of extra pedals that I didn't exactly know what to do with, but there were standard brake, clutch, and accelerator for driving in standard gears. There were several gadgets I worked which didn't seem to do anything. I drove carefully in driving it because it was so large. I seemed reasonably happy to have bought this truck at the time of the dream."

In the first fragment I was taking a group of several small boys, their ages probably running from 8 to 10, and probably being between 2 and 5 of them, on a hike. One of the boys is my brother-in-law who is about 10 years old. We were hiking through some mountains which seemed familiar to me in the dream, although I can't place the exact location now. We were hiking above what used to be a creek bed and I was explaining to the boys about how the lower stream bed and valleys had become filled in. I'm not sure what happened on this, whether rains had filled in the valleys with mud or whether some phenomena with glaciers had occurred, but anyway, up to a certain height all the stream beds and valleys were filled in, and I took the boys down this rather narrow little trail to show them this. This little trail had a concrete border along one edge and it was rather steep and I was giving them constant warnings to be careful as they walked along."

And apparently some sort of catastrophe happened to the well or something like that in which the lowlands and valleys were flooded and the water was still steadily rising. Then the next episode I was completely identified with a young girl -- young in the sense of being about my age. This girl was living in an apt. which were on some cliffs. I think these were the same cliffs as in the last episode. And several other people were also staying there. The temp. was slowly getting warmer a well as the water level rising. The girl had an air conditioner in her apt. and she got into a fight or a verbal argument mainly with several of the other men who were living around in other apts. about what was going to happen to her air conditioner when she left or something like that because she told them  about some kinds of plans about going north in a couple of days, although she -- and I use \"she\" rather than \"I,\" although I was completely identified with her -- was thinking that at the time of the dream that perhaps she was just lying to these men to put them off. She was afraid they might take her air conditioner. She also had some other kind of gadget which she was afraid they would take. This particular dream episode was very similar to science fiction stories which I read, one yesterday and one about four or five days ago."

            "content": "I went out to a used car dealer who handled, I think, Studebakers and Volkswagens, a new car dealer who also had used cars. I kept thinking in the dream that I wanted to buy a used VW even though every once in a while I would realize that was not what I wanted to do. I wanted to get a 1960 compact or something like that. I went ahead and got a trade-in estimate on my car of about $795, which seems rather high now that I think of it. Then somehow I went ahead and paid the man what money I had with me to make up the difference on another car. Then I realized that was sort of stupid to go ahead and do then because I wasn't even sure that he would have the kind of car I wanted. But then I started looking at his used cars an he showed me a full-size 1960 car, 59 or 60 car, 4-door with an automatic transmission. Then he showed me a Willys and another car whose name I can't recall, except it was a very odd one. Both this car and the Willys were very strange because they looked very old-fashioned. They were open and like a surrey with a fringe on top. About at this point I started talking with my wife about a car that we needed. We were in my hometown at the time at my mother's home, although I don't think she's there, which is strange because we expect to buy this car in my wife's hometown at my wife's parents' home. We thought that we really wanted to look around some more to get a better idea, but we really didn't have time since we had to go home in a couple of days. So we'd probably go ahead and buy one off this car dealer's lot anyway."

            "content": "It started out with my being in my father-in-law's office. My father-in-law is a man in his forties, was talking to his secretary, a woman who I don't know. She's somewhere around 30. And I believe he's also telephoning somewhere in this juncture and I wasn't paying too much attention to what they said. I'm not sure what I was doing in the office as far as that goes. And he finished his telephone conversation, and eventually his secretary went home for the day. then he and I got into an argument with him being rather mad at me because I hadn't been listening to what he had been talking about with his secretary. He had been talking with her something about his steady girlfriends. I argued back at him that I thought they were talking something about the business that I neither understood or anything like that, so I just hadn't paid much attention to them. He went on to argue that he didn't have a whole bunch of steady girlfriends, but everybody had to have a few that they could go out with every once in a while. I got the impression in the dream that he didn't mean to go to sleep with them, but to go out nightclubbing with them every once in a while or something to that effect. He and I then left. We went down an elevator, somewhere between 8 and 4 stories down and got off and went out of the building. I believe we were going to go back to his home in my wife's hometown, but when we got outside the building and closed the door, for some reason he wanted to go back in the building again up to his office. But the door we just came out of was locked. So we went around to the rear of the building and there was a drop of 8 or 9 feet into a lower level where there was some construction going on right behind the building. we both jumped over the fence, holding on and then letting go and dropping down. There was a board fence too, right along the edge where we dropped down, and I followed him over the slightly muddy ground and we went in a back door. Then what happens here is somewhat confused. But we started up on the elevator and there were some confusing things I don't recall exactly of getting on and off the elevator several times, and the elevator not exactly lining up with the floor levels at which it stopped and some things of this nature. But then what happened was that I got off the elevator following my sister-in-law who is about 18. I don't know what happened to my father-in-law at this point. My sister-in-law and I were apparently making some sort of game about going up the stairs the rest of the way. I was following along a little ways behind her and she got well ahead of me and a little bit out of sight, and I became somewhat worried over this. I hurried up the stairs after her because I think at this point I began to have some fear that she committed suicide or something to that effect. So I ran upstairs and she and some other girl - and I don't know how this other girl got in the dream, except that she was some friend of my sister-in-law's and was about her age - had hung themselves. Some other people appeared again at this point. I think my father-in-law was back in here again and an unknown number of other people, and we got them down and started performing artificial respiration. I was giving my sister-in-law artificial respiration and there was a confusing thing here too about somebody said you had to take all her clothes off except her bra in order to give her artificial respiration, or perhaps somebody did it. I don't know, I'm not sure. I don't believe all her clothes were off when I was giving her artificial respiration. I gave her artificial respiration. At first I started out sitting in front of her and using part of the Holger-Nealson technique. I was just pushing on her back. I wasn't lifting her arms. Then somehow I switched over so I was sitting on her behind and pressing down on her chest and also lifting her arms from that position. A very strange way of giving artificial respiration now as I recall it, because in the proper Holger-Nealson method you sit in front of her head and lift her arms and push on her back. The older technique is just to sit on the person's behind and push on their back. Anyway, I gave her artificial respiration, and she finally revived. I was quite worried at that point in the dream and I was crying because I was afraid she was going to die, and when she finally revived, I thanked God that she came back to life again, and I hoped that there hadn't been any brain damage or anything like that. I didn't think there had. She recovered and her friend also recovered and didn't seem any the worse for it. Then I don't remember if there were any intervening events. We were in my parents-in-law's home in my wife's hometown. There was some sort of discussion going on and I was saying how I would watch Bonnie very carefully. Bonnie is my sister-in-law. I would watch her carefully so she didn't attempt anything like that again. I was thinking in the dream too of how I had talked to Bonnie a year or so ago about an attempt on her part once to commit suicide. I asked her to promise not to do anything like that again without talking to me first. I was rather disappointed that this hadn't happened in the sense that she hadn't talked to me instead of trying something like this. The discussion became a little bit more confused now, in that somehow my brother-in-law, who is about 9 or 10 years old, had also tried to commit suicide somehow. I was supposed to be watching him in some way. He wanted to go up to a little soda shop a few blocks away, and I was thinking and discussing how I would watch him while he was there to make sure he didn't get near any displays that might be put to dangerous use, such as a place where there was some hardware and some nails. This was about the end of the dream. The emotional mood was quite unpleasant. The argument with my father-in-law was unpleasant. The grief I felt over the potential suicide was quite intense in the dream. I was quite actively involved in it."

            "content": "My wife and I and a number of other people are at some kind of party and there is another woman there who may be acting as the hostess, I'm not sure. I've been drinking some sort of wine throughout most of the evening and then she gives me some tequila or something like that to drink. As a result of drinking this, something happens to my mind, so that I'm now very stupid. I realize that this has happened once before and it takes months to wear off, and so I become quite angry at this woman. I have thoughts of getting back at her somehow and then this shades over into some other part of a dream in which I have been at a concert or athletic event in a big stadium. I go down to the ticket office afterwards. It seems that the music they played at the end of the event has made me a little bit deaf, dumb again. I go down to the ticket office to complain about this. I give them some kind of brown paper envelope. Then there's a somewhat confused series of events in which the envelope apparently is full of tickets which the ticket people have not actually sold. But somehow they worked out some kind of deal where they could get some money and have some tickets left over, and they just had to get rid of the tickets, and they mentioned something about having to throw the tickets out every once in a while. This shades over into a part of the dream where this envelope is full of money. I and several other people have robbed a bank or somehow gotten this money illegally. We're running away. We run into a Catholic church which I ha  dreamed about before. I don't recall if I've ever been in one like it in real life, but I've dreamed about this particular church. We are hiding in this church. A priest comes in for a while, and a janitor and some cleaning women, and we're sneaking around trying to make sure we're not noticed by these people. Finally, one or two cleaning women notice us, and one of the people with me who robbed this bank or whatever we did to get the money, is a woman, and she offers to bribe them. First she offers them five dollars if she'll forget they've seen us, then $10, then she offers them $100 each right then and another $100 tomorrow. I argue with her that that will call a lot of suspicion to us because she is giving them such a big amount. Then I don't recall what happened immediately after that, but it shifts over to a scene in which I have the envelope with the money in it. I'm running away from everybody else. I don't know what happened to the people that were involved in getting the money with me, but there are some other crooks trying to get the money away from me. I'm up in a big balcony in this church and they're down below. I don't think they know where I am, but one person is coming up the stairs. The balcony is made of canvas as I recall, and it's a little bit unstable. It's made of canvas and it's unstable; it's green canvas. There's another one right below it also made of canvas. These other people who are after me start driving their car up into the lower one, and I don't think it will hold, but it does. It shakes quite a bit, but they drive their car up into the first one to the far end where a ramp up to the second one is, where I am. They start driving up that. For some reason they don't drive up to the second one after all, even though they started. One man is coming up onto the 2nd balcony. I have a hypodermic syringe in my hand filled with sodium amatol or sodium pentothal, one of the barbiturates that's rather quick-acting. I think that when the man gets up there, I'll plunge it in where I think there's a vein and inject it very quickly and knock him out that way. I have some doubts as to whether this will be quick enough, but apparently I don't have any other choice. So the man's head comes up the stairway, I quickly inject it and he doesn't struggle much, and I manage to inject it. A few seconds later he falls over and is passed out. Again, following this, there are a few intermediate events which I don't recall. Then I'm on the run with this envelope full of money and there's a woman with me, about my own age. I don't know who she is, but I know she is involved with me in stealing from the crooks. The crooks are after us. She and I have apparently planned to steal this money for quite a while in advance. We've set up some kind of sunbathing club or something like that. We come to this very tall brick building, almost windowless, and it is part of this sunbathing club we've set up. We climb right up the vertical wall of the building. There are some little cracks left in the bricks, apparently purposely, and we climb up onto the roof, open the trap door which reveals two chutes, side by side, going down about 8 or 9 feet into a little hidden room inside there. There are a few people scattered here and there on the roof sunbathing and I hope that they won't see us. So we slide down into the room and close the trap doors above us after us. This is a temporary hideaway and we plan to go on from here and get away even further. but the woman decides we should stay there, that we're really quite safe there, and no one would ever find us. I tell her no, that some people have probably seen us going in from the roof and we have to go on. It's part of the plan. We have a little argument about it. Finally I decide to go on, and she's going to stay there. I give her half of the money and I also have a thought that in a way it's somewhat better that we're splitting up. It increases my chances of getting away. It also seems to have her going along with me. So I leave the room. I don't' recall what happened immediately after that, but I think the crooks cornered me again eventually and I was under another balcony. No, I'm not sure. There was a scene in there somewhere where I was under a canvas balcony and they were shooting with a machine gun through the canvas, and I was moving around so as not to be under the same part of the balcony. But that may have gone back to the previous scene where the balcony was. I'm not sure."

            "content": "I recall one dream this morning. I'm out in the country standing in a field looking at this old rickety barn. For some reason I want to get in this barn. The doors are locked. So I decide I'll get in through one of the second story windows. I climb up on the porch and get up onto the roof and carefully work my way over to the edge. I'm about to lower myself over the edge and swing into the second story window when I find there's a man on the roof beside me. He is a person who works in this barn. He's a foreman or something like that. He asked me what I was doing there. I tell him that I just wanted to get in and I was going to swing in this window. He tells me that I don't need to do anything that dangerous because there's a trap door right beside him that he came up through. So we go down through the trap door into the 2nd story of this barn. It's a very large 2nd story and the barn is full of fascinating objects, pieces of electronics equipment and machine tools, and the sort of things you find in the loft of a real old barn. I'm quite delighted with the place. At this point I have a friend with me. I don't know where the friend came from, but he's there. Somebody about my age. I don't know exactly who he is. He is looking around and is fascinated too. One of the things that I notice in particular is that there's an excellent machine shop up here in the barn that this man runs. I spend a little time looking at this big lathe. My friend and I are wandering around looking at the various things. There are a number of partitions in the barn loft and we're behind one of those when the woman who owns the barn and the farm comes upstairs. I'm not sure if she approved of our being there or not, so I hide behind this partition and I motion to my friend to do the same. But it didn't do any good because the woman is walking over in our direction and eventually walks around the partition. Well, she doesn't quite walk around the partition, but she's going to. At this point I have an idea. My friend and I walk out and right up to her. I believe we introduce ourselves and tell her something to the effect that we were looking for her. What a wonderful old barn it is with all these fascinating things in it. I think we gave her the impression that we were going to write a story for the newspaper or something like that. She tells us to go ahead and take any pictures if we want them. This woman is dressed in a rather old-fashioned way. I think she's in her 30's or 40's, something like that, with a very long skirt. She asked if we don't want to take her picture, but she seems to want us to, so I figure we will. She shows us a little bucket that was used for bathing. She says she'll get in it and take a bath for us to take a picture. I'm somewhat amazed because this bucket looks like it's only an ordinary galvanized pail really. I don't see how in the world she could possibly get in there and take a bath. She takes her clothes off. At this point she looks younger and nicely shaped. She looks like she's in her 20's at this point. Sure enough, she sits down in the bucket and she fits just about completely in this bucket with just her head and legs sticking out. It's not as if the bucket has enlarged or she's particularly shrunk, but somehow she just fits. So I put a flashbulb in this camera I'm carrying. It's a funny camera because there's no reflector for the flash. The bulb just goes in a socket on top of the camera. I snap a picture, but the flash bulb doesn't go off, so I figure that picture is ruined. I look around for a second flash bulb and I think how I might be able to test the second flash bulb to make sure it's good. I wonder if the battery in the camera is bad or if the flash bulb itself is bad and think about how to check it with no meter."

The last one in this series is what I dreamed about just before awakening. It went like so. My wife and I were staying in a cabin in the woods somewhere. Sartog, this evil beetle, was there with us. I think that I had finally conquered him in the venture before this and I was keeping him around just to save him, or something like that, for old times sake. One morning I woke up in bed and my wife was smoking and this upset me very much. I sort of attributed it partly to Sartog's influence. So for the rest of the day I sort of alternated between looking around for Sartog, although I really wasn't blaming him entirely, and being as nasty as I could to my wife. Sartog also had grown by this time too and was now a little baby girl, like my daughter, about a year old or something like that. The predominant mood of this dream was quite unpleasant. I was both unhappy and being extremely nasty. One other incident in this dream, between being nasty, I was trying to cook my own breakfast. I think I was cooking oatmeal in a very big pot on the stove. I was having some difficulty in cooking it. Thinking I needed the help of a high school physics teacher or something like that, who would probably know something about cooking."

            "content": "The dream centered around an unusual building. It was a yellow brick building that had a large round tower on its as well as a number of very long corridors around ground level. In one scene I recall from this dream, the building belonged to me. I was getting away from some people, not that I was afraid or anything, but that I was sort of joking with them and showing them they couldn't bother me. I ran into this building and thru some corridors and I closed some heavy iron doors behind me. One of the interesting things here is that I never actually saw the iron doors in my dream, but I pictured them. They were doors that I have thought about in the past as perhaps being effective for a bomb shelter or something like that. Big flat sheets of steel that would just drop down at the flick of a switch and block a passageway. So I sort of imagined closing several of these doors and ran up into the tower. The next scene I remember, which is still in this building, involves me being up in the tower and I'm trying to get away from some woman, about my own age, apparently because I don't want to get romantically involved with her. So I'm up in the tower and I start down in a small escalator. It's a peculiar escalator because you sit in it and the sides touch you. I ride this down a few feet and stop it. I don't exactly stop the escalator because it keeps moving, but I stay in the same position by moving up a step or just having detached a part of the escalator. There's some slot machines there. I take this one slot machine and I find a dime lying beside it and start playing it. I win and play it several times. I keep getting enough money each time to keep right on playing. Then I realize that this woman has come up into the top of the tower looking for me. So I start going down the escalator a fast as I can. I believe she starts coming down after me. Another scene I recall is that I am with some girl about my own age and we decide to run off together somewhere and have intercourse. We start running off through this same yellow brick building thru these corridors and we know we're being chased by some kind of robot or mechanical gadget that is specifically designed to prevent people from running off and making love. So we run very quickly because we know the robot can't go very fast. We put some distance between us and it. I never actually see this robot incidentally. Again it's sort of conceptualized in the dream like the iron doors were. We run around the corridor and jump thru some swinging doors into a room in the basement that's full of pipes and such things, probably part of a boiler room. We figure that if we jump, we wouldn't leave any spoor, and we crawl back among the pipes to find some space. Now the space I actually see in the dream that we end up in the dream is pretty small and crowded with pipes, but again I imagine the space to be larger. This is sort of an attempt to change the dream to a more desirable form. We then sort of act as if the space were larger, when actually I'm not experiencing the space being any larger in the dream. The robot goes on past and I suppose we go on and have intercourse."

            "content": "I'm on a commercial airliner. I'm coming back from the West somewhere, probably Chicago or something like that. The plane lands in this small town that doesn't have a regular airport. Much to my surprise, it lands right in the middle of the main street of town. The town is vaguely familiar to me.  The plane lets off its passengers and then we starts taxiing down the street again, over a bridge and out onto the highway outside of town. The pilot is waiting for the road to be clear of cars so he can speed up and take off. He starts to once or twice, but cars appear and he has to stop. I worry in the dream that the wings will get caught in telephone poles and what-not along the side of the road. A couple of times it looks like they do, but it doesn't slow the plane down or anything. He taxis off down a side road since the highway seems to have a lot of traffic on it. There's still a fair amount of cars on the road. Then as we come around a bend, there's a big meadow there and there's 20 or 30 nuns having a picnic. There's some children running around. We taxi into this field or meadow and then right there is President Kennedy and a whole bunch of high government officials having a picnic also. So the pilot stops and apparently Pres. Kennedy and some of the others want to go for a short flight just as sort of a jaunt, as a part of their picnic. So the president and some Secret Service men and some cabinet men come on board. I and the other passengers have been told to sit back in the rear seats. The president and his party sit up front. The pilot takes off in the meadow. Then somehow I go to sleep or something like that and the next thing I know, I wake up and all the seats around me in the back of the plane are empty. The front of the plane is closed off by some sort of partition so I can't see what's going on up there. I realize that somehow all the other passengers and probably most of the presidential party have been murdered. Somehow I was overlooked because I was slouched down in my seat or something like that. So I look out onto the porch, this plane has a porch on the left side. There's no breeze blowing, even though we're flying along at a couple of hundred miles or so an hour and I think this is pretty strange in the dream. But I apparently looked at this porch in previous dreams and there hadn't been any breeze then, so I was used to it by now. So I just looked out on the porch; I didn't go out on it. Then I worked my way forward in the plane to where the partition runs across the plane. Right beyond the partition is the pilot's compartment. I know that the murderers are probably still in the pilot's compartment, so I look in some lockers along the side where I think the bodies of the Secret Service men might be to see if there are any weapons on them or anything. I find some things like hacksaws, keys, and chisels and things like that. Finally I find a revolver. I don't actually get a good look at the revolver, but I'm hunting so hard for one in the dream, I apparently think I have one. About this point, someone is coming out of the door from the pilot's compartment, but I put something thru the door so it can't be opened. Actually the time sequence is a little wrong here. Actually I put something thru the door before I start looking for a gun to give me more time. So now I have a gun and I believe I shoot thru the partly opened door, whoever is trying to force thru the door. Apparently this was one of the murderers. Then I forced my way into the pilot's compartment. I believe the pilot and one other person are still in there. The pilot must be in league with the murderers because he refuses to land the plane or anything. So I make the pilot and the other person get over in the corner. I try to call the airport on the radio and I finally get them. Apparently I'm going to have the problem now of landing the plane myself, which is quite a problem since I don't know how to fly a plane."

            "content": "I was flying in a plane back to the city where I go to graduate school. This was a very big airliner. In fact, it had 2 decks on it. Although I've never actually been on an airliner with 2 decks. I had a seat in the upper deck. Someone was sitting beside me on the plane, a young man about my own age. I don't know who he was. Apparently I knew him in the dream. He was going on the next trip with me after some sort of conference or something. He suggested to me that we share our hotel room since we were going to be there for several days. I had a picture in my mind of a big square terrace which was our hotel room. The floor seemed to be divided up into big rectangles. Anyway, he then went on and made some sort of statement to the effect that we would have a good time together if we shared the hotel room. I thought he was implying we would have some sort of homosexual affair, so I asked him if he meant that. He gave some vague noncommittal answer. I think I gave him some vague noncommittal answer back. Then I believe we had been sitting near the front of the upper deck and then some things happened I don't recall and we were sitting further back. Then the king of country came in thru the door  at the front of the deck and got involved in some rather petty quarrels with some of the people on the airplane. Apparently we were all his subjects. He made himself out to be something of an ass. And one of his ministers, prime minister or something, was watching thru the door, trying to tell him not to act that way. Finally he got the king out of there. Then this minister came in and made it known to us somehow that we were in pretty bad graces and that we'd better behave. None of us like the idea. I was particularly incensed at it since I don't think I felt I was a subject of this king or something. Then the incident that happened a little bit later. We started to come down for a landing somewhere. This prime minister, just to show us what would happen if we didn't behave, opened one of doors on the side of the cabin which dropped the pressure quite a few pounds which was quite unpleasant. Then he left the door ajar slightly to show us he could do it again, and we better be careful. I kind of wondered in the dream why the pressure didn't stay dropped since the door was open very slightly, but I quickly accepted the fact that it didn't. The prime minister was a fairly old man in his fifties or sixties, and he looked vaguely familiar, though I can't place him. He had a fairly light complexion, tall, partly bald. He reminds me of another grad student in psych. that I know only slightly, but it wasn't him. So then the plane finally landed. While it was landing, I called out to the prime minister that I was going to write a letter of complaint to the airlines because you just didn't treat passengers this way, and I would make it pretty hot for him and his kind and everybody Then the plane landed and we got out. Several people were running down to one of the entrances to get baggage apparently. I started to go down to the far entrance, then decided to go down the one they were running toward. This was a completely enclosed terminal incidentally. I believe I was looking around for one of the airline desks to start putting in my complaints."

Incidentally, his office in my dream doesn't look the way his office really looks.

            "content": "I'm moving out to California or out West somewhere. I'm getting ready to take my car and all my stuff and I'm starting for my mother's home in my hometown. I have a big tractor trailer truck into which I have driven my car and apparently packed a lot of stuff in it. But it seems it's not really decided that I'm going to drive the tractor trailer or not with my other stuff in it, even though it's packed that way, because this is a topic of debate as to whether I should do that or I should just drive out in my car. I sort of feel I should be able to get everything I need in my car. I drive the tractor trailer around in a circle. I'm worried about scraping several other cars and have trouble putting on the brakes in time. But somehow I don't scrape the cars after all. Part of the business with the tractor trailer truck may have been located in a gravel pit. Next I'm out in a parking lot somewhere watching 3 young boys about my own age that I'm particularly interested in, although I don't know why, except that it seems as if I am the future of 2 of these boys. I can't explain that any further. I go up to the 3 of them who are sitting in a little Renault and 2 of them disappear as I come to a point where they could see because they're not able to tell their own future. Then somehow 2 of the boys go down to look at another car and seem to become identified with the 3rd one somehow. In fact, throughout the rest of the dream I seem to shift back and forth between being a separate character who's the future of 2 of these boys and the third boy. Anyway, they go down to the other end of the parking lot to look at the car or something, and I decide to drive their Renault down to them as a favor. By the time I get there, they're not there any more. So I start driving around looking for them, and then realize that I've completely lost them. They'll probably wonder what happened to their car. I finally realize they've gone to a hotel in another car, and I decide to go after them. I park this car and go into the hotel and then some things happen that I don't recall clearly, which I believe leads to the following incident. I'm not sure. It involved me being in a railroad station waiting for a train. I'm standing in a waiting room reading a newspaper and I hear a train whistle or the sound of the engine or something. I figure it must be my train, so I rush out of the waiting room to get to the platform early so I'll be able to get a good seat on the train. Then I think as I'm doing it, \"This is the same sort of thing I do while waiting for a plane.  In that way it's a little bit silly, especially for a train, since there are so many seats on a train.\" Anyway, I rush out to the platform, but it turns out it's not my train after all. Actually I hear somebody on the radio give the time. I'm really a half hour early for the train at that point. So I go back to the train station. Now I think the train station turns back into the hotel situation again thru some action which I don't recall. But what happens next, I'm going back into the hotel to look for these three boys and I'm riding a bicycle. I ride in from the parking lot right into one of the corridors of the hotel and make a right turn and go up some stairs and go up to a couple of corridors which run side by side. One of these has a door closing it off now. I've seen these corridors in my last time in the hotel in the same dream. The other one has the door open, so I start down it, thinking I might get to the rooms that way, although it isn't the way we went before. There's a door at the end of it closing it off, and I find people are turning out the lights and closing their doors. Actually this is a suite of rooms rented by various businesses and the like and it's closing time for them. So I turn back and ride down the steps on my bicycle, right into the hotel, and eventually get to the room the boys are at. I have the feeling that while I'm doing this the boys may have just come into the hotel and may be going towards the room, and I'm hurrying, trying to get there before them. I find their room and go inside. I wonder how I'll appear to them. They may wonder why I went off with their car. Or they may not exactly recognize me. Somehow I pick up a rag or something and start to clean things around the room and wonder if I should pretend to be a worker in the hotel or whether they should recognize me. I think if I pretend to be a worker, they'll comment on my resemblance to my previous identity, but may not necessarily recognize me. As far as my identity goes at this point, I seem to have become a Walt Disney sort of a mouse. I seem to accept this quite naturally in the dream, although I don't think of these three boys as having become mice."

            "content": "I dreamed that I and my wife were at my wife's parents' home in her hometown. I was going to take some peyote and we had a peyote plant which looked like a big orange carrot. I ate the plant directly and was rather surprised it didn't taste nauseating. It tasted pretty much like a carrot. Then I waited for some sort of effect to take place. I started getting some images and the like and feel a little bit detached. At this point one of my aunts from my hometown, a woman in her late 40's, my Aunt Hillary, got into the act somehow because she seemed to be outside waiting for effects. I was laying in bed waiting for some effects. Then I thought I may have to go to the bathroom. There was a toilet right beside the bed and I got on the toilet to defecate. My aunt walked into the room about this time. I was slightly embarrassed, but she didn't seem to be, so I got over mine. Then she went out again. When I finished, I got back in bed, still waiting for some effects. Then the next thing I recall is that I'm laying in bed again and my wife and my sister-in-law are telling me that I really had a tremendous effect. My behavior was really unusual. I don't know what they're talking about because I don't remember a thing. It  seems as if I had some very strong peyote effects, but I was totally amnesic for the whole episode. I strained my memory trying to recall what had happened, and I  just couldn't recall a thing. It was quite incredulous. I wasn't sure whether they were pulling my leg. They showed me a note I had written during the height of the peyote experience. They showed me some psychological tests of some sort I had taken then and I began to believe them. I had apparently had this thing and had complete amnesia for it. The peyote effect seems to be over. I come back home to the city where I go to graduate school  to pick up something. I'm starting to come back to my wife's hometown. I had the stuff in our car. The car seems to be a confused cross between our old car and new car which we just got a few days ago. I meet a friend of mine, another psych grad student, who knows quite a bit about cars. Eventually he and I decide to trade our cars, with me giving him an extra $50. His car is a little red convertible, a foreign sports car. I'm having difficulty learning how to drive it because a number of controls they use I just can't figure out, including a strange sort of parking brake that only works while the car is in gear, not when the car is in neutral. One time while I'm driving, the car seems to shrink down. It seems I'm driving a child's toy. I don't know how this car business eventually turns out, but I end up back in my wife's hometown. I get there and I believe my wife and I talk a little bit more about my peyote experience. I'm apparently tired or something, as my wife wants me to go to bed. I'm wearing pajamas and robe at this point. I go into the bedroom where I've had peyote, where my sister-in-law, who is about 18, is taking a nap or sleeping in the bed where I was. My wife seems to think it's alright and I should crawl in beside her and take a nap. So I start getting into bed. My sister-in-law complains cause she doesn't want to wake and move over. But I tell her to move over and she says for me not to touch her. She's naked in bed. I climb in beside her and curl around her. She sort of twitches around a little bit, but eventually gets settled. I have the urge to say I'm still under the influence of peyote and I'm not responsible for what I do, but I know that's not so, so I don't say it. I don't recall what happens after that."

There's a man there already putting some coal in a wheelbarrow. He's shoveling it from a big pile. I think he's just loading wheelbarrows in general, so I start to put some in too. Then he tells me that wheelbarrow's for another customer. So I go ahead and fill up a wheelbarrow on my own. Then right after that I dream about seeing an airplane parked in the driveway right next to this coal company. It's a small, single-engine airplane. I climb in the cockpit and am looking a the controls. Then I recall an even earlier dream in which I am back at my high school along with a lot of other people who graduated from there. Those of us who were in the senior play and have graduated are putting on the senior play again. We had about a week's notice. There had been no rehearsals, and I hadn't even remembered to read over the script once more. We were putting on the play and many of us were having difficulty remembering our lines. At one point I lost my script and had to hunt around for it again so I'd know what my line would be. During the play I get talking about parapsychological phenomena with someone else who is in the play. This leads to a scene in the play where I and several other people, several of whom I think were in the play, but I can't remember who the rest were, were in a haunted house somewhere. We were going to spend the night there and see if we could see a ghost. We were thinking about how we would have a person placed at each door so if the ghost appeared and it was really a person, they couldn't get out of the room without being caught. Then we were painting the floor by the door with pressure-sensitive paint to which we would commute some electrons and some recording instruments so that anyone trying to walk thru the door would activate this stuff and we would have an objective record of somebody passing by, perhaps with an indication of the weight of whoever passed by. Then the next thing I recall is being at my mother's house along with my wife, and being in an argument about smoking. I was telling my mother why I didn't like my wife to smoke, and told her I had a standing arrangement with my wife that if she wanted to smoke, she had to do it not in my presence and meanwhile I would go out and get myself a mistress who didn't smoke. Then this led into the business of my going down to get a wheelbarrow full of coal. My wife was there too when I was arguing with my mother."

And 2 or 3 young men about my age who seem to be the leaders. And as we were going along, there seems to be some sort of demonstration of physics involved. There was a truck ahead of us with some people driving in it and it would swing back and forth with various objects rolling around inside and things like that, and it was demonstrating some sort of principles of physics or something. The whole trip seemed to be a camping trip. At one point we went off the paved road onto some concrete, or onto some dirt roads rather, and we left one truck. Then as I started going down with somebody in the last truck, I thought it would be a good idea to bring that last truck. So I got out and walked back a few hundred feet and got this last truck and started driving it along. Then the action kept going, but then the group was some sort of religious group, one of these minority groups that was going off to set up a new colony on its own or something to that effect. I and this older woman I know who is in her 60's, I believe -- I'll call her Mrs. C -- were the last two in the group. We were in this basement of a building which was some sort of hospital or something like that. We were going down some dirt tunnels into an old mine or cavern underneath the earth to set up our colony. Mrs. C. had to take a patient somewhere as if she were a nurse. So I waited for her. While I was waiting, I got to talking with this man who was very extraverted and loud-mouthed. Mrs. C. came back and we had a little trouble in breaking from this man and going on, but we went thru this wooden door into the tunnels. I heard this man lock it from the other side. I also locked it from the inside by putting a piece of wire thru a couple of metal eyes and twisting it together. I didn't think it was a terribly stury fastening, but it would give people the idea they shouldn't come down here. Then Mrs. C. and I went down into the tunnel. At first the tunnel was wide enough so that you could drive a truck or something, and then it became quite narrow and it was all dirt. Finally, we got down to a big cave and what we thought was way below the surface of the earth. The whole group was camped there and were going to make it its permanent home. There were some electric lights on. I was sort of curious in the dream as to where the source of electricity was. I thought perhaps there were some batteries being used now. Then we started wondering about the source of electricity in the dream. I think there were some plugs down there from the time there had been mining there, but they weren't connected anymore or something like that. I decided I would go along looking for plugs and just generally exploring. Right near the point where the tunnel came into this big room, which now seemed to have various wooden beams in it and becoming more like a big room in the house, although there was still dirt on the floor, I found a wooden shutter and I opened it and to my amazement I was looking out onto a garden beyond which I could see a stream. I was just amazed because I thought we were well under the surface of the earth. I called some others over to look at it and apparently what happened, we figured out, was that we had started up on top of a mountain and that the tunnel just led us inside a house in this town at the foot of the mountain rather than into a cavern beneath the earth. We wondered then if anyone else would come along in this house and throw us out of there. So I decided to explore further and I found another door just beyond this shutter or window opened to the garden, and I was in the hall of this house. I looked thru some doors and saw a bedroom, sitting room. Then I went out and found the front door. I opened it, trying to get a better idea of where we were, and the plate on the door said \"college apartments\" or something like that. I thought I heard somebody inside at this point. Not wanting to be discovered just yet, I went out the front door and closed it behind me and went around to where there were some other windows now opening on the outside of the place where our group was camped. The windows were big commercial display type windows as if this were a frozen custard stand on this part of the building. I saw our group inside and I didn't know how soon I would be able to get back inside. So I knocked on the window and asked the waiter if he could get me something to eat. I was quite hungry. He gave me something to eat and then this loud-mouthed man who had been in the earlier part of the dream appeared and started talking to me. He had his wife and children with him and he wanted something to eat. He thought this was a regular food stand and he ordered a hot dog and a pizza. The women who were inside the windows cooking for the rest of the group were flabbergasted. They didn't now how to make a pizza, but I indicated to them they ought to go ahead and do it so this man wouldn't get the idea that something strange was going on here."

Then I met my grandfather who actually has been dead for 10 years or more now, although I didn't realize this in the dream. He and I went on uptown to get something to eat. We went into several food stores and apparently my grandfather's idea of getting something to eat involved buying a loaf of bread and some raw hamburger or something like that. He was being very economical. He was always doing for his economical traits, to put it mildly, while he was alive. I wanted to go on and actually find a restaurant."

He was the supervisor of the prison. Part of the prison seemed to be devoted to mining as there were tunnels running off on the sides, and also manufacturing. We got back from our tour of the prison and some sort of disturbance started. We were still in the prison, but in some sort of main assembly or something like that. And this disturbance which had been started by the prisoners, the prisoners took over control. There were three prisoners out by this little booth where the guards were using some telephones at this time. Normally they use the phones to call other parts of the prison. Now the guards realized they were calling outside the prison, which was against the rules. The guards couldn't stop them because by now the prisoners had taken over. The prisoners made some remarks to whoever they called outside that their plan was a success and they had taken over. Now this person Harry was apparently in with the prisoners, as was also a man in the office of the service who seemed to be the overall head of the place, the warden or S.T. Then Harry and this other man were explaining to us how actually this wasn't a prison at all, but a hideout for criminals and a place where they manufactured things for profit. For instance, these prisoners went to town every night thru secret tunnels. The only person who was really locked up was a woman who accidentally had been sent there by the state authorities. They were manufacturing some sort of objects which they sold at high prices to criminals. I don't remember exactly what they were, but I think were very high powered engines for getaway cars or something like that. The plant had been turning in quite a substantial profit, but it seemed that they would have to give it up and go away for some reason. Then this warden person went up to the surface thru a side tunnel and hid behind some bushes. It seems he had some sort of quarrel with Harry or something like that. I came up from this side tunnel, which opened up beside a blue convertible. I saw him pointing the gun at me and I told him I wasn't Harry. I ran and hid in some other bushes and he let me go. Then Harry came up and the warden shot at Harry and Harry shot back, and Harry hid behind some other bushes. Eventually Harry started dashing across the ground toward this clump of bushes where I was, but the warden shot him in the meantime. Then the warden went off. Harry was planning to get into the blue convertible when he came up, and drive off. I went over to where Harry was and a woman came up from the tunnel and ran over to me. This was my wife now, although I think she was also with the inspection party before, but with a different identity or undefined identity. I thought perhaps Harry was dead, but he wasn't quite dead. He was in a minute or so after saying something to me. So I took his gun and went after the warden. I ran round to the back, but the warden was gone by this time."

There was a factory in back at the end of the yard. It didn't go with the house. There were a couple of garages that did go with the house. They had second stories that were filled with supplies and waste products from this factory. I thought it would be nice to have the garages. The man who owned the house went over and talked to the man who owned the factory, and he said they would have them torn down so they wouldn't interfere with the view. I didn't like the idea of losing the garages, but the man convinced me that they were so rickety that it wouldn't be a good idea to use them and they couldn't be moved in their present condition. So we went back into the house. The man showed me a copy of the form I would have to sign to buy it. I read it over. Then I handed it to my wife to read. It suddenly occurred to me as I was reading it over that whether it was a good buy or not, we couldn't possibly afford the purchase price of this house, which was $30,000. I said so to my wife and the man seemed disappointed, since it seemed before we were actually going to buy it. I became very firm about it. Actually we didn't have any money and where could we get $30,000? We couldn't pay more than $25 per month and at that rate it would take us 61 years to pay off the house. So we told the man we'd think about it, but we didn't think we'd be able to. We drove off looking at the address of the 2nd house we wanted to look at and hoping it was a smaller place. We really didn't need three bedrooms and things like that."

            "content": "My dream centered around a woman who was somewhat about my own age and looked something like my wife, although it wasn't her directly in the dream. She was in an apartment and was worried about her husband. She was afraid of her husband because she was afraid somebody was going to come and kill her or do something terrible to her. She wasn't sure whether that somebody was a stranger or her husband, because I don't know how else I got in there in which the husband tells her she has to make a trip abroad right away. The wife doesn't want him to go. She's in something of a quandary because she's afraid for him to go and afraid for him to stay. But he says he has to go because he has to spend some traveler's checks, although he only has a single $10 traveler's check. He goes. Then I get into the dream in my own identity somehow. I'm staying in the apartment with the woman to try and protect her. At this point there is no doubt that it's her husband who is going to try and get her. I am lying in bed with this woman naked and petting although we don't actually have intercourse. I become aware that a window has a piece of glass at a 45 degree angle so that anybody standing directly could keep track of her. Then apparently we hear noises or something because we get some pistols and look around to make sure no one is there. Then there was a some action I don't exactly remember. Then I'm outside and it's a house in the country now. She's apparently still up in the apartment on the third floor or higher. Some of the peasants or servants come running up. This is apparently quite an estate, although at times it reminded me of a house my aunt and uncle used to live in, in the country, which wasn't an estate by any means, and they used to live there by themselves. Anyway, the servants come running up to announce that their master is dead. They give me his body and his body seems to be a few pieces of soggy toast and rock and pebbles, all of which are in a brown paper bag. I decide I'm really going to have to make sure he's dead because he seemed to be such an evil person, he may be a vampire or something like that. I think that I'll get the servants to dig a grave and I'll bury him and put a stake thru his heart. Then I figure that might not be good enough because somebody might pull the stake out someday. So I decide to cremate him. I decide not to do it right there because there are some trees and the fire might start the trees on fire. I tell the servants to gather wood and follow me and I go around the back of the house and out in back of the garages and see what seems to be a cleared area in which I can start this fire. There were some benches there and a table and things like for holding a movie projector cause it now seems that movies are shown here every once in a while to kids. So I go around the front here and suddenly a kid sitting on a bench warns me that I'm falling into the lake and sure enough, this ground was I was going to build the fire on is actually very soggy mud that turns into this dark green water. I slip and fall into the lake and grab out for the hands of a couple of these kids so I won't slip in further. One of them gives me his hand, but my hand slips from it. The other one doesn't give me his hand, which I think shows some malice on his part because if he would have thought a little quicker, he could have. Then I have to swim out of it and somebody helped pull me out. I figure to go on looking for a place to start the cremation because I think the fire from the cremation will dry me out. I don't know what happened to my paper bag with the body in it at this time. I see another little cleared spot, a little further down. Then I notice this automobile sitting there and this automobile is being controlled by this evil dead man who doesn't want to be cremated. Even though there's no driver in the auto, it starts up and comes after me. I keep dodging behind trees so it can't get me and I throw a rock at the windshield, which cracks slightly, but it occurs to me that won't do any good because if there's nobody driving it, I can't blind him. Then I duck behind this big white Cadillac or limousine in order to avoid this car. This man in military uniform comes walking by, and he and I get into some sort of an argument, and I have the paper bag again because I hit this man in the head with it. He's wearing a red helmet and I hit him several times. Then a couple of American soldiers come up chasing this man also. It turns out that this man is Mussolini, and the setting seems to be in Italy now. Then the American soldiers and I try to figure out what each other is doing here. Then we talk and decide we're on parallel time tracks or that I'm a little bit in the future and have come back now or something like that. I convince them that they should let me have Mussolini because, according to history, he was killed by some partisans. So they decide to let me have him and I'm dragging him off and they're walking along beside me talking and our paths start to diverge. We start walking away at a slight angle to each other and all of a sudden we can't talk any more and the soldiers have turned into a couple of girls. The divergence keeps going on and they disappear. I'm hading back toward the place where the servants have gotten together the materials for a fire now, and I don't know whether I have Mussolini with me or just the bag. During the discussion with the soldiers, I think I pointed out that the bag contained the ashes of Mussolini since he had already been burnt."

            "content": "I was standing on some steps in a hall in a prison and I was a guard. This prison was in my hometown. Apparently I hadn't worked there very long or something. I was still learning a lot about the prison. There was some sort of disturbance in the cell blocks. I couldn't see the cell blocks from where I was, but I heard the alarm. Then this voice, sort of like a narrator somewhere, told about how disturbances were handled in this prison. Guards didn't use any guns, but 500 guards were ready for any disturbance. Sure enough, all these guards start coming up the stairs and going into the cell blocks. They all wore brown uniforms and they looked very tough and brutal. I was quite upset and sick at the thought of the violence that was going to take place. I could just imagine to myself these guards going in and really beating up the prisoners. This made me quite disgusted and I wanted to get out of there. All the guards finished filing into the cell block and closed the door behind them. Then four girls came up the stairs. These were all girls that looked like they were in their late teens. One of them seemed to be in charge of the other three, leading them up so they could register so they could become prisoners or something of that effect. They acted rather dopey as they came up the stairs. It took a long while for them to get up. The chair I was sitting in sort of blocked the stairs partly and they all had to squeeze by me. As the last one squeezed by me, she sort of flirted with me by rubbing against me as she went by. Then the three of them went into an office upstairs. In the next part of the dream I was now a prisoner. Another prisoner and I had planned to escape from this same prison. We hid inside a cell which we fixed so it wouldn't actually lock. Some guards and other prisoners went by. I then slipped out and went upstairs to the very top floor of the prison. There was a very large clock in this prison which could be seen from the outside with a very big pendulum on it. This other prisoner and I each got into the pendulum. The way we did it, there were two tubes running down each side of this pendulum and we each slipped down one of these and hid down at the bottom of the tube. Then we moved around a little bit so that the pendulum broke at the top so that the clock stopped working. Our plan was that someone would come in to fix it and take the pendulum out of the prison. Then we would come out of the pendulum and be escaped. A couple of old women came up and noticed that the pendulum was broken and called in a repair man. The repair man came up and noticed that the pendulum had to be taken out of the prison to be fixed and had it carried down several flights in preparation for taking it out. But some sort of complication ensued now so that it became doubtful that the pendulum would be taken out that night or even at all. Also the other prisoner who was escaping with me, although I couldn't see him from where I was hidden in the pendulum, it seemed that he died. I thought that I would be responsible for death and be accused of murder, although I didn't see why. If I was caught, I would be in prison for the rest of my life now. I get out of the pendulum and look around, and there are a lot of people milling around. They seem to be visitors who have come to look at the prison or some kind of convention, people who are going to stay overnight in the guest rooms or something like that. I don't recall too much of these scenes and persuade him to take it out right away in order to get it fixed. I was pretty desperate to escape then. Emotionally, I'm somewhat upset. I don't recall how it comes out."

I didn't recognize him at first, and he started telling me the rules of using the cabin, and something about how he left his credit cards in some town in Arizona or something to that effect. And finally I gold him to slow down a minute. I was trying to figure out who he was and wasn't he Mr. Peel. And he said, that's right, he was. And it seems that the Peels were friends of my wife's parents, and we were going to use their cabin down at the beach or someplace like that for a week or so. He was telling me about the rules for using it. So I finished talking to him and told my wife about the phone conversation. I think we were in our living room at home, but I'm not sure about that setting. Then I think there was some intervening action I don't recall. And then we were driving down to the cabin, and before we got to the cabin, we stopped at this automobile repair place - apparently the place where I bought our car, so I suppose that would put it in my wife's hometown - to get something checked, and they checked it and we drove back hill into this gravely parking lot, and I noticed that I had trouble stopping the car. The brakes didn't seem to work too well because, even with the brakes pressed on hard and the car in gear with the engine off and the parking brake on, it would still roll very slowly down hills and I had to keep making turns in order to keep from building up too much speed. On one of these, I just barely bumped into the fender of a little VW and caused a slight dent in it. Some day residue at this point which is quite appropriate. After visiting some friends last night, as I backed out of their drive, I hit a little metal rod that had a reflector on it and also last night I was worried whether my brake lights were working or not. Well, back to the dream. I took the car back into the shop and told them about my brakes and thought they'd better do something about them. And I recalled from when I bought the car that the brake linings need replacing not too soon or not too great a time from now. While my wife and I were waiting for the car to be fixed, some sort of incident occurred in which I found a cat or a whole bunch of cats, I'm not sure which, and was as if I had some sort of mysterious power over cats. But anyway, there was this one cat here that was friendly to me. Some day residue here. We were impressed by a black cat at these people we visited last night. Anyway, we kind of walked around waiting for the people who worked on the car, and we were on a street near the garage, and a woman went by who we almost -- well, we thought she was an elderly woman who is a friend of ours, a Mrs. C., but she just hurried by carrying stacks of envelopes in her arms. Then we were standing in front of the movie theater, and I, a couple of teenage boys and a girl who looked like hoods or juvenile delinquents, were on the streets, so we went into the lobby of the theater to avoid them, but they came in after us and were going to try to rob us. But I fought with them and managed to hit them and drive them off. Then somehow we had gotten our car back and were driving out of town. It seems as if we were in Poland or Checks. or some Iron Curtain country and we had to go thru customs. And also secretly, I was the Phantom, the comic strip character, and I was actually smuggling out all sorts of things. And this border guard gave us a very hard time. We were stopped on this bridge where the border inspection post was and the signs clearly pointed that this was the way out, the border guard pointed to a sign that said \"Trucks only thru this bridge,\" and I was arguing with him that he was just being obstreperous, ignoring all the other signs that we should go this way, and I knew that he was just acting on orders to delay us. And then I called another guard over and got him in the argument and was working on getting out that way."

In the first part of this trip we were climbing a small mountain, just Leonard and I were climbing it. George didn't want to climb because it was a very dangerous climb where one of us would have to grab onto some handholds and then the other person would have to climb over the person and grab on himself and so on, continuously climbing over each other in order to get up. I remember being at one place trying to get some handholds that were sturdy and not being able to for several minutes. I was slipping, but I finally grabbed on and Leonard climbed on up over me and then he was at the top, and I climbed up with him and we sat on the top of this mountain, which was a pretty sharp point with just a couple of places that we could straddle. We looked around over the lakes below and mountains off in the distance. Then we climbed back down, which seemed to take place very quickly. The three of us were sort of planning our trip, looking at some maps of the area. Leonard was showing us where we were now and where we would be going. I had some topographical maps of my own which I pulled out of my pocket, or rather out of my knapsack, and I was marking down where we were with some numbers to locate where our next designation would be. Just a comment here: these maps remind me very much of a map I looked at yesterday in a state park we were in. So I was kind of worried a little bit with George being on the trip because I thought he had never been canoeing before to speak of, and this was going to be a pretty rough trip. And I wasn't sure he would be able to take this continuous paddling all the time. Then with us actually starting on our trip, it seems that instead of getting into some canoes, we were on a platform and we got on a train that was our own train. My recall of things gets rather hazy at this point, but it seems we had gotten off the train again without having gone anywhere on it. The three of us went to the bathroom in the basement of this building, which seems to be a college building. Then we came back up and got on the train again. Then somehow there were some Chinese people, or somebody like Chiang Kai Shek or something, involved in the dream and maybe some spies or something, and I really don't recall just what happened."

She asked me to pick up some of the twigs and stuff that were lying on the ground to use as kindling that winter for our fire. I groaned a little bit for having to pick them up, but I did and carried them on and then tossed them on a woodpile in back of the house. Then I was out in front of the house again on the path leading up to it. It seems as though I had two or three young sons. By young I mean 7 or 10, something like that, years of age. One of them, standing part way up the path between me and the road, called to me that the one down by the road wanted my attention. I didn't pay attention at first, finally I got the impression it was fairly urgent, so I ran down to see what the son down by the road wanted. He showed me his leg or something like that and indicated that a little boy in school had hit him with his bicycle or something like that. This other little boy was our neighbor's child and he came riding up and I stopped him and asked what had been going on and told them they shouldn't play like that, and told my neighbor's boy he couldn't play with my boy for the rest of the day. So the neighbor's boy went on home next door. Now -- and I don't recall this part too clearly -- it seems as though my wife and I came out of the house or something like that, out to the middle of the big yard. Out on the side a ways from the house there was a very thick hedge and I became aware that there was something watching us thru the hedge. I went over there and going away was a robot that had been watching us. I didn't actually see the robot, but I decided in the dream that it was a robot and I was trying to picture it. I never actually saw it. Then in the next part of the dream, as I recall, I saw my next door neighbor walking into his back yard and I called to him. And I called to him quite a number of times. His first name was Tom and I don't' recall his last name, but I called him by his first name and his last name, and he ignored me completely. Finally, when I did manage to get his attention, he made some remarks as if I wasn't there. He made some comment on the weather or something. He went on in his back yard and I couldn't understand what was happening. So I went around to his front door and his wife was just coming outside, and I called to her. I asked her if she didn't know me, that I was her neighbor. She said she didn't know me at all. I became quite frustrated and quite puzzled and upset, and told her I was sorry I didn't know what was the matter and went back on to my house."

            "content": "My dream takes place in a big building which reminds me of the high school I went to. I'm taking somebody into court to sue them about something. I'm not sure what this something is, but it's a combination which shifts back and forth between something having to do with my car and something to do with my thesis data or something like that. The person I'm going to sue is apparently a friend of mine. His identity seems to shift back and forth between Dan Weld, a graduate student friend of mine about my age, and somebody else who I'm not sure who he is. While we're waiting for the trial, Dan and I or this other person -- I'll call him Lannie, although his identity isn't quite clear -- are going along upstairs in this building collecting grade reports or various letters from the teachers. We seem to pick these things up and put them in a little cart that runs along on a little wire up in the air, just a little thing, not more than a foot long at the most. This isn't too clear. Then Dan goes off for some reason, and I believe some friend of his keeps on with the job of picking up letters. In about 5 minutes I thought we had better go down because I thought the trial would be starting. So in a few minutes I go down to the courtroom, which is in the same building, and just as I reach the door, I hear the judge say something to the effect that since the plaintiff, that is me, didn't show up, that the whole thing was a mistrial. All these people come out of the door. Apparently all sorts of my friends were there. They were waiting to see this trial, and were disappointed I didn't show up. I'm both angry and disappointed because I had no idea that the trial was scheduled for earlier - for 9 in the morning, I think - I was coming around 9:30. So I wander around the halls with these various people, trying to find some of my friends or the judge or somebody to find out exactly what happened. I can't seem to find the judge. This theory gradually develops in my mind. I picked up an attitude from the various bits of information I gathered from these people milling around the halls, that my opponent in this case had planned this. He gave me the impression that the trial wasn't until later in the morning by working along with me upstairs. Meantime, a friend of his stayed there in the courtroom giving his side of the case, telling some lies about me, and filling up the time. Then he slipped away at the last minute while I was still collecting these grades, and went down to the courtroom and the judge declared it a mistrial since I hadn't shown up. I was going to go out of the building thru the front doors when I saw this guy who had taken up the time in court while I was upstairs. He admitted to be a fellow I had disliked in high school, and I have given him a rather vengeful glare and he laughed or said something. I called him a liar and I was kind of hoping he would get mad and want to fight or something, but he just went on by. So I went on out the building and I was looking for the judge's office. I looked around the buildings where I thought it was in the city where I go to graduate school , but I couldn't locate it, so I thought it was in the basement of the police station, or at least when I initially went to see him I had seen him in the basement of the police station. I went into the basement of the police station and just before I went in, there was a little box outside on the ground, a tall, thin box containing a bunch of rods, each of which at the top was a marker on indicating how some trial went. There was one there indicating that my case was a mistrial. So I went on in, and you were supposed to ask a policeman sitting at the desk there, or tell him your business or something, and there wasn't anyone there at the moment. So I waited a minute and then I knocked at another door leading on in the police station. Someone finally came, a policeman and a woman. The woman was apparently a secretary there or something like that, both of them somewhere between 20 and 30, I guess. I told them I wanted to see the judge, and they said he wasn't there right now. They weren't sure when he would be in. The woman turned out to be a friend of mine, but I can't think of who she was. I told them my theory about how I had been tricked into missing the trial. I believe that's the end of it. Another detail of it I recall was that this person in the courtroom who told all sorts of lies and things apparently talked about rapid eye movements and EEG stages and things like that too, said things about it which were just plain wrong. I thought that even though there were people in the audience who knew he was wrong, they couldn't testify or anything like that. At the end of the dream when I finish telling the girl and the policeman about my suspicions about how the trial came off, Dan came into the dream and I think I told him my suspicions. At this point, as Dan, he became differentiated from my opponent. He added something to the effect that some big cement factory or something like that across the river, during the trial, whistled several times."

The person who held me prisoner was sort of a war lord of this castle. There was someone else in my cell with me, a friend of mine, but I don't know who he was or what he looked like or anything. I can't recall that. We were seeking some way to escape and we knew we'd need help from the people who lived outside the castle. There were two groups of these people. One was a bunch of peasants who lived around and farmed, I guess. The other was a group of nomads, sort of Arabs, who lived in a little fortress of their own up on the next hill. But each of these groups was afraid of the war lord and his powers because of the fighting he had had. In our cell there was a bucket full of bottles of various kinds of pills. I found that some of these pills were tranquilizers and some were stimulants. So I conceived the idea that I could give the Arabs and the peasants stimulants and slip tranquilizers to the fighting men of the war lord and be able to defeat them about that way. While I thought of this scheme, somebody came around looking around for a particular kind of medicine, some agent of the war lord, and I went to the bucket and got what he wanted for him so he wouldn't notice the stimulants and tranquilizers in there. In the next part of the dream that I recall we, my friend and I in the cell, seem to have persuaded the peasants and the Arabs to fight against the war lord. We were on top of a cliff outside of the castle, not exactly a cliff, but a very steep hill made up of loose dirt, and we had gotten a lot of stones together at the top to hurl down on the war lord's armies when they come. I guess the stimulants and the tranquilizers had been distributed. The war lord's armies get into sight and some of them get below the cliff and we start to hurl rocks down on them, everything from large rocks to hands full of gravel. At one point I'm part way down the face of the hill throwing rocks and stuff down when I start slipping because the dirt is so loose.  I call for someone to toss me a rope down so I can get back up. I believe somebody does throw a rope or perhaps I only imagine it in my dream, but I don't quite catch it, so I slide on down to the bottom of the hill. Well, at this point, I imagine in the dream that I should have to fight to avoid being taken prisoner by the war lord's armies. So in my imagination I get a sword and cut down thru the war lord's armies. So in my imagination I get a sword and cut down thru the war lord's men and escape back up the cliff, but I don't exactly see these men. I see sort of a diagram that's got a bunch of points on it connected by a line. It reminds me of graphs I've been drawing lately for my thesis. So I cut out two of these points and this represents the fact that I've cut out two men in the army and then I climb back up the cliff at a different point where it's not quite so steep. We continue throwing rocks down, but the enemy army does get up to the top of the cliff at one point and here's where the Arabs come in. They race back and forth along the top of the cliff pushing off the enemy army in waves as they come up each time the Arabs race back and forth along the edge. I don't exactly see the Arabs racing on horses along the edge of the cliff. What I see in my dream is bookcases and piles of books along the edge of the cliff and I and some others are walking along pushing off books off the edge of the cliff. Some of my own books from my office are there. The enemy is trying to push these down, but they're big, heavy books and they don't push over easily. I think in the dream that the war lord's men will be surprised because they didn't think that we had such heavy books. Finally, the war lord's army is defeated. We apparently dropped stones on enough of them and pushed enough of them over so that most of his power is broken and we've won the battle. At this point I rejoin my comrade from the cell who was fighting on the other side of the hill where the peasants were. He shows me what he has captured. It seems that there was a shack alongside of the cliff and it was very tall and practically came up to where he was. Some of the war lord's men had gone in there to try and get up the cliff and it was a natural trap for them because they threw stones, oh, it must have been an open window or the upper part of the roof or something. I can't recall clearly now, but either they left a boat in there or they left a pile of weapons in there or something like that. So my friend had captured all of them now, all of these weapons or the boat or whatever it was. I believe there was a lake next to the shack so a boat would be appropriate. Then we were inside somewhere and I wanted to make a phone call. At this point I realized in the dream that I was an agent from earth and that this was another planet. I had accomplished a mission and I had to call in and report. So I picked up on old telephone and gave the operator the number. Something like 5217 or 5214, something like that, and told her to crank her ringer if she had to crank her ringer to get it. I thought about how this would actually put me in touch with a relay station, which via radio or something like that, would enable me to contact my superiors back on earth. I thought how cleverly disguised our relay station was so that even when the operator rang it would sound like an old-fashioned wheezy telephone bell."

            "content": "The dream starts out in my hometown. It seems as though I am acting as an agent of a friend of mine from high school, Tommy Darcy, who I haven't seen since I graduated from high school. He wants me to buy some sort of painting for him, a very valuable work of art. I go down to a nearby big city to buy this painting for him, and I don't recall whether I actually get it or not. But I'm going back to my hometown and somewhere in the process I've met this girl. I don't know who she is, but I seem to know her in the dream. She and I are going to go back to my hometown together. It seems there has been some kind of train strike or something that, while there are plenty of trains into the city that day, there's only room for 400 people or something like that going to my hometown. So we're going to have difficulty getting back. Finally I manage to get one seat on the train and she gets on the train with me and sits on my lap in the seat, having intercourse with me. I decide in the dream that something like this has to happen in private, so then it turns into the fact that I've got a private compartment on the train that has only one seat on it and I can just put my ticket thru a little slot in the door so the conductor doesn't have to open the door to get my ticket. Well, we're coming in close toward my hometown and for some reason the conductor does find out that we're having intercourse and so he calls out over the public address system that we're just about in my hometown and pages me to come see him in his compartment. I went in to see him, leaving this girl in my compartment. He tells me that I'll have to get off the train. We're really still several minutes' journey from my hometown on the train. So he makes me get off the train along with my suitcase, and some other conductor has also made the girl get off at this point. We're at this tiny little station which is barely more than a platform, just surrounded by fields and woods. The girl and I start out into the woods together, and we're being followed by a couple of plain clothes policemen or investigators of some sort who have some connection with the train. I want to go right into the woods and run to try and get away from them, but the girl wants to get a drink of water first. We run over to this big puddle, this hole in the ground with some mud and water in the bottom, and she puts her hand in and gets a bit of very muddy water to drink. I don't know if she actually drinks it or not. At this point the two investigators come running after us, but they fall down in the mud. So this is our opportunity to get away. So we run on up a hill out into the woods along a little path, and we get several minutes' lead on the investigators before they finally get out of the mud hole. I get the idea that I can divert the investigators because we come to a place where the path forks and we take the one that goes uphill, and as we get a little ways, I throw my suitcase down onto the lower path or I may just throw some clothes from my suitcase as though my suitcase opened accidentally. I don't know. And sure enough , it does work cause they go off on the lower path. We go on ours. Now there's an incident which I'm not sure whether it happened her or whether it happened after this dream. I think it happened after this dream, so I'm going to wait on it. So we go on into the woods and the path we're on peters out. We finally just go off into the woods itself. It becomes dark out and we don't know where we are, but finally we come to a strange little house in the woods. We go on inside and call out to find out if anyone is there. It's light inside and finally there's a little old woman there who looks rather pleasant, although I have thoughts in the dream that maybe she's a witch, and the whole situation kind of reminds me of Hansel and Gretel and the witch's cabin out in the woods. We ask her if we can stay thru the night since we're lost and she says we can. She shows us a bedroom which has a double bed and a couple of single beds in it. She looks at us and says we do do it, don't we, and we'll have to have the double bed. Both the girl and I are somewhat glad since we both would like to have intercourse again that night. The old woman offers us supper, and she's getting ready to prepare some and this big teenage boy comes up out of the basement and he's a guest of the old woman's son, or her ward, or her something. I'm not sure. He doesn't particularly like the girl and I being there. But then he wanders off again. I have to urinate in the dream and there's a toilet right in the room with the kitchen and I start walking toward it and the old woman says no, I should use the one in the basement. So I go down the steps into the basement, and I urinate in the bathroom down there. I think that this big teenage boy who seemed stupid in ways appeared again, but I don't remember what happened in the rest of this dream. This other incident which I guess occurred after this happened like so, or maybe it occurred before. But anyway, I was walking thru the streets of my hometown and I was at the corner of Front and Broad Streets and I looked down the street at the next cross street, which would be Front and Mercer St. I saw some men run across the intersection. First one man would run across, then another man, and there was a whole bunch of Negro men running along chasing too. I thought they must be chasing the first one. Then I went on down Front St. About half way down I met these two girls. I was going someplace definite and didn't want to be bothered with them, but they started flirting with me. Although there were two of them, only one of them seemed to matter here and the other eventually sort of faded out. She started flirting with me and wanted to go with me. I don't know why. I think she wanted to go to the same place I did. As she was flirting with me, hugging me, rubbing up against me, this truck raced by full of money and men who just robbed a bank. A few seconds later another one went by after it, and then some other cars and police cars in pursuit. They went off around the block and the girl and I went on up around the corner trying to see what would happen to them. We had found that both the trucks had crashed or had been caught up with and turned over. There were police around in plain clothes uniforms maybe guarding the money from the trucks and the like. We stood there looking at them, and the police in charge of the crowd were moving it back. They moved us both back some and then somehow it occurred to me that the girl looked like she was with me. She wouldn't get moved back quite so far, so I kept my arms around her, and next time they moved the crowd back, they let us stay a little further ahead. Then I think this did happen before the other dream. Then at this point we got involved in being on the train and going back to my hometown or something like that."

They had a new garage that I wanted to do something to. I had brought something along to fix up their garage or something. So I went in the old garage to look around for some screws or nails or something that I needed. The old garage was funny because when I opened the door I had to get down on my hands and knees to crawl thru a space that was only about four feet, which had sort of a cloth roof on top of it. I went in for a couple of feet that way in and then you were in the garage. My Uncle Edgar saw me going in and I told him I was looking for whatever it was I needed to help fix the new garage. He apparently thought it was a good idea. Then he and I were climbing around on the new garage which seemed to shift from being a garage to being a chicken coop or something like that throughout the rest of the dream. It was mechanically unsteady. It tended to shake a bit from side to side, and we were up on the roof noticing how much it shook. I suggested that we nail a couple of boards on diagonally to steady it. So we went inside the new garage and looked around for some boards and finally found a couple of long ones we could use. We also wanted to get some short ones for some reason, and we found a couple, but they were rough. So Edgar had this big power saw inside their garage and we used that to cut the board. We had to set it to the right aperture and everything. It was really an amazingly big saw. It was a big rectangular thing about 6 ft. long and a couple of ft. thick and 4 or 5 ft. high. There was somebody else in the dream at this point helping us saw - a young boy - I don't know what age or who he was or anything. From this point on several children and young boys gradually started taking part in the dream. The dream then got involved with us finding some gold in the garage. People getting greedy for it and all sorts of people being involved. Finally I gave away my gold just to cut down the confusion or the greed or something, although I had a little bit cached away somewhere."

            "content": "This other fellow and I were worrying that we're going to have our money stolen or something like that. This other fellow was a couple of years younger than me and reminded me of an old friend. We were outside a theater. The group that was going to take our money was headed by a mechanic named Edward S. We had invested in the film or in the theater or something like that, and during this special film that was going to be shown, this group headed by Edward was going to take our money. We didn't have any legal recourse so my friend and I drove out to the garage of Edward S. It turned out to be located in a big lot located on the outskirts of town and was sort of a combination garage and (something else). We drove in and sort of walked around the place looking at things and walked over to a phone booth there. I don't know if we were acting as if we were making a telephone call or actually made one. The only other person out there was this teenage boy who worked for Everett, and he became a little suspicious of what we were doing, even though we were trying to look innocent. He put in a telephone call to Everett S. Then I think my friend and I got into the gas station and took it over somehow. The teenage boy fled apparently, or was just gone. We were doing something we wanted to get done before Edward and his gang got back. I can't recall what it was we were doing. Finally Everett and his gang did get back. Everett was outside the window somewhere with sort of a ray gun in his hand. It was a gun that fired beams of coherent light, sort of a laser gun. One of his cohorts was down at the end of the lot with a much more powerful ray gun mounted on a tripod. We could easily keep from getting hit if we kept from getting in front of the window at certain angles. Then they would fire a shot in every once in a while and we would shoot our ray guns like they had. The nature of the place we were at seemed to change somewhat. It didn't seem to be a garage anymore, but rather to be some sort of a power station that generated a tremendous amount of power. It wasn't exactly electricity, but it was something similar to electricity generated. The fact that we had taken it over now had cut down the power available to the outside. Some of the power dripped off on the inside. It was sort of a brownish liquid and we caught it in a bucket and we used it to recharge our ray guns. At one point Everett S. came pretty close to the window and I managed to burn him several times on the face with my ray gun. Then it seems we had been trapped in this place for a very long time, something on the order of days or weeks. The rest of the world knew about our situation, but mainly were indifferent to us, even though we thought we were in the right. Finally, the dream seems taking place in England and these people in England were in a power station similar to ours, a group of men who represented the government or something like that, and they decided that a great injustice was being done us and we would eventually be killed if nobody helped us, and they were going to send an expedition over to help us. They sent out a busload of troops with ray guns or something like that. Then this vision disappeared and I was back in the gas station with Bobby again still defending ourselves. We noticed that power was now flowing into the station, and we hadn't been able to charge our ray guns too well lately because there wasn't enough power available. Now power was flowing in, but we didn't know that these people from England were sending us power while their expedition was on the way there, but we used it to recharge our ray guns. There was some sort of confusion outside which was being caused by the arrival of the expedition, but we didn't know this. But we thought we'd take advantage of the confusion to slip away and so we got out of the station and climbed into a sports car we found outside and drove away. We drove thru several blocks in the city and a couple of times we noticed a big bus behind us which part of me in the dream knew was the expedition from England, but the rest of me and Bobby and one other companion we picked up, I don't know how or who he was, thought it was Everett's gang coming after us, so we did the best to lose the bus behind us. We drove out to the airport and we got in line where they were loading or something like that and the stewardess was checking tickets. And we had tickets, which kind of surprised me. We must have bought them a long time ago in case there was any emergency. My two companions went thru the line and each of them paid the stewardess a dime for a little tray of food. I didn't care for the food that much to want to bother to get my wallet out and pay her, but she wanted to give it to me. Finally she gave me a tray of food and 15 cents change, even though I hadn't given her any money, with the insistence that I take it and eat it, so I did. She seemed European incidentally, this stewardess. My two comrades and I sat down at this table to eat this food, and we're all wearing uniforms, sort of like pilot uniforms, and I noticed that these uniforms were actually made of a substance that was both bullet proof and absorbed the rays from ray guns while protecting us. The buttons contained hidden ray guns and the cap did and the insignia did. So actually we were well armed, but nobody would know it unless we used the things."

I was wandering around looking at various things and not really finding any of them suitable. I had already tentatively thought I might get her some silverware. I put some of the silver in my pocket and I was kind of worried in the dream that I might be picked up for shoplifting, even though I didn't intend to steal it. So I sort of inconspicuously got the silver out of my pocket and dropped it back in the display tray. I went out of the store and got on my bicycle and went up the street and started peddling home. The route I took home involved traveling probably something like 10 miles or so to get home, and this is a route which I've never been on in my life, but which I've taken several times in my dream before. My bicycle is quite hard to pedal on parts of this road, especially where it was rather hilly and several parts of it were on major highways and I had to be careful because of the traffic. I realized in the dream I hadn't taken this route in a long while and I had to be careful to take the right turns and everything. I kept recognizing landmarks every once in a while along the highway, and thru the towns the highway passed thru, so I knew I was on the right route. I was still a good ways along when I woke up."

They had a big sign out which said for tonight any rooms which were on newly remodeled floors were free. You could have the room for as long as you wanted. So I thought it would be nice to have a room to sit down in for a while until it was time to go to the movie. So I went in at the desk and they assigned me one. I went over to the elevator, which I thought would have an operator, but which it turned out to be self-service and I went on up to the 9th floor where my room was. I got off at the 9th floor and started looking for my room and part of the hall I was looking in wasn't very well lit, and I couldn't read the room numbers too well. I was looking around for a light switch and couldn't find one, but finally a maid came along and showed me which room it was. I went on in. It was a nice looking room except the furniture was a little bit disorderly and the beds weren't made up very well. The maid and I talked for a minute or two. Then I thought I would like a girl with me, but I didn't say anything about it. Then the maid, whose age was undetermined, sometimes she looked in her 20's, other times in her 40's. Anyway, the maid sat down on the bed and laid down on it and I thought that was pretty flirtatious so I thought I'd see how I could make out with her. And I did and pretty soon we were in bed together. One other detail -- when I first met the maid coming down the hall and told her I was looking for a room, she had a key by which she turned the hall light on."

            "content": "It was sometime in the future, and there had been an atomic war and there weren't many people left. Nothing seemed to be particularly ravaged or wrecked by the war, though there had just been one. The few people who were left were being exterminated by the robots that they had made to do all sorts of things for them. There were a variety of robots. I don't exactly understand why they were killing people off, but they were. I and two other people -- both men -- had apparently just learned about the whole thing, the catastrophe and everything, and we weren't sure about survivors and all. This took place in some large city on the edge of the sea. We went into a building and we found three robots who were immobilized. This often happens with robots and you turn a little switch on and then they come to life. So these being journalism robots, we figured that they would know what was going on and would be able to tell us. So we activated them and then to our very surprise, they jumped on us and tried to kill us. We didn't have any weapons particularly, but we did get away from them. Now it seemed that we knew a little bit more than we did before because we knew we seemed to have to get away from this whole city because the robots were hunting down anybody they could find and were killing them. The only people who there were, were those who were hidden away in a few islands off the shore some miles, at least in this particular country which didn't seem to be American anyhow. We found a motorboat and set out for these islands. People who were especially rich often had private homes on these little islands, most of which were just chunks of rock jutting up from under the water, but some had homes carved out under these rocks and completely hidden. These people who were especially rich also had a sort of matter transmitters that are hooked up between their mansions and these vacation places of theirs so they could just step into this place in their mansion and they would be in their vacation cabins. We go to some of these rich people's houses as we go along looking for a place to go. It seems that perhaps we were being pursued by a couple of these robots which in this case looked more like gorillas or something. But we had one thing in our favor, which was that they couldn't use radar for some reason. This meant they couldn't follow you for very long. I guess actually it was more like radium they couldn't use so they couldn't get a whole bunch of them after a person at once. At any rate, we came to a little island which was just a big black rock jutting out of the water with a little edge right around it, sort of not very much of a ledge, but you could stand on another rock that sort of jutted up behind that. It was dark rock, very dark like lava. We all got off and sort of stood with our backs against this ledge. It seemed to be only a temporary stopping place. While we were standing there, two large sea turtles came in right where we were standing, where there was also a little bit of sand in among the rocks. They started laying eggs there, and this was the point for me to give some sort of zoological lecture about the survival of the fittest or something because we didn't have any food with us, so we were going to gobble up all of these eggs. I can't quite remember whether we stayed on this island or whether we went to another one. At any rate, I think we had first to fight off a couple of these robots which were following us. It seems perhaps we did go to another island which did have one or two houses on it. It seemed to be a fairly deserted island somewhat larger than the others, but with a few trees on it and a wider sandy beach. I went exploring around the island after we had been there a little while and found that it really was quite pleasant as these islands went, because beyond the rock and the beach that we had first been on, there were quite a few trees and a little grassy meadow. The whole island couldn't have been more than four or five acres. I walked down across the meadow and across this marshy place that I had discovered. In actuality we were very close to the city we escaped from to start with because I could see it very clearly. I could see a workman lounging in a doorway. This was a Negro worker and it wasn't a robot and I wondered how it was that the robots let him be around in the city. Then by swimming a little in shallow water and crossing another little island and then swimming again, you could be right at the city. I had this great urge to go over to it, so I did. Then I saw some robots coming, so I swam back and I didn't want them to realize how close our island was or that it was the one to which I was going, so I swam around it and thru this swampy marsh to make them think that I was going past it. As I swam, I was thinking to myself that I was swimming like a shark does, although the picture I had in my mind of it, the shark in the dream, wasn't very shark-like. It was more like a dolphin. It was strange because the water I am swimming thru has all kinds of what I was calling sharks in my dream swimming along close to me. So I swam right into the part of the island where we had started and I got out."

There was another stairway going down too. I had to give my sister-in-law to the king and she had been selected as fairest of all or something and she had to go first. So the time came and the king was on his throne and I had to go over and get Bonnie. Everyone was dressed in very royal type clothes. I had to get Bonnie, who was laying not exactly on a pedestal, but she was laying in a horizontal fashion in this, lying rather, and I picked her up and carried her over to the throne. The king by now had taken off his jacket and was wearing a white shirt and tie underneath, but it was still kind of fancy. He was sitting down on the back of the stairs and I had to lay Bonnie down on top of him. He then picked her up and went off to his private rooms with her while everybody cheered. I was kind of upset. I thought the whole thing was kind of barbaric. I sat down on these stairs below the stairs there that were the throne and was very upset and cried a little, I think. Then finally Bonnie was back and the king was on his throne again. I asked her how she was, then I asked her how she liked it, and she said she liked it very much. But she was a little dazed and confused and hardly knew what happened. My feelings were mixed between jealousy and gladness that she found sex enjoyable. She didn't look too much like Bonnie. She looked like my wife in many ways. I suggested something to her about going out of there or something like that, but I don't think she wanted to or it didn't matter to her, and that's about the end of it."

We were talking to Khrushchev and other Russian officials about world peace. Khrushchev spoke excellent English. We went back to the United States and made some reports and Khrushchev was due to come over for a conference with President Kennedy. I was telling Kennedy how Khrushchev spoke excellent English, and he was sort of disappointed because he spoke excellent Russian and he wanted a chance to speak it at the conference. I also told him that Khrushchev seemed to want peace, and yet he really wasn't doing anything to get peace, but rather engaging in military buildups and the like. Khrushchev and his party arrived and the meeting seemed to be held in a tavern or something like that. There were booths along the wall and tables and Khrushchev was sitting up at one end of the room and I was sitting down at the far end talking with Kennedy. Kennedy asked Khrushchev something about why he had pounded his shoe at the U.N. and Khrushchev obligingly took off his shoe and pounded it on the table and made some sort of reply which I don't recall. Kennedy then put on some sort of a robe. I guess that's the best description of it. It looked like it was made out of a thousand mops. It included some kind of headdress. It looked like some wild sort of Russian dressed in fur, but the fur looked more like mops and he went over to Khrushchev and put down five glasses on the floor, arranged in a square with one in the center. He had Khrushchev stand up on the last two glasses and told him to step over onto the other two, and Khrushchev stepped on the center glass, then on the other two. Then Kennedy stepped on two of the glasses, then right onto the other two without using the center one. He told Khrushchev that was the trouble with him; he wasn't very brave or something because he stepped on the center glass. By this time Khrushchev also seemed to have one of those mop-like robes on, in numerous colors incidentally, and then they started dancing around each other, then they grabbed each other and started wrestling. Finally I believe Kennedy got Khrushchev down and I and some of the other unknown people were thinking that this might be a good way to settle world peace. Let the two most important people fight it out here and now. Then Khrushchev was hurt and he was going to be flown back to Russia to get some medical attention. At this point in the dream there were some sudden shifts. It seems that now some sort of Russian pilot was hurt and had to be taken back to Russia, and I and some other people were driving him back in a car. Other people have already been driven back to Russia in other cars and I was sitting in the back while we were driving back to Russia, except now the setting was in my hometown and we were driving toward the countryside. Once again the dream suddenly changed so that now I was riding a bicycle along some back country roads. I'm not sure now, but I seem to be 14 or 15, something like that, and the place I was going to was a Boy Scout camp I went to as a youngster, and I was riding along on my bicycle and also trying to hitchhike cause I was holding out my thumb to cars passing by cause I knew that I had about 75 miles to go and it would take me a long time to ride there on my bicycle. I went thru some crossroads in a small town and the road seemed quite familiar here. As I went on beyond this, the road I was on turned into a dirt track. I knew I was lost because I had gotten off the road, so I turned back around and came on to some people on the road and asked them, I believe, where Route 54 went, and the people told me to just pedal along and I would see it on my right. So I got on it and kept going along it and I came to a place where the road split into the regular route and the scenic route and I took the scenic route. This was all very similar to places I have been to before actually. Now I came to a spot where a ferry went across the river and somehow I had driven my bicycle right up onto the ferry, and I have been on this ferry in a dream before, but I am certain there is nothing correspondent in reality anywhere. First I wanted to get off the ferry because I didn't have any fare, but it was too late as it was already starting out. The ferry got halfway across and stopped in midstream while the stewardess, a woman just like the airline stewardess, collected the fare from the passengers. When she came to me, I had taken my wallet out and I told her I didn't have a car and she said there wouldn't be any fare for me. I put my wallet back and I didn't seem to have much money anyway, except maybe for a couple of dollars. The ferry went on across the river and docked on the other side. I rode my bicycle down the ramp and started riding up out of the place and found I really wasn't on the road, but I was on a dirt track. Right directly to my left there was a woman pushing a baby stroller up another dirt road and that was really the right road out of the place as it turned out, but it was a very steep road and I wondered how many cars could get up it. It was extremely steep. I went on up and was pulling on my bicycle to bring it on up with me. There was a little boy ahead of me who started slipping some and fell back into me and I caught him and then he climbed on up. Then the last stretch of the road I was climbing up there was a mattress that was placed at a very high angle and I reached up and grabbed the top of it and pulled myself over. The bicycle seemed to have disappeared by now and as I pulled the mattress back, there was a machete in a sheath underneath the mattress, and I remember that I had hid that machete there the last time I had been there, a year or two ago. And it had my name on it, except my name was Leonard something or other. So I picked up my machete and I also had a sheath knife with me now, and climbed over a sill which was right in front of me now and into the office of this place and went over to the drinking fountain to get a drink of water. Somebody spread the rumor that the machete I was carrying belonged to somebody whose name started with an R and had been stolen. So somebody saw me with the machete and thought I had stolen it, but I told them that was ridiculous because my name was obviously on here. It wasn't the name of the person from whom the machete had been stolen. This is about all I recall. Quite a number of elements in this dream are related to things we did and talked about last night, including the route number 54. We were on a Route 55 last night. The costume of Khrushchev and Kennedy, the mop-like thing, we talked about someone who was dressed in a robe and turban-like affair and several other minor things like this."

It seems this is the second car I own and I don't know why I'm walking since I have the first car. The neighborhood is a Negro neighborhood and I'm walking past a house, a red brick house, where a prominent integration leader lives. And I do something -- run around the house or something like that. I'm worried about tough gangs in the neighborhood or something and I'm standing beside the house waiting to go on and I hear a Negro boy and girl talking about whether they should move in with each other, and she's joking about how she might already be pregnant. They go on and then I go on up the street to the garage that fixed my car. I'm a little bit earlier than when I was supposed to be there. They've had the car for about 10 days, fixing my thing on it, and I start talking to one of the mechanics about the bill, and it seems I left a little reading stand there with the car. It's made out of plywood, a very simple and crude thing, and it also had a padlock and a piece of chain on it, which I used to lock my bicycle. And he was considering trading this with me in lieu of charging me for fixing the car. When he looked at the bill, the bill was $10.80 or something and the stand wasn't anywhere near worth that. In fact, I estimated in the dream that the stand was only worth about a dollar and a half. The padlock added something to its value, so I was getting ready to offer him the stand and $5 to clear the bill when he said the stand and 75 cents would be alright, so I gave him a half dollar and a quarter. Then while we were going in to get my car, he was telling me about all these other things he had found wrong, but hadn't gone ahead and repaired yet, particularly the tubing to the brakes was not in order and showed signs of going bad. We looked around and he took me to what he thought was my car and it wasn't my car. Then there was a long sequence when we were looking all over the place trying to find my car and I couldn't remember exactly what it looked like myself cause I had only had it for a few days before I took it in for repair. And I got out my registration and looked at the license number and was trying to figure out by that. Eventually I found it. It was an old car, but it wasn't anywhere near as old as the first cars he showed me, and I figured he told me about the wrong car when he told mea bout all these repairs that we needed. So I got in and started driving away in this black car. I suspect by way of representation that the car represents my thesis and my thoughts on typing it."

In the last part of the dream I was up in this room in what seemed like an attic apartment, and my wife was with me, and this man about 18 or 19 years old who had been bothering us was there. And I was reading some sort of advertisement near the fire with a pair of scissors in my hand. He comes up and puts the needle from a hypodermic syringe in my hand. He's trying to get something against me legally and this was supposed to indicate that I was practicing medicine without a license or something like that cause I was standing there by the fire with this advertisement and scissors in my hand. And I immediately write down an account of exactly what he did and have my wife witness it. I write it with black crayon on the wall of the room, and when I write it down, I also have something in there about how this person wanted me to sell him a book and insisted on it when I didn't want to sell him one. This had some other sort of legal implications also."

I go back to the tavern, which is very much like a place in my hometown and I notice that they have a package store to sell liquor which doesn't jibe with having to bring our own, but nevertheless I go on in. I go to the bar and the waitress there remembers me and gives me the guitar and a bottle of gin that was ours and a bottle of brandy and a glass of beer that's half drunk. I take the stuff and go out in the car. I'm not sure whether the brandy is ours or not really, but there's just a tiny bit in the bottom, so I figure it doesn't make much difference anyway."

I'm ready to go home, but my mother wants me to try on some other shirts first. So we go into this special dept. where they have shirts and to get in to it you have to go thru a very narrow passageway, kind of a crawl thru. It takes quite a bit of twisting, crawling to get thru this narrow passageway. The salesman in this little room is a very obnoxious fellow. He keeps treating me like a child. He's trying to sell me more shirts and I get very impatient, but I don't need any shirts at all. The salesman insists on looking at my teeth and he has a bunch of dental apparatus around this little room where we are. I ask if he's a dental technician or a dentist and he says no, and I don't let him look at my teeth. He wants to look at my chest. This has something to do with fitting out a shirt to me properly. While he talking to my mother about it, I get just fed up and I just walk out of the room, rather I crawl back out thru this crazy twisting passageway. I got back into the regular dept. store when I can see into the little room because there is a very easy open passage into the rest of the store in addition to the very tortuous way we came in and I went out before. I watch my mother leave and go out onto the street. I figure that I'll give her a few minutes to cool off because she might be mad that I just walked out. Then I'll go pick her up. So I go around to my car which is parked out in back. It's not my present car, but a car I had several years ago, a little blue Isetta. I get in and start around the block for my mother. It's nighttime, but as I drive around, it gradually turns into daytime, and someone else is with me in the car. Someone, well, I seem to be about 14 or 15 years old now and I'm a Negro and there's another Negro boy about the same age besides me in the car. We drive thru some parking lots and come out alongside a gas station, but there's some street work going on and we can't go out directly onto the street. On the left side of the barrier cutting the street work off from the street are a bunch of Negroes and I believe one or two Negro policemen directing traffic. On the right side of the barrier are a couple of white policemen and quite a number of cars with mainly white people in them, each going around the barrier. I know if I drive to the left where the Negroes are, there won't be any problem, but if I drive to the right, the white policeman might give me a ticket. I figured, though, he didn't have any good legal reason to give me a ticket because of the way I came up there. How was I supposed to know that the road was going to be blocked? I did want to go to the right. So I drove on the right and a lot of people looked at us, but nothing happened and I pulled out into the traffic. Now the dream changes a lot. The car I was in seems to have disappeared entirely. I don't know what happened to my companion at this point either, but I'm walking down the street. I'm carrying something important, but I can't remember what was in this package. I'm also being hunted. To a certain extent I think it's the obnoxious salesman and my mother who are hunting me, but I'm not sure I identify them as such. Well, I duck thru a number of back streets and keep getting into poorer and poorer parts of the Negro district. The streets aren't paved any more and pretty soon I'm ducking between vacant lots and alleys and finally my companion is with me again and we're walking thru a woods at the edge of a highway. The woods are a bank running along the highway and suddenly they come to a steep drop quite a distance from this highway. There's a very tall tree growing there so my companion and I start to climb down the tree. There's a third person with us now who disappears late. I don't know where he came from, who he was or what he was doing there. We get down to the bottom of the tree, and my mother, who is also now a Negro, comes along the road and sees us. She's with someone else. It's not the obnoxious salesman. The situation now seems that I've run away from home for a justifiable reason. My mother has understood why and is now trying to make up. So she apologizes or something like that I don't remember exactly, and asks us to stay in this place. I don't know exactly. I can't describe this place, but the idea is that it's a normal home and we're going to stay overnight while my mother gets some transportation or something like that. Both my companion and I get in here and find we've been locked up into what amounts to separate cages. There's some action I don't remember. Then I manage to escape, and get out and attract the sympathy of a crowd of people. Then my jailer comes back up and while he's a little bit distracted, I sneak back and unlock my companion's cage. I come back outside again. I'm real tiny now, just a few inches high, while everyone else is normal size. The jailer tries to catch me and I run off trying to get outside where I can get lost. I seem to be watching myself from another point now and I turn into what looks like a tiny roll of film that keeps jumping along the floor and when my jailer grabs for it, he bumps it with his fingers, which knocks it off to the side and eventually it gets outside and it's lost. So I escaped."

            "content": "The main characters in this dream were myself, my father and a woman who alternated between being my mother and my wife and my little baby daughter. It seems we have all moved into this old house, a two-story house, and my parents' bedroom was going to be downstairs and my bedroom upstairs. For some reason or another, this house was vaguely familiar to us. We were kind of worried about snakes or something like that. So we were downstairs and I or my father, I forget which, used the bathroom for something, to get a drink of water from the sink or something like that. There was a drain in the floor. I made sure that when we left the bathroom, we closed this drain, turning a little sort of valve on top of it and also after leaving the bathroom to close the door very tightly. Then we decided to go on upstairs to my bedroom for a while. At first we were in sort of a living room off my bedroom. Then we decided to actually go into my bedroom itself. My mother and I went into my bedroom. I guess I should say my mother-wife here, and my mother-wife who was more my wife now, was naked and climbed into my bed and I climbed in beside her and we curled around each other. My father was still out in the living room and it seems we had some sort of a dog too, something like a black cocker spaniel, sort of like Blackie in the Blackie pictures. The dog went out into the hallway and came yelping back. My father hollered that there was a big snake out in the hall. So I jumped out of bed and got a 22 caliber pistol out of the drawer by the bed, and incidentally I do own such a pistol, and ran out into the hall and this very huge snake was at the bottom of the stairs. It was dark in the hallway. It was night outside. So before I ran over to the stairs, I fired one shot down the stairs, randomly, to sort of frighten this creature. Then I ran over to the stairway and the snake was there. Part of it was buried into a crack on the side of the stairs and the other half was out exposed on the stairs. I emptied the revolver into the snake. One shot misfired, so I got about 4 shots into the snake. Then I took one other live round I had in my pocket and loaded that into the revolver and shot that into the snake, which by now had backed out of the hole and was opening its mouth toward me. It was about the size of a big boa constrictor, and I hit the snake with all my shots, but it didn't seem to have any effect on it, to speak of. The last shot was kind of funny, in fact, because it fired sort of slowly. Well, I slammed the door then and ran back into the room. I told my mother-wife figure and my father to grab our baby daughter and climb out of the window because we had to get out of the house. We jumped out of the window onto the fire escape and started climbing down the ladder. The others were kind of panic-stricken. I hollered to them to come on. This was no time to get upset and to give me our baby daughter since I was the best climber, and I could hold her and get down the ladder. So they gave me our baby daughter and I started down the ladder, and they came after me, and somehow we were in a tree now rather than on the fire escape. Somebody hollered to stop and here was a teenage boy coming, or rather standing around the far side of the house, calling to this snake as if he were a dog, and this big boa constrictor had come out as if it were really friendly. Then there were whole bunches of college boys on the lawn running around this snake and seeming to think it was something like a gag. I thought the snake was really quite sinister, and I thought these college boys were being misled by this boy who called the snake out originally. He was quite evil in his intentions and we weren't going to come down out of the tree until the police came. This boy -- I don't know who he was -- he seemed to have some connection with the people we bought the house from, whoever they were. So we all yelled so we could attract the attention of neighbors and get the police there."

This cat and small dog are chasing each other around on this small sidewalk, and I'm sort of taking part in the game of controlling their movements by putting up detour signs where the sidewalk is incomplete, then taking them down later. I don't remember this too clearly, but at one point there seems to be a huge cat involved in here. A cat the size of a horse or something like that. I'm thinking that when the dog catches up to this cat and starts to bark, it will be quite a surprise. Then I finish this sidewalk and now somebody quite vague comes along and wants to take some bricks up out of the sidewalk and I don't want this to happen. I tell them to go away. Then another person comes along, a young man that I don't know. He's very persistent about trying to take some bricks. I keep making him put them back every time he tries to take one out of the sidewalk somewhere. My Aunt Hillary comes out and she tells him it's all right to take some bricks if he needs a few. Of course, since it's her sidewalk and her house, I can't say anything. I'm quite mad though. I walk around to the front of the house where there is a swing in the tree and sit in the swing, looking away from the sidewalk so I can't see the bricks being taken out. I'm really pouting in the dream, as if I were a 10-year-old kid. I'm just furious, but I'm not able to do anything about it, but swing hard. I make some caustic remarks about how there won't be any sidewalk left now. I look around and instead of taking just a few, this young man has a wheelbarrow full of bricks now. The sidewalk's just full of gaps and holes now. My Aunt Hillary is wondering if she was right in telling him to take what he wanted. Imp upset that the sidewalk is taken apart and I also have this \"I told you so\" attitude. Finally I look around once more and just about the entire sidewalk is gone and lots of mud where the sidewalk was."

            "content": "My dream starts out with me being in the back of a sedan being driven by some teenager I didn't know. Several other teenagers were in the car and we were in some kind of a race on a track speeding around, and I was reading something at the same time. There was a good reason that I was in this car, but I don't recall that part of the dream that had the reason in it. I was kind of worried by speeding around like this, but I finally decided that the boy driving seemed to be pretty good and he knew what he was doing and we weren't skidding around or anything, so I just let him go on. Then this part of the dream made a transition by an action I don't recall into a part where there had been a group of humanoid aliens living here on earth. They were indistinguishable from humans in their appearance and they had been found out or such like that, so they had to leave earth. It wasn't any good for them to stay here anymore. They were getting ready to leave and were in their spaceship, all except for one girl who was finishing a last minute inspection or closing up the ports or something like that. I apparently knew this girl from an earlier part of the dream and I went up to say goodbye to her, I think, so I started going into this open port where she was in order to say goodbye, and then the dream changed such that going into this port, I was sticking my penis into her vagina from a rear entry position and this surprised me in the dream, the sudden change, and apparently surprised the girl too, both quite pleasantly and so she rolled over into the conventional position and yet somehow she was still the spaceship in a way. So her rolling over so we could get into a normal front entry position upset everything in the spaceship. It turned people over and rolled loose objects around and everything. Also, my penis inside her vagina sort of symbolically, well actually, pushing around objects inside the spaceship somehow. Then I don't recall whether we stopped having intercourse or whether we went on and had intercourse. Then because she had done this and upset the take-off plans or something, she was locked out of the spaceship, but she didn't know this. The people inside the spaceship, who now acquired a mechanical machine-like aspect, were treating her as sort of expendable portion of the machine and she was going about her tasks of getting the spaceship ready for flight, then couldn't get back in because the ports were locked. The dream scene shifted now so that I was home or whatever home was. This wasn't clearly defined, but it was someplace also from where the spaceship was. I sort of learned that the girl was locked out of the spaceship, so I was going to try and get over there and rescue her because if she was left like she was when the spaceship took off, she would be killed. Then it seems as if I intend to fly over to where the spaceship is. The spaceship is near a fair ground, incidentally. Then there appears what seems to be a comical interlude because I see this little red airplane taking off. There are a couple of ducks in the cockpit, although they're both sitting behind the pilot's seat. The male duck is behind the female duck, who is his girlfriend. Actually they're more like woodpeckers, kind of looked like Woody Woodpecker and his girlfriend. They're starting to fly without the canopy down and he closes the canopy down, but he closes it on her beak, so he opens it again. And while they're going thru this nonsensical action, a hole appears further back in the fuselage and an Indian sticks his head up and this is the last I recall of this comic interlude. It seemed quite funny in the dream. Then I'm in this car that I was in earlier in the dream with this teenage boy and we're racing along to the fairgrounds in this car. My worries seem to have shifted because now we seem to be trying to rescue my sister-in-law rather than worrying about this girl from this spaceship, which is forgotten about completely at this point. So we turn off the paved road onto this little dirt road which leads onto the fairgrounds. After going a little ways on this, there's a little house on the right with a couple of minor buildings connected to it and we stop here and the driver and I go into the house. The driver has now turned into the county sheriff. We walk into one of the first rooms and this very tall, husky man whose head is somewhat bald is sitting there and we sort of know that this man has murdered all sorts of people. And so the sheriff tells him he's under arrest and I sort of watch these whole proceedings. And the guy doesn't seem to resist or anything like that, but he gets up and starts taking us and a number of undefined others, who have come with us, around the grounds there, showing us where he supposedly has graves of his victims. The sheriff has a pistol that he's ready to shoot the man with if he tries to escape, and I've got a piece of chain in one hand and some kind of scrap iron in the other that I intend to hit the guy with if he tries to escape. So he takes us around inside and outside showing us these graves that you can't actually tell from the surface whether he's killed anybody or not, and he is just calmly describing these things. And finally he does escape from us somehow and we're running around thru the buildings -- which now seem to consist not just of a house, but offices here and there and one place a garage -- trying to capture this guy. Finally I'm going thru one hall looking for him and there's sort of a reception desk there with a secretary there and I ask her has he been this way, and she says, \"Oh yes, he's right in the lab across the hall there.\" I go down there and he's working on some sort of chemical or electrical thing -- I didn't see that too well -- with a young female lab assistant assisting him, and he just seems mildly disturbed that I've come in. I have some scrap iron in the end of a stocking which I swing like a club and I hit him with it several times, trying to overpower him, but it doesn't seem to bother him at all. He's a big man and apparently a very tough man. Then somehow he seems to speed up time, which puts him at an advantage against me. He takes me prisoner somehow and I'm quite angry at this and also quite worried about my sister-in-law cause I don't know if he's killed her and buried her or if there's hope that she's still alive yet. Then I drop out of the dream scene and it changes such that it shows there's an upstairs part, the building that this laboratory is in -- which I haven't been to or any of the other search party either -- and there is my sister-in-law along with several other females that this man has kept prisoner. They're up on a second story and they can't get out, and they don't even know that we're searching for them, even though we've gone past outside. It's a foggy day and they couldn't see thru the windows that we were outside on the path."

            "content": "I and someone else whose identity I can't remember were in an apartment located in a skyscraper somewhere, but this was supposed to be a mountain cabin that my wife's folks owned. We were almost ready to leave ourselves after having been there for some time, but we were waiting for some friends of my wife's folks to come who were going to stay there a few days. We didn't really know these people that were coming, but finally they came and we welcomed them in and then the situation became rather awkward socially. We didn't know what to talk about or anything and apparently I and my companion were still going to stay there that night. We were all set up in one bedroom and we asked if they were chilly because if they were, we would light the fireplace, but they weren't. But somehow the fireplace got lit anyway and eventually we were popping popcorn, which popped very rapidly sometimes like a machine gun, over the fireplace. Then I'm going into the other room and I notice there were ashes and glowing coals on an upholstered chair near the fireplace that the others hadn't noticed. I was very quickly trying to get them off of there using a shovel before the upholstery was scorched. Then the next thing I remember about in the dream was my wife and my baby and I were driving down from the mountain cabin and we were just heading onto Rt. 226A, and this is a very step, winding road down the mountain. We were driving in our Fiat 600. I was having a little trouble going slowly enough. I was using the brakes; finally shifted down into second gear. That's an odd thing. The Fiat 600 has four gears, but had only three gears in this dream, forward gears that is. Shortly after getting onto this 226A, we were on a very sharp curve and came to a railroad track and I didn't see a train at first, although I heard a bell ringing somewhere and so the lights on either side of the track were faintly flashing, yellow lights. So I just started going right on thru and my wife told me to look out. I looked over to the left and here was a locomotive, a big diesel locomotive hauling a train. It was only about 10 feet off to the side and I thought it was too late to stop now. We'd never make it anyway. But as we got out onto the track, the train was practically hitting us, but at the last instant the train managed to slow down and we got off the tracks safely. I was kind of shaken up. We pulled into a gas station just a little ways over the tracks and somehow or another my wife and baby disappeared from the dream at this point. I was worried about someone from the railroad coming after me or something and thru some sort of action I don't recall, I ended up hiding behind the bottom of the door in the gas station while a young man drove up in a sedan. The door was a glass door with a wooden framework, which was why I was hiding behind the bottom piece of wood. The young man looked around the gas station a bit and there wasn't any attendant in sight. He finally started to come into the gas station itself and saw me. About this time also a small creature, something like an ant, appeared in the dream. I don't know whether the young man let him loose or not, but I jumped out from the door and was trying to kill this ant by slapping at it with a spring door spring. I was running all over the gas station trying to kill this ant and finally I did manage to kill it. It was night now and the young man drove off in his car, and I went and got into mine, which now turned out to be the Isetta which we had a number of years ago. Furthermore, the windshield was gone for some reason, but I had to get going as if I were being chased or something, and so I got in anyway and drove out onto the highway and switched on my headlights and was driving along down this curving road down the mountains, and in a few minutes it switched back to daylight again. One or two things happened that I don't recall, then my car had gone off a curve down a small drop onto a flat area. I wasn't injured and finally some cars stopped up above. The first who stopped threw down a long chain and several other sections of chain. The second car threw down a rope and a boy climbed down with the rope. I was afraid I might hit the boy with this heavy chain, but they didn't. So eventually some other people ended up down there and we were supposedly hauling my car back up on the road, but the only thing we were actually hauling was a big coil of BX cable and the chain seemed to be made of BX cable itself and it was being fastened onto this coil of BX cable down there by  means of the same screen door spring which I used in the gas station. Incidentally, by BX cable I mean the electrical cable which has the wound metal armor around it. I asked somebody who was up on top if it was all right to use the metal door spring as a fastener and they said it was. So eventually at least a couple of people were going to climb back up the cliff to get back to the road. I showed them it was easier to go around to the other side because there was an elevator over to the right, so we went over there and I hauled on the rope to bring the elevator down, a big industrial type elevator, and I was telling one person not to stand in the shaft like that or he could be crushed when the elevator came down. That's the end of the dream itself. This elevator had figured in earlier parts of my dream, which I don't recall very well. It had been the elevator in the apartment which was supposed to have been the cabin, for example."

The next interesting fragment which I think came at this point was that I was in some sort of cave and the whole world was going to be flooded in a few minutes. So in order to save myself, I took a big piece of plastic and threw it over me and about this time the water was starting to come into the cave and sort of formed a big air bubble around me. It really rushed in now and floated me up against the roof of the cave, and the water was about five stories high all over the surface of the earth. And I was hoping that the water would go down before air got bad inside this bubble. I could just feel it trying to take on funny odors, but then finally it started to go down and I was able to get out. The rest of my fragments concern adventures in the world after this flood when there were almost no survivors left. Several fragments dealt with trying to fix up a strong base so we would be secure. One of the things I was doing was bringing all sorts of bric-a-brac back to it. Some of these were things from the home of Bill R. cause he was going away for a year somewhere and he had given me some things like a very fancy shotgun inlaid with gold, intricately worked all over its barrel and an ancient saber and its sheath and I would take these things back to our base and leave them there and come back for more. Incidentally, at Bill R.'s, who I visited last night, I looked at a saber and a shotgun. Another fragment concerned with fortifying our base involved going into this big electronic distributing place that was run by General Electric or something and bringing back all sort of miscellaneous products. One of the things I got from this place was some kind of explosive which I was going to use to go blow some safe to get some money because people didn't realize that money was useless yet. They still wanted to be paid for things, the few that were left. Another thing involved in this series was, I think there was only one girl with us and we were trying to find some more.  I recall wanting to shift our headquarters, which we had at an old frame house now, into a place that would be more secure against attack cause we were worrying about gangs of bandits among the survivors."

I don't recall exactly which, and I suspect it may have switched in the dream. I don't remember all the incidents that were involved with this, but I do remember this incident which came at the end of this. In this my mother and father were driving into this neighborhood, somewhere in my hometown, although I've never actually seen this place, and so I think it was so my mother could look over the house of this person she might take as a second husband. We stopped in front of this house. It was a wooden frame house, white, and it had a lot of windows and porches, but the main feature I recall about it was on the right hand side was a very wide pair of steps leading down to the basement door, which was a big double door, and there was a tractor parked alongside that. There were some pretty extensive fields out in back of the house. I believe I pointed out to my mother that this probably meant that they did a lot of farming in order to try and discourage her about taking a second husband. My mother didn't like the looks of the house and she also noticed that the curtains seemed to be tacked back to the window frames so it would be kind of hard to get privacy. Then my father and I were out standing beside the road and we noticed a lot of logs and stuff, and we thought we would get some for our fireplace at home, even though we really don't have a fireplace at home. So we started picking up some small twigs and cracking off a lot of it and the way we cracked it off was there were some permanent cracks in the wood already and I took the thing you throw a rock over against the sharp end to pound on the wood till pieces of it fell off. We looked in the back of the station wagon, which seemed to be upside down in some sort of way so that the wood would rattle around quite a bit when we turned it over to dry it off. We worked our way up the road a bit on this and then it turned out that we were at some kind of display of antiques because I noticed even among the wood all sorts of old bottles, old books and everything, and some of this wood merged into some bookshelves on which these antiques, which were for sale, were displayed. There was an old woman there who was the proprietor of it and we said hello to her, and went back to look at the antiques, back to where it was just plain old wood, and that's all that happened in this particular series of dream incidents."

I and some other people were led up to the rulers of mechanical equipment and junk, and each of us were assigned to a single row of this stuff and we had to repair this stuff. I had three or four things on my row that I had to repair. The first thing I had to repair was a vacuum tube that had come from the laboratory I had as a kid, and I knew it was damaged beyond repair, so I showed it was damaged beyond repair and threw it out. Somehow or another I cleared a couple of other things out very quickly so I could get on the main repair job, which was a jeep of some sort. The jeep was in a big hoist framework and I had to bring it down and bring it over and work on it. There was some sort of steam-operated engine that moved the hoist up and down. At first I pulled the lever the wrong way and pulled the jeep up higher, and I figured out how to work it the other way and brought it down and hauled it over till it was right by the horse.  Then it was kind of dark inside this shop. Originally this place had been outdoors, but it was inside a shop now. I think the shop was located in the basement of the house from the first episode. So I was trying to get enough light so I could see what I was doing and there were very few bulbs around the place. I tried to light a big fluorescent fixture, but that didn't work very well. I was talking to someone, I think a girl of some sort, telling her I was trying to get enough lights on to work on this jeep, but I don't remember that very well. Then I think I worked on the jeep for a while. I'm not sure. Eventually I heard a very faint knocking on the outside door. I went and peered out the windows that were in the door. These were overhead garage doors, although they were down, and I saw an old woman there. So I let her in and she looked very hungry. It seems that in the dream we were all quite hungry. She told me she used to own this house before the invaders had taken everything away from everyone. We asked her if she had any food cached away anywhere. She said yes she did. So she and I and someone else -- I don't recall who -- snuck into the rest of the house where there were lots of these invaders and we were trying to avoid them. Eventually we found some food. There was some more action, I think when the invaders discovered us."

When I get there I find that Paul G. and Don W. had to take the filing cabinet out of my office because the filing cabinet really belonged to someone else and that person wanted to use it. So my files for the most part have been put in cardboard boxes. Actually the filing cabinet is still there. It's just that the drawers have been taken up for the use of George T. including a whole series of paperback books and his shoes. Well, I'm wondering what I'm going to do for file space. There really isn't space enough in the office to get another thing in, but it seems in taking the filing cabinet out or rather appropriating it to somebody else's use, they've moved it over. Now, in fact, where the filing cabinet had always covered up a door, although in actuality it doesn't, and I open this door and find it leads to a small bathroom just off my office. Paul O. made some remark  about it being a very small bathroom, but it doesn't look too small to me. It had a busted window to the outside. But it's just a full-size bathtub, which is rather unusual. There are also some cabinets down at the end which makes me wonder if I couldn't file my things there. Then in the process of investigating this, I notice there's another door. This seems to be some sort of a service door. So I go thru this service door and find it leads into a small brick walled room which seems to have some electric wiring on the walls, and I figure it's something to do with the electrical service of the hospital. There's a double steel door, kind of a big electrical fuse box at the far end, and I opened that. There was another room beyond that and a whole series of tunnels and rooms. I think that it reminds me of the phase of tunnels and rooms that I dreamed about when I was a kid. So I go on thru these and one or two people come on with me. I don't recall exactly who. We walk up these tunnels and eventually these tunnels run into a series of underground rooms which I figure out are the kitchen or the cafeteria and we go on beyond that and these cafeteria rooms connect with several underground buildings on campus that I haven't been in before. So I'm quite intrigued with this whole thing. We start to go back and we go on past the kitchen. Then somehow we seem to miss the entrance to our tunnel. After a little more wandering, the dream has changed in this respect, that I seem to be a teenager now, and my companions -- one of whom is a boy and one of whom is a girl -- are also now teenagers, but I don't recognize them, even though I knew them in the dream. We keep trying to find the entrance to the tunnel and I keep saying we have gone much too far to the right. The tunnel lay in a straight line, but we came wandering around, and we go past a new high school they're building to replace the old high school in my hometown. Eventually we decide to go back and somebody notices there's a gap in the ground that runs very straight. We go over, but it's just a creek bed and we walk back along the side of the creek beds since it goes back in the direction we want to go. The boy went first, then the girl, and then me, and we run along thru the weeds alongside the creek bed and thru a brick and little stone wall. And then we're back at the head of the street. I don't recognize where I am, but somebody thinks they know where we are. We can see the place we originally came from. That is where we first found the tunnel, and there's a name given to it. I don't recall the name given to it, but it wasn't the same as it actually is, named Memorial Hospital. Then the dream seems to shift to the extent that I seem to be middle aged now and have found my way in my own home along with these friends of mine who also shifted to middle age. I go down to the basement of my home to see if there is a tunnel like this there. I go over to the corner and see what I expect to see, namely, an electric switch on the wall. Then in the dream I seem to think this is the way the other tunnel was found. I pull the electric switch out and then pull at a plate behind that, and this exposes a small access door, like they have for electric circuits. I open that and I can see into a bathroom beyond. This isn't as fancy a bathroom as the one in the hospital in the first part because they just have a toilet in it and no bathtub, and it seems to be partially unfinished as if the work ended without it being cleaned up, and a lot of dirt was left on the floor and everything. I'm very jealous about this tunnel now. It seems I'm going to explore this by myself and not let anybody else go with me, even though the others say now that we found this, we might as well call in some X-ray explorers to explore this thing since obviously it's very important. Then there's some sort of incident about a spider who keeps trying to bite me and if he does, maybe it's to keep me out of the tunnel. Then in the dream itself, I think I have some fantasies about how this tunnel is being used by some other kind of creatures to stay hidden from normal human sight, and that's the spider's way of keeping me out. I also have a fantasy in the dream about finding a little tunnel and finding some sort of creature there with a whip. This is supposed to keep people from going thru, but I go thru some kind of rigmarole that I'm an official inspector or something like that and get thru. Then in the next part of the dream I'm in a tunnel just like the original one, and I walk out into where it joins what I call the public service, the cafeteria kitchen and stuff like that. I thought I'd better take very careful note of where I stepped out because maybe it's very difficult to find on the way coming back and that's what happened to us the last time. So I take very careful note of it and then I go over the physics building and bring back some physicist -- I don't know who -- but he seems to be somebody in his 30's. And I also bring along his wife and two children. One of the kids is a little boy about 3; the other is a little girl about 4 or something like that. We bring them back and I come to the point where the tunnel begins. All you can see (there's trees all around it incidentally), is a white wire stretched across. I know now that this wire is some kind of a mind shield which keeps the tunnel from being noticed by unauthorized people and keeps them from getting into it. You have to have a certain attitude of mind in order to pass thru the wire and the tunnel beyond. The physicist doesn't believe this, but I make several demonstrations about how you might actually pass your hand thru the wire and your hand changes its appearance. I show him how his wife can do it and his children can do it. Then his wife and children step whole inside this way and disappear from his sight. This is to convince him that he'll have to try it too and come on thru. One other thing about the tunnel -- it seemed to alternate being a tunnel in the earth and a path thru a very thick forest. There were plants on the floor of the tunnel and lots of thick growth you could see along the sides of it."

            "content": "The dream starts out with me being stranded on an island and there are natives on this island and also a fire-breathing dragon. And I'm down on the edge of the beach of this island and I can tell the dragon is coming down toward the beach because I can see the orange flames shooting over the crest of the hill, and I know that I have to get out of there. And I know that all the natives flee from the dragon by running out into the sea. And if they can get out in the sea far enough, they won't be burned by the flames. So I dash out into the sea and swim way out, and I find a small boat out there. This boat is put out there by the natives and the first native to reach it each year has to make some sort of voyage which has some sort of special significance to them. Since I reached it, I use it to get away from the island on which I'm stranded. I sail for several weeks, I think, although I don't actually experience this time in the dream, but run out of supplies and haven't seen any other ships or islands or anything, so I come back. When I come back, this has given me sort of a special status with the natives of having become a very special person. Yet also they don't like me because I am a stranger and an outsider. The next part of the dream that I recall there is a trading post run by another white man on the island, and I have also picked up a companion somewhere, someone else about my own age, but I don't know who he is or where I got him from. We want to get off the island because the natives are becoming very hostile toward us and want to kill us, and we're in one of the rooms at the trading post outfitting ourselves and getting ready to get away. And I remember putting on a very wide belt, reminds me of a belt I owned several years ago, putting a sheath knife on beside it. I was wearing blue jeans and then I go out of this room to look for some sort of supply of some sort, and I wander down the hall and keep a close watch out for natives. I don't expect them to be in the building now, which is a very expensive building, but I do want to be careful because I know they probably do want to kill me. I go into one room off the hall that had a glass door on it because I have to go to the bathroom, and I notice there is a bathroom in there. It's a very strange bathroom. It's about the size of a closet and I have to stand up over this small toilet, but I'm also keeping my eye out for natives, and one little native boy does come past in the hall and sees me and comes running in. And I draw my sheath knife and trip him with it to keep him away, and he runs back and then brings back another native which I also have to push my knife at to keep away. Then I don't recall what happens next in this particular part of the dream. The next episode in here involves our collecting our supplies and trying to get away, and we told the natives something about the dragons coming to preoccupy them for a while. Then we're trying to launch a raft of some sort that we built. All I remember of this is that we've written sort of big words or rather big lists of supplies and parts on the sand right by the ocean and this is our raft somehow. I don't remember what happens after that, but anyhow this doesn't work. I think we try a sail on it for a while and then give up. I'm driving on land again, and we needed some time to get off again and somehow protecting ourselves from the natives. And so my companion and I decided to get some of the natives on our side in order to keep the rest of the natives away from. And so we worked up sort of a bodyguard and I've decided to teach the native -- they're real primitive -- how to use a club and a spear so that these natives will be able to hold off the rest of them. One of the natives is standing beside me. They're about 4-1/2 feet tall, sort of a brownish green color. I'll try to show them how to use a spear and a club and draw pictures, trying to explain. In drawing pictures of the natives, I seem to think the men have over a half dozen arms and 12 tentacles for legs."

I didn't know it very well. Somehow I guess it's a priest that criticizes me. I get kind of mad and tell him I'm trying to do the right thing, and if he wants me to do it letter-perfect, he should explain it to me as I go along. Then I go back and sit down and go thru some more of the service. I've left the church and am on some sort of bus and I have a companion who's not human. He's sort of a laboratory creation, something like a giant amoeba or something, but in the shape of a human being, and it's my job staying close to him and making sure he's in the human shape. If he doesn't have my moral support, he will disintegrate back into a giant amoeba. The bus stops. No, first it goes down a mountain road. There was some very beautiful scenery. It stops there and everyone gets out for a picnic or something and this amoeba human gets away from me. We try to find it, but we can't. They were a little bit terrified and eventually the amoeba creature has reproduced itself and started attacking humans. They were quite dangerous. It seems now that the amoeba creatures attacking me were roughly shaped like humans and I was spraying something on them to get them away from me. It seems that initially they were very susceptible to this stuff and you could control them with it, but they changed and it didn't other them much any more. Then somebody who's with me sprays some lemon juice on them and this makes bees start landing on them and stinging them. That finally drives the two of them off. There's some more I don't recall and then I end up in my own house now, up in the mountains, and the house is specially constructed so that these creatures who have now become very numerous and quite upset can't get in. For instance, there are no conventional locks on the doors because the creatures can extrude a pseudo pod that goes right thru the keyholes and everything and manipulate the lock. Instead there's a very complicated electronic electroletic sort of lock which takes the creatures a long time to open and soon as they  start fooling with it, you can tell because it provides a signal, a sort of warning signal. I'm in the house with all sorts of other people -- actually it seems like sort of a combination office building and laboratory -- and the signal goes off that one of these creatures is trying to get in. So we all go up to what we call the strong room, which is supposedly resistant to these creatures, a solid steel room near the roof of the building. We hop in a real large round elevator and go up several stories and go out onto the roof. But we haven't closed the door yet. The amoeba creature gets in and comes right up in the elevator after us, and somehow or another he gets in the steel room. I think it's because we haven't closed the door. I manage to get away by running out the door again back down the elevator and into an office. In this office is the psychologist, Gardner Murphy, whom I'm now identified with somehow. It seems that he's going to wait for the creature and try to talk to it and find out something about it or something like that. So finally the creature does come into the office, but apparently he's not in a talking mood or something because I smash a window behind me and leap out on the fire escape and escape that way and run down to where there's a space ship. It's a big round space ship that reminds me of something that I saw on the cover of a science fiction magazine that I saw last night and there were a couple of other people with me, and one of them is supposed to run up to the pilot control while the other one runs somewhere in the space ship, and I wanted to start the engines. The creature is right in the space ship by this time. And this person who is supposed to go to pilot controls hasn't made it yet, so I went up to them and the creature is only a few feet behind me, but I hit the controls and start the ship accelerating upwards very rapidly and also spinning on its own axis. And the centrifugal force keeps the creature from getting any closer to me. It's holding onto some beams for all it's worth. This doesn't bother me because I'm sitting in the pilot seat. I'm protected by some sort of anti-gravity field. The interior of this ship is very strange. It's all very open, just like beams here and there, strange machinery scattered about. I keep the ship spinning until we find some way to immobilize the amoeba creature. We give it some sort of injection or something. It still has a pretty humanoid form. This is a big ritual because it's the first one we've ever been able to capture. Now we will be able to study it and be able to combat it better. That's all of the dream I recall. One thing that happened yesterday that might have inspired this is that I was listening to some people talk about football players and joking how they were all meat and how a football player might be made of hamburger, but that wouldn't be firm and wouldn't hold its shape very well. A rather bizarre thought that carried over in this dream."

So Randy and Jimmy finished packing before me and they went up the hill a little ways and waited for me. Finally I got packed. I was carrying two packs, one strapped across my chest and one across my back, and I thought they would be quite heavy, but actually the weight distribution was very nice and there was very little strain on my muscles. So I started up the hill after them and we hiked on for a while. Then there was some action I don't recall, and then there was some girl along with us and this girl and I walked along ahead of the others and we were very sweet on each other. We all came to a place where there was some sort of wall across the trail and I decided we had to go right thru the wall. So I first sort of drew a big square on the wall and wanted us to just walk right thru it by getting in the proper frame of mind. But that didn't work, so I started tapping on the wall and several panels started drawing back, one after the other, till finally there was a big square on the wall and we all climbed thru it. It was night on the other side and we were out on the mountain again and could go along on our hike. Then there was some, I guess I would call it a fantasy, within the dream about our being in the White House. I don't remember what this fantasy consisted of, although there was no scene change to speak of. Then it was over with. We were hiking along up the mountain again and this girl was pregnant and she was pregnant by me, a couple of months pregnant, and she was very happy that she was and I was glad she was, and she was telling people about it very defiantly.

I was able to check thru the records, but all that I could figure out is that he had stolen it, a very valuable jewel, and probably gone off to Europe. Eventually I decided he must have taken an ocean voyage and we narrowed it down to one ship which was going to Spain. So my colleagues and I flew out to the ship and started searching it. I was guarding the cabin downstairs while they brought passengers thru to look it over for identification, and this little girl started walking in, oh, about 3 or 4 years old, with her mother. And I realized her mother was this man's wife and that she was in on the criminal activities, so I and another detective arrested her. I believe I pointed a gun at her and she laid down on a bed in another cabin, and I went back to the other cabin for something. It occurred to me that I had better search this woman for guns and I remembered that a lot of women criminals carried a gun strapped between their legs, so I went back in and wanted to search there, and this woman didn't want to let me, so I did anyway and, sure enough, she had a revolver strapped on the inside of her thighs. So I took that away from her and also she seemed to be naked from the waist up. I rubbed her breasts a little bit. Then there was some more about searching the ship and trying to find her husband."

So I didn't like the idea, but I did partly, then told him to push it in the rest of the way if I wasn't sure. It hurt just a little bit, but I was already partially numb. So he pushed in some more and then injected it, the major part of the syringe, and now as I look back at it, it must have been about 30 cc, which is astoundingly large, but I just thought it was a little large in the dream. Then he went ahead and drilled out the cavity in my left front tooth, filled, it, and then about the only major thing about this dream that I remember, the waiting room was right there where the dental chair was too. The number of people of waiting varied from one or two people up to about 30 people. It seems they were all waiting to be worked on in this chair also. I was there for almost all the day, and so their wait was in vain."

It seems that all the crew was gone from this ocean liner, which was anchored right off the shore of a small tropical island. I wanted to be able to operate this ocean liner because I didn't know how. One thing in particular I remember about it was that the ocean liner was floating very high out of the water, such that the door that you went in and out of in this thing was 15 or 20 ft. above the surface of the water, and there were waves of changing how high this ship floated above the water. But I didn't know how to operate it. Well, along on the horizon I saw a ship coming in and it was an aircraft carrier, a Untied States aircraft carrier, and it came right up to us with its bow coming right to the door. And its deck was just as high as our door was and it came up flush against the door so that one could just stroll off onto its deck. But I and a companion walked out across the deck, or rather we stepped out onto the deck, and then we had some sort of a car. It was an unusual car. I sort of thought it was a car designed by another nation or something like that. We should attract a lot of attention from the American sailors here. We drove over the deck and nothing happened. Then I had a sort of fantasy that we wanted to attract their attention somehow. So I had this fantasy about shooting a rocket from the car up ahead of us as if we were attacking them, but this didn't produce any results. Then we got up to where everybody was and we ran around and no one was paying any attention to us. It seemed very strange to us. We were walking around inside the aircraft carrier and in the passageway we found a couple of officers talking. We forcibly stopped them and told them, \"Look, we have an ocean liner here with no crew and we don't know how to work it.\" We want to do something with it, and weren't they even interested? And they didn't seem to be interested. So we went on back to the ocean liner. When we got back where the ocean liner was, it wasn't there any more. So we thought at first that they had given us some help and that they had moved it probably around into the river flowing out from this island which we couldn't see from where we were because there was a great big hotel blocking our view on the shore. There was a car there, though, sort of like a Ford Falcon or a Nash Rambler or something, and it was about 20 feet up in the air; no, more like about 10 feet up in the air on some stilt-like affair. So we climbed up into the car. I think my companion may have been my wife now, but I'm not sure, and pressed the mechanism that let these stilts back into the car, drove off over around the back of the hotel. But the ocean liner wasn't there, and the river kind of turned into a road that we were driving down which led into a parking lot. We turned around and came back to the hotel, and we were careful in turning around in the parking lot, not to go beyond a certain boundary because most of the island was inhabited by a sort of foreign creature which killed any man that went onto it. This part seems to have been inspired by a science fiction story I read last night. Anyway, we drove back to the hotel and started going down some stairs, and at the bottom was a tiger. We started going back up the stairs and there was a little switch built in the wall. We knew that when we threw this switch, at a certain point the tiger would not be allowed to come above that point and where we stopped him on the stairs would determine how he and all future tigers acted. The tiger was already up high enough when we saw this such that he would be bloodthirsty and try and take over from man. So I turned around and put my foot on his head and shoved him back down the stairs, half a dozen steps or so. Then threw the switch, which stopped him at a level where he would not attack me, but was also at a level where the tiger had to have some sort of duties to perform. So I finally figured out that we would train him to catch mice cause that sort of fitted in with his natural duties. And we did so. I don't know how. We just told him to catch mice or something like that. That was about the end of the dream."

And after the conference she and I took a train back to my home in my hometown and stayed over the night there, but I don't think there were any romantic goings-on between us. The next morning she got up and got dressed, ready to go back to the conference, but I slept late because today was a special invited address section or something like that, and I wasn't going to give one, so I thought I would stay home. But then about quarter to 8 in the morning it suddenly occurred to me, why couldn't I go and listen to the papers, which was why I was there anyway, no matter whether I was giving one that day or not. So I hurried, tried to get dressed in time because we had to leave the house by quarter after 8or something like that to make the train on time. And I got dressed in one pair of pants and found I didn't have a suit coat to match. I took those off and put on a pair of pants from my suit and found I couldn't find that suit coat. I went through a couple more things like this, and eventually I got dressed and we both -- well, it was too late for the train, so I decided to drive us both to New York. So I drove to the hotel, let the girl out, and gave my car to the doorman. And I took a card from him to take up to the desk as if I was going to be a guest, but I wasn't entirely sure that I was entitled to have the hotel park my car. So I went up to the desk and asked about it and they said no, I wasn't; I had better go around and pick it up. So I went around and picked the car up and so I had to go around and find a parking place. It was as if the hotel was now in my hometown. I was trying to remember where I could likely find a parking place. I couldn't remember. Finally, just by chance, I went up one street, and the scene became kind of rural. I eventually found a place to park in back of a little barn. I think I started walking back toward the hotel."

We had to stay there overnight or something like that rather than climb back. Then it was early next morning and our daughter's diaper was dirty. We didn't have anything to change her into. So we had to leave that one diaper on her, and we were thinking about climbing up the mountain again with her and thinking about how this would give us some sort of distinction of being the first people to climb this mountain with a baby with a dirty diaper.

I'm out in the back yard with my sister-in-law, Bonnie. I've decided to tease her about something. I recall that there is a brick in the wall which was loose and has something or other hidden behind it. I believe I dreamed once in that past few months I had seen Bonnie hide something behind this. I don't recall exactly. Anyway, I figured she must have some kind of dirty literature or contraceptive hidden behind it. She didn't want anyone to know about it, but I kid her and tell her I'm going to the wall and take out the brick and see what's behind there. But for some reason she goes over and pulls out the brick herself. There are a couple of newspapers and pamphlets hidden behind there. I assume they have something to do with sex. I never do actually read them in the dream. Then we opened a door beside the wall and go into a little area that is used for storing garden tools or something like that. She pulls out another brick which somehow opens a much larger hole in the wall than you'd expect. Here is a little spot built into the foundation of the wall big enough for one or two people to climb into and lay down on a blanket that's in there. A pillow. This is a little place where she used to go hide when she wanted to get away from everybody for a while. I become rather sexually excited in the dream and put my arm around her and ask her if she wants to climb in there with me and make love. She just kind of snorts at me and says no. We start putting several bricks back into the wall to hide this place again so no one else will find out about it. Although we took out one brick originally, there are a whole bunch of bricks to put back. When we get done, it's not as well hidden because there are some gaps between the bricks which you can see thru. There is some more action in this particular dream following this, but my memory of it is very confused and blurred and involved a Chinese girl somehow running around several of the rooms underground here."

Anyway, I was back in what physically seemed to be the high school I went to, but in terms of the people there, it seemed to be the grade school I went to. I was talking to one teacher, a red-headed woman, whose name I think was Miss Reed, about using her class to do this. She told me to please wait a few minutes while she finished the lesson she was giving and then when it was time for the experiment, I could use the children for the experiment. So I waited a few minutes and then came back into the room. I opened the door to see if she was thru teaching and she was. Some of the students were out in the hall. The room was a chemistry room, very similar to the one I was taught chemistry in, in high school. I went up beside her to tell her I was ready to start, and I was thinking of two aspects of the experiment, one that involved setting up a movie screen, the second getting out some chemical apparatus for everybody. This is all I recall about the dream. I can't recall exactly what the experiment was, or what this 3rd type of subject was. The dream was inspired in part by a discussion I had with someone I had last night about three types of Poltergeist experiences or a phenomenon."

I wasn't sure yet, but we might be at war and be bombed any time. So I and some other friends, I think there were two people, but I'm not sure who though, were stocking up on survival supplies. Then we were going out in the woods somewhere. We already had food and the like and they were getting a couple of last minute things in this hardware store. I was looking around to see if there was anything else that I thought would be useful. I stood up on a chair to look at some knives, sheath knives, which were displayed fairly high up on the wall. The interesting thing here is that I've dreamed of looking at this display before in this store, but I don't think I've ever seen them in real life. Anyway, I looked at one knife in particular which was a very large sheath knife, 12 or 15 inch blade. I noticed that the price was about $12 on it. I looked at that and looked at the others and realized they had double the prices on all these knives because they knew people would be anxious to buy them in the emergency. So I got down from the chair I was standing on to look at these and bawled out the clerk and said how ridiculous and how unpatriotic it was to double the prices because of the emergency. They ought to be ashamed. But he wasn't particularly impressed. There's some more action I don't recall. Then in the next part of the dream I'm up at this camp in the mountains, having driven there with my friends, except now my friends seem to comprise a whole troop of Boy Scouts. My age is indeterminate here, but I don't seem to be particularly older than the others, so I guess that makes me younger. There are several troops of Boy Scouts there, but it's apparently the end of the camping season and they are all leaving. So they all pile in cars and are gone. My troop left and although the camp has been supposedly closed up for the year, we make use of the facilities. I think the dominant idea here is that this camp is a good place to stay in case there is an enemy bombing. Then there's some more action I don't recall. Then I'm driving a car back from the camp over very narrow mountain roads, most of which are just paved with dirt. While I'm going down hills and around curves, I slow the car down by reaching way out in front of the car with a gigantic double pronged fork and sticking that into the ground, seemed to create a little friction that way and keep the car from speeding up too much down the hill. In the dream I am doing this to save wear and tear on the brakes on these rough mountain roads. There are one or two others in the car with me, but again, I think they're males, but I don't recall who they are or what their relation to me is. Going on driving down the road, we come into a town and it shifts over so that now we're all riding bicycles rather than being in a car. We were supposed to be following Route 65, but at certain crossroads in the town, we're not sure and go down Route 66. After a couple of blocks, we decide that's the wrong road. We're going to cut across so we can get on Route 65 again. So we turn around and go up another street and at one point several teenage girls on bicycles ride past us. We kind of wink at them and flirt a little bit. Then they're gone. We ride up and about the point where we get on Route 65, we ride into a supermarket from which it seems we've already done some shopping. Now we go out another door thru the supermarket and just before we go outside, there's a big box of kittens that someone is giving away. So I stop and look at them and finally pick out two that look real healthy. One of my friends is advising me to be careful which ones I pick because some of them are quite badly scratched and mauled from climbing over each other in this little box. So I finally pick two kittens and put them in a little box in the basket of my bicycle so I can take them on home."

            "content": "I was over at a nearby university listening to a lecture by a famous parapsychologist. The lecture was being held outside somewhere on campus in a little grove of trees and the weather very damp. Apparently it had rained recently. I was sitting beside someone I had met at the parapsychological convention this year. We were listening to a lecture by another person, Ramakrishna Rao, an Indian who had been at the parapsychology lab in years past. During the question period right after his lecture someone in the audience, which by the way seemed to consist of college girls besides psychologists, asked him how the parapsychology lab could be improved. He replied that what he needed to do to improve it was to get new bodies, names, and souls. It was terribly amusing in the dream. I recall in the dream I told my wife to try and come to this lecture, but I didn't know whether she had made it or not. In the middle of the lecture I had closed my eyes or fallen asleep or something like that. For a few seconds I had a vision of a tiny figurine in my hands of a woman. The figurine was 6 inches high or something like that. So when the lecture was over, we were the last ones to go and a lot of people went out when my wife came up. She was one of the last going out too. She was very mad at me because apparently she tried to sit next to me or talk to me during the lecture or something like that and I completely ignored her, according to her. I don't remember anything about this. Finally I remember the vision of this little figurine I had. I told her about that, but the woman in the figurine didn't particularly look like my wife. Finally I decided I had fallen asleep during the lecture and acted this way towards my wife when I was sleep-talking or something like that. The only conscious representation I had of it was the figurine. Now there's an incident which might have occurred at this point or when my wife came up to me, I'm not certain. The person I was with was telling how very much I should meet another person who had been at the parapsychological convention and I had apparently argued with this person at the convention a lot and yet we weren't mad at each other and we had so many things in common. And he was very anxious to have me meet this person. I can't for the life of me recall who this person was. So anyway, at this point my wife and I left the chairs where we had been sitting for the lecture and walked thru this little wooded grove and somehow it turned into nighttime now in the dream, whereas it had been day before. We got to the other side of the grove and there were several see-saws there and so we decided to see-saw. And they were very weird see-saws because they were motorized and I sat down on my side and pulled out the choke and starting lever, which was just under the bar of the see-saw. After several tries I got it started. It was a very cold thing and I had some difficulty starting it. So we got the motor started and the motor did most of the work of see-sawing. You just had to push down with your toe very slightly when you came down to push yourself back  up and start the cycle in reverse. Another couple came down to a second row of see-saws about 10 feet away from us and they were starting their motor and were going to see-saw also. We finished see-sawing and got up from the see-saw and were standing by the side of the road and my wife said the children were going to cross in a moment now. And I looked over and here was the big bunch of children on the far side of the road. There must have been 20-30 of them, 2nd or 3rd graders, something like that. They were all in this one big mass and somebody was looking up and down the street, and finally the person told them to go. They all ran across the street, crossed over to our side. This episode was succeeded by one which I think followed immediately, which bears no relationship to it at all. I was in an office at work and I just finished doing something with a big roll of bandage, or not a roll of bandage, a roll of adhesive tape, and I was rolling back up what I hadn't used from it, and it was cut in the middle, wide adhesive tape. Paul O. and Donald W. were in there and I asked Paul O. whether he had any use for this particular roll of adhesive tape. I was sort of hoping he would because this roll was a little bit ripped and it wasn't sticking to itself too well on the last part of the roll. He said he didn't and then this roll of adhesive tape turned into a roll of polygraph paper and it seems to be some data he had been looking for, for some time. He took it and went out. That's all of this dream episode I can recall. One other thing I recall from an earlier part of the dream when I was talking to my wife in the park, she also told me about how at breakfast that morning I tore up all sorts of things in the house and I didn't recall a single thing of this, and again we decided I must have been sleepwalking or in some kind of a fugue state or something."

So this is all very sketchy, but somehow I go into another room and step into the center of the room and sure enough, I found myself stepping into some distant place where the sour cream was bought. Then I stepped back again. Then there's another scene in which I get an invitation to a party in a distant place and so I figure that these must be aliens also giving the party because it's so far away. I'm not sure whether the invitation was actually addressed to me or whether it was addressed to the patients. So anyway, I go to the party that night. I do, in fact, go into my patient's house and stepping into the center of that room and there I am. I already reasoned before doing this that he probably works this gadget by simply stepping into the center and thinking about where he wanted to go, or if that wasn't the way it worked, that it would undoubtedly be set to go to the party anyway because my patients would have gone. The last thing I recall in this dream is several of the aliens talking to one another and I think I sort of shifted between the detached observer and identified with one of the aliens. I talk about how I discovered this device of theirs as well as their existence, but they'll be able to make me forget it completely, so that it doesn't really matter. Then they seem to be reading a note of mine in which I have left a note that I have discovered their technique and I know they'll probably make me forget it. In the meantime would they mind if I made use of that device? I had a vague recollection that they made me forget all about them by snapping their fingers at me."

The place is filled with college students, and I'm standing near the pulpit which is right in front of the altar, and a man is preaching there and this is a big, heavy, powerful-looking man who's dressed in some kind of priestly outfit. I know that the man is a fraud, but he has everybody just captivated by his charm. Apparently he owns this church or something like that, controls it, and suddenly I jump up beside this man and accuse him of being a fraud and particularly of having abducted my wife. Everyone goes into consternation and everyone starts milling around, and this person runs off from the pulpit and disappears somewhere. Everybody starts running out of the church, and I and a friend run out of the main door of the church also. I can't identify this friend, but I seem to know him very well in the dream. He's another young man about my age. Then it suddenly dawns on me that we have to do something to rescue my wife. This is probably a good opportunity while everyone is so disorganized. So we run off into the woods, off to the right side, and work our way back to a little square building with a big square door about the size of a garage door that was open. This is a secret entrance back into the church. Somewhere along the way I have picked up a bow and some arrows and a sword, as well as some small spears. And my companion was also similarly armed, and he leaped into the tunnel leading off from this doorway and gets behind a barrier about 10 to 15 feet in and all sorts of arrows fly around and almost hit him. I decide there's some kind of automatic device for releasing arrows whenever someone stands in the tunnel now. So I kept exposing myself for a second or so and jumping back each time a flight of arrows comes out. So finally the arrows are exhausted and that is what I was trying to do, exhaust the magazines. Then the second type of defense became operative because each time I expose myself, somewhere inside gallons and gallons of boiling water pour down and pour out of the tunnel now in layers several inches deep, but I do this several times and finally the water seems just about exhausted. I dash into the tunnel and get behind this little barrier and beside my friend and I notice that the water pours over a six-foot drop further back in the tunnel and then flows out. The floor slopes downward so it can. I then run forward shouting for my friend to come on so we can get inside before there's an opportunity for any defenders to come down here. I run well back in the tunnel, which incidentally is well-lighted and has polished wooden floors, paneled in fine woods and plastic, plush tunnel. It's more like a hallway since I'm inside the church now. It comes to a point where there are some stairs coming down, and I reach the end of this hallway and turn around and come back upstairs, go back up opposite of the direction in which I have been traveling. As I start to go up, I notice there's a little office out to the right, a secretary's office, and out comes the secretary of this priest, and she's carrying some arrows and a bunch of short spears which she apparently is going to take to him. I run over and threaten her with my spear, if you'll excuse the phallic symbolism, and take that bunch away from her and tell her to get out of here. She goes back in the office and I go on back up the stairs, and here is this priest. He doesn't have his priestly robes on any more, but wearing casual sports clothes; doesn't look anywhere near as impressive this way. He runs about a little bit trying to get away. I think I ask him where my wife is, but I don't really recall whether I do or not. My friend comes up about this time and helps me chase him. Finally I corner him and thrust these light spears at him, wound him lightly, but not particularly. Finally since he seems to be such a powerful man, I take out the sword I have, slash him several times with that. Finally, I partially cleave his skull and kill him."

I'm apparently working as an architect and I decide I'll make a model of a new home for her, which will be just what she wanted and will serve as an apology. So I scoop up a big pile of snow and proceed to model a home out of it which stands about, oh, about 3 ft. high, I guess, several feet long. The snow takes on the proper colors the brick house has. It becomes red where the bricks are, some other color for the roof, flagstone on some of the porches; it takes on that color. It becomes a realistic and quite a nice-looking model home. About the time I was finishing modeling this, I looked up and someone was walking down the street and I think it looks familiar. Sure enough, it turns out to be an old friend of mine, Bob Ganders.  We greet each other and I ask him what he is doing in the city where I go to graduate school , and he tells me his little girl is very sick and he's brought her back to the hospital. It doesn't seem incongruous at the time that he's brought her back all the way from a large faraway city to the city where I go to graduate school .

Now I and my girlfriend, I don't know who she is, must be out on this back porch. I've got a little flying device that my friend invented and I guess I have one for my girlfriend too. I'm not sure. I'm going to show her how to fly off in the night. We also had some type of infra-red scanning device which would allow us to see in the dark. There were some sort of semi-luminous signs I could put up in the air while we flew. I don't recall what they said. Well, I flew off a little ways and flew back. She stayed there. Then we were both back inside my apartment. No, we're still both on the porch and I had a sudden feeling that my friend had been caught by the criminals he was trying to hunt down, and killed. I told my girlfriend this. We went back into the apartment. Sure enough, a few minutes later we sort of heard it on the radio that he had been killed. Someone came up the stairs and brought me a message he had written to me just before he was captured or something like that. The message was in a flat wooden box. It was written on a whole bunch of pieces of wood, just as though it was cut up into a jigsaw puzzle, and they were blank and he had written on them. There was some sort of innocuous message on the front side. After the messenger left, I turned the pieces over and there was another message written on the back side as well as on  a little piece of white paper underneath the pieces of wood. This warned me that the criminals were trying to find out the secret of his flying device or something like that, and they would probably come after me since they knew that I was connected with him. At this point there seemed to be a number of other people in the apartment with us, as if I had been thrown a big dinner party and four or five other friends over besides my girlfriend. The correct number is indefinite in my mind. We said we had better lock up and take precautions so that the criminals couldn't come in on us. So somebody went off to lock the door up front. Somebody else went to lock the door to the back porch and to do this, they had to go into the kitchen, which was dark. Of course, it was still dark outside and the door had a glass window on the top half. A couple of girls were going to do this. They decided there might be a criminal outside. They didn't want the criminals to see them coming to lock the door because they might rush it before we got it locked. So one of the girls, who seemed to be some sort of a cross between my sister-in-law, Bonnie, and a female graduate student who I met recently, got down on the floor and crawled out the back door and sneaked her hand up and locked it without being seen, and crawled back. Then there was some sort of confused action I don't recall very well. Then the criminals had gotten into the apartment. They were trying to get the knife and machine away from me. I pretended I didn't know anything about it. I think they left because we had gotten off a warning to the police and they didn't want to be caught. After they had gone out, I revealed to everybody there that I could fly and I was going to chase the criminals now. I didn't seem to need any machine for it now. I said if anybody else could fly, he should also come on. I think one of the other girls, maybe it was my girlfriend, whoever she was, could also fly. I flew out the window and some of the criminals were just coming out of the building, really the whole gang of them. Now I go into a whole series of scenes where I would swoop down on them and hit them and push them in the truck they were trying to get away in. Superman-type actions."

I kept finding myself forgetting what the experiment was about and thinking I was going to do some other type of experiment. Finally I got to talk to the psychologist Gardner Murphy about this and explain the real experiment. Then I pointed out to him some sort of how we had both forgotten what the real experiment was about, to show how important it was to get this experiment done. It was a real strain all through this dream - which was much longer than I am able to recall - to keep the real experiment in mind and not get sidetracked on some sort of innocuous substitute."

            "content": "My wife and I were living in another town and we had gotten a little two-room apartment which was in back of a store with a back door to an alley. We rented it from a Ford dealer who owned the building it was in. It wasn't a particularly nice place, but we had fixed it up, gotten most of our furniture moved in, but apparently we hadn't quite moved in yet cause we were still living someplace else in town. Well, I was out walking this one morning. I happened to be walking in the neighborhood of the apartment. I thought I would stop over and take a look at the apartment for some reason. The address of the apartment incidentally was something like 106 Ford Hill. Well, I went around the alley and into the apartment and, much to my surprise, all our furniture was gone. There was a sign on the door which said something like 104-116. And there were several doors leading off of the apartment which all seemed to turn into just a big entrance hall for a whole bunch of other people's apartments. I thought at the time too that 104 was an apartment where one of my subjects lived. So I thought, well, they must have moved up to another apartment then. So I went upstairs. There were all sorts of other apartments and then I found ours, and I was shocked because there was no wall separating our living room from the hall. Our bed was placed out in a little nook in the hall with no wall separating it from the hall either. It was right by the stairway, and there were still some doors from other apartments leading right into our living room. Then I was extremely angry and indignant because we had been set up in this other apartment and now they gave us this thing, which in essence put us on public view in this crummy place where so many people would walk thru making noise and everything. So I went out and found somebody I knew, an older man. I was complaining to him about what had happened, and he was going to see the owner of the Ford place who owned the apartments and see what he could do for us. But I told him we just couldn't live there. My wife would be just shocked when she saw the place. Then the man I was talking to seemed to be an Egyptologist because he mentioned that he was excavating a new tomb and this tomb was a tombstone building, just one story tall, but it was quite long and had a lot of windows. My first thought was if we could possibly rent that as an apartment, but I decided it wouldn't be practical. They wouldn't have it cleared out in less than a year or so. It seems there were other Egyptian antiquities in this town also. That's about where the dream ended. There was a lot of carryover from elements of the previous day in this dream. Specifically, I had to get a new subject for my dissertation study and the boy I called to be a subject lived in 104 High Horse. The Ford dealer bit seems to have been inspired by a conversation with a friend about a car radio which made me think about the Ford dealer where we had just bought our Ford last summer. The anger and indignation I showed in this dream might be a reflection of the way I felt last night to some extent because the subject I had been training for my study had to drop out of it, and even though he had a valid reason, I'm sure I felt pretty hostile and upset about all these things. I didn't let myself feel it too much."

            "content": "In this dream my sex keeps changing and I'll try to keep track of it, but I don't think I recall. The first part of it that I remember I'm up in the mountains at what seems to be my parents-in-law's cabin except it's not exactly like it and it had a dirt floor. It had all sorts of leaves and stuff over it. It's as if it used to be a church and that there used to be witchcraft practice at it I've been trying to practice some kind of witchcraft from which I've dug up all sorts of things from the floor of this birch cabin, but I decide they're not powerful enough, that they are too old and they should be left here to protect the place or something. So I buried them again and my identity seems to shift and it was as if some old woman had been practicing this stuff and then buried it again, and she's been arguing with my wife's parents that they should put a wooden floor in the cabin. I don't think they know why, but her reason was to make sure nobody would dig up this stuff again. So then the scene shifts and I'm myself again, but I'm not particularly aware of it. We're in the city again and we're trying to get rid of anything involved in magical preparations which were left from this witch's activities. The main thing that's left is a black cape. Now this cape in the dream is really just a big square piece of black cloth. It's very similar to a piece of black cloth I had as a child that I used to pretend was a cape and had various fantasies about being a magician or a vampire. I used to use it as a Halloween costume. This black cloth gradually changes in the dream such that it becomes a raggedy old fur coat, and it's important to burn this old fur coat in order to get rid of any influences of the witch. So I and a number of other people -- I don't know who these are -- are trying to burn it and I try to light the coat directly, and it won't burn very well. It flickered for a bit and then would go out. The fur doesn't seem to catch at all So then we set it up on a framework with a pile of leaves underneath. All this time we're in sort of an alley between two brick buildings. So we set fire to these leaves and things piled underneath, and then I get a whole bunch of big photographs, 4 x 6 prints, to throw in the fire to help it burn. These photographs have come from the student newspaper on campus, and are extras from their files. I'm looking thru these photographs as I throw them in and occasionally pulling out one that I don't want to burn. One of the first ones I pulled out had a picture of a very nice girl with no clothes on, so I decide to save that. Then I seem to pull out several that seem to be photographs made of me when I was a young child. I can't recall now what I was doing in these photographs, but I recognized them at the time as photographs taken of me which I hadn't seen in years. Well anyway, I saved some of these photographs, threw others into the fire, trying to make the coat burn, and the coat still wouldn't burn at all to speak of. Then I went off and did something and the place where we were burning the coat was sort of the student newspaper, I think. I noticed someone from the newspaper, a man, had picked up the photographs I had put aside to save and was filing them away in their files. I argued with him about this, that these were my photographs. He said no, they were the paper's, and I argued that they had thrown them out and I wanted to save those and they were mine anyway. He would have none of this argument and continued putting them back in the files, so I went out in anger and told him that the curse would probably fall on them because they interfered with burning the coat. I don't know yet if the coat managed to burn or not. I suspect not. Now my sex seemed to change and I was a young woman. I went up several flights of stairs to my apartment, which I apparently shared with this old woman who was a witch. I was very ambivalent about what I had done. I was glad to get rid of her and yet afraid of having burned her things and gotten rid of her. I don't know how I had gotten ride of her, incidentally, but I knew that she was dead. Yet in some ways I kind of missed her because I liked her, so I went into my apartment and was still very mad at the people at the newspaper and so I practiced some kind of spell to bring them bad luck or something. It was as though I was following in the witch's footsteps. And a lot of time passed, although I didn't experience it. And still as the young woman I was having trouble getting jobs and the like because of my connection with the witch. Finally I thought I would have a job as a servant to some woman who lived in one of the apartments downstairs. I went down and knocked at the door and it turned out she just wanted me to babysit for the afternoon while she went out shopping, but I took it anyway. The woman went out and I went into one of the back bedrooms This incident might have happened before this, but I'll describe it as happening now because I'm not sure. I went into one of the back bedrooms, which was only partially lit, and the old witch kind of materialized in the bed, and I was quite frightened, and she was calling my name, which I forget. It was some girl's name, but I don't recall it. Finally she dematerialized again and was gone. I went up to the front of the apartment to take care of the little children. There was a little boy and a little girl, both of them somewhere between 4 and 5, and I had put the children to bed. They were sleeping side by side in a big double bed, and I was telling them to go to bed, and as I was covering them, they both simultaneously became possessed by the witch. I jumped on top of them to hold them still and there was some tendency on their part to disappear and for the body of the witch to take their place. My sex may have been a little bit indeterminate at this point. There were some definite sexual feelings aroused in me by my kneeling over the body of this witch. I think I was trying to keep the body of the witch from materializing and taking over the bodies of these children. Then there follows some confused events which I don't recall clearly, the outcome of which was that I had died. I was a male again, incidentally. I was starting down a road after having died and there was a voice speaking to me from somewhere, and I asked it which road was the road to hell. It told me and told me that it was the one I would have to go down, and the road said something about experiencing again all these experiences of life. So I started down this road, which incidentally looked like a road I drove down yesterday on my way back from a psychiatric convention, but after going down this road a little ways, the voice told me to turn off onto a side road. I did and there was a stream with a little bridge across it, and there was a swing on the bridge, and a young girl in her teens, swinging in it. The voice told me here was an opportunity to redeem myself for having been involved with this witchcraft in my life, that this young girl was going to swing kind of hard in the swing and her father, who was standing on the other side of the bridge, didn't want her to. The girl actually had some suicidal tendencies, and if I could stop her from committing suicide, it would be a good thing for me. So I walked over to the bridge and the girl's father came up behind her. I sat down on the swing beside her. She couldn't see me or touch me or anything because I was dead, and her father told her a couple of other things and that she shouldn't swing so high. She promised him she wouldn't and then her father went off on some kind of business. Then my voice instructed me to see to it that the girl went somewhere and then learned how to make love and then came back here. So I was wondering how I was going to explain to her since she couldn't hear me, and then I began to wonder whether this was a test in itself because I thought at first that I should do exactly what this voice told me, but then I thought if this girl is feeling kind of suicidal and if she goes off and makes love for the first time and then feels guilty afterwards, and then goes off and commits suicide, which is what I'm supposed  to prevent, maybe I was supposed to think for myself and not give unquestioning obedience to this voice. So as I was thinking about this problem, this is about the point where I woke up."

            "content": "I am alongside a stream, a heavily wooded area, which seems to be similar to a swamp area near my home in my hometown. One other person is with me. This person's identity seems to shift during the dream between that of my wife and parapsychologist J. B. Rhine. I and this other person, who seems to have my wife's identity now, cross over this stream. The stream is 50 feet wide and ranges from several inches to several feet deep. My wife and I cross over and to do this we walk across a collapsed bridge. The bridge is collapsed in that most of it is fallen in, but there's still one rail running across it. It amounts to walking across a log that's just a foot or so across the water. It's a thing that you have to balance yourself quite carefully to get across, but we both get across with no mishap. We do something or other while we're on the other side, but I don't recall what. Then we have to go back and then it's at this point that the other person seems to be J. B. Rhine who crosses over ahead of me. Then I start to cross back over this stream, but I'm not sure of my balance. So I go back and there's an old dock right beside the collapsed bridge and out on the dock is a long iron rod, as well as the thing on the top that looks like an air filter on a carburetor. I figured the rod would serve me for balance or to actually push against the stream to maintain my balance. So I crawled out on the dock to get this and I have to be very careful because some parts of it are rotten. I have to keep off those as much as possible and spread my weight out so I won't go through. I get the iron rod and the carburetor thing, and also I notice that sticking in a tree stump near the end of the dock is an axe, but it's very strange because it has a shaft about 3 feet long or so. Halfway up the shaft is an axe head and at the top is a hammerhead, although this may have shifted into two axe heads in the dream. This thing had been sitting there for weeks anyhow, so I figured I might as well take it and make use of it because no one else seems to want it. So I take that along with me also. Now holding the axe and carburetor thing in one hand and using the iron rod and pushing against the bottom of the stream, I cross over the stream with no trouble. On the other side - my companion is now my wife again -  I also manage to pick up a suitcase somehow. It seems that in this air cleaner-type gadget I have brought across the stream (after having caught them on the other side) a baby fox and 4 or 5 baby beavers. Now the suitcase thing has turned into an open cage-like affair and the baby beavers and fox are in there. Here the mother fox comes out of the woods, prowls around looking very pitiful, so I decide to giver her baby back, and I do. She makes off with it. Then the cage that I have the beavers in is very strange because there's wire mesh on both sides. One side is almost completely open. At first I try to coax the beavers back into the air cleaner thing so they can't escape, and I finally get one in, but he gets back out again. He seems to fill the whole thing up himself anyway. So then I decide to leave them in the open cage and so I sway the open cage back and forth in such a way that the centrifugal force keeps them from climbing out over the edge. I go on up the hill to our home and the route I follow is pretty familiar. I think I've followed it in many dreams before, although it doesn't correspond very well to anything I know in reality, except there is one change in the route. When I get to the top of the mountain, there's some stairs which I then follow up the rest of the way, and these stairs seem to be inside an apartment house where we live. Some woman who is a neighbor of ours, I don't know who she was, sees me and remarks about the beavers, how valuable they are for their skins or something like that. But I tell her I'm primarily interested in watching them grow and I go on up the stairs and leave her."

We park and have to go to a new building across the street, which is some sort of physics laboratory. It's raining. This older man has an umbrella, but this other boy and I run across the street in the rain. We run inside. They haven't quite completed work on the building yet. We get inside to this very large room. The ceiling is 50 ft. high or so and there are all sorts of people milling around in there talking. I'm looking for a girl, Joyce Reader, who is a girl I liked very much in early high school, but whom I haven't thought of in years. I'm wandering around looking for her in this big room, when bits of the plaster from the ceiling start to flake off and fall down. There's a horrible cracking sound and the crack spears in one wall, several times it extends itself, making a cracking sound each time And somebody said it was just a normal settling of a new building, but I get kind of worried and work my way around and get out of the room and run out of the building. While I'm doing this, the plaster starts falling off the ceiling in much greater quantities and people realize it's quite dangerous and they start getting out. Once I'm outside the building, the building seems to be the United Nations building instead of physics building. I'm trying to help report on the damage, and I'm talking to a couple of secretaries and describing to them what was happening inside. We decided we needed information about what was happening on the top of the building and I have a big wooden board, about 4 feet by 2 feet or something like that. I flopped this and tried to fly to the top of the building with it, but I can't get more than 2 feet or so off the ground in spite of a lot of muscular effort. The building is about 50 stories, so this isn't very practical. One of the secretaries tells me there's a lad on the 14th floor doing work on anti-gravity and go up there and get an anti-gravity unit, but not to tell anyone because this is strictly classified work. So I apparently go up the stairs or something and get to the 14th floor and get an anti-gravity unit from some female technicians who work there, and fly up to the top of the building and make a report, and also fly around and direct the people who are coming out so they don't get into traffic jams or panics. There's some intervening action I don't recall. Then I'm going back into the building, which has been repaired and is safe now, and I want to go back to the lab where I got the anti-gravity unit. I get into the elevator, which I had some difficulty finding because there were a bunch of lockers which kind of looked like elevator doors around, and I also noticed they had some separate corridors for Negroes, which bothered me. I get in the elevator and tell the operator 4th floor, and as it starts to stop, I realize I want the 14th, and I tell him that and we go on up. It's a rather dizzying ascent, which is quite fast. On the 14th I got out and I think the room is 213, and I go into 213 and that's not the place, so then I wander around to the east side of the building and find the laboratory. When I walk in, the first person is a big powerful man, and since this is classified and he doesn't know that I was there before, he pretends he doesn't know what I was talking about. Finally, I tell him not to worry because after I figured out how the unit worked, I destroyed the original one and so the secret wouldn't get out. I needed something else from the lab or something like that, but he told me I couldn't get into the lab. He slept right there in the entrance room and he would catch anybody that tried to get in. So then, just to show him that he shouldn't worry about the secret device getting out, I showed him a device I had in my pocket, which wasn't one of the anti-gravity type devices, but some other sort of gadget of no consequence, but I just slipped it out of my pocket and slipped into a little box and held it up to him and told him it was a new kind of anti-gravity unit. And I slipped it in my pocket and it proceeded to float in the air right in front of him. This convinced him that I had duplicated his own invention."

And she climbed into this gadget, as a way of getting into the country we're flying to -- which I think is Sweden -- for free because she thinks she'll be mistaken for a body that's being shipped back to Sweden. I and a number of other people are in one of the forward compartments of the plane, and the young man who's traveling with us goes back to the baggage compartment to look for someone else who's -- well, he goes back to look for this young woman, and he sees her through the glass panels of this coffin device, and he tells her that he realizes that she's not dead.

I'll dictate the latter one first, since I woke up and made a few notes to remind me of the first one. In this dream my wife and I are in my mother's home. She's out in the living room with my mother and a couple of other people, who turned out to be Florence and Chris. I'm in the bedroom, still in bed, and our daughter is in there with me. And another figure's in a bed on the other side of the room. Eventually this figure says, \"Wouldn't you like to play with some blocks?\" and I realize it's my Aunt Flossie. And I say that our daughter would like to play with them. The blocks seem to be the blocks from the Binet kit. I don't realize this at the time, but my Aunt Flossie died some two or three years ago. well, I eventually go out into the living room, and with my mother. And I don't remember whether my wife's around now or not, but Florence and Chris and Aunt Flossie. And Aunt Flossie's out in the kitchen making some coffee, and I'm out there with her, when suddenly I realize that she's dead. And I look at her and tell her, \"You're dead; you're not here!\" And she doesn't have much of a reply. And I figure if she's dead, there's something very unreal about the whole thing. So I said, \"If you're dead, none of this is real.\" So I reach out and touch the coffee pot, which is boiling, and it doesn't feel hot, as I suspected it would. And I pass my hands thru the gas flames on the stove, and they're only very slightly warm. And I'm sort of satisfied at having proved my point. And I wander thru some other rooms, and I'm starting to go into the living room, and Florence and Chris and Aunt Flossie are starting to follow me. And they're starting to annoy me, because I said if this isn't real, I'll start manipulating it to be somewhat better now. So I step into the living room and make a heavy wooden door appear behind me and slam shut in their faces. And I make another one appear at the other door of the living room and slam that shut. The living room doesn't look really like the one in my mother's house. And then I look out the glass window and fly out right thru it, and fly away high up into the sky. And I sail around for a while, and then want to fly thru the night sky, like I did in the previous dream I'll describe later. So I close my eyes and wish myself to be on the other side of the world, where it's night with the moon out, flying in the sky. But I open them again and nothing's changed, except it seems to be a little bit later. So I continue sailing up in the sky here, about 50 feet or so from the ground. Then I fly over some trees which are around this very big house. The house is about -- it's brick, 3 stories tall. But then, above the 3 stories, it now has 2 more stories of wood which form sort of a very deluxe penthouse, with trees placed all around it, screening it from view from the ground. And down below on the ground, there are all sorts of holly wreaths and Christmas decorations up around the house. So I fly in and out among the trees and in toward this house, and several times I almost bump into the walls, but I stop myself in mid-air and turn around. Incidentally, I don't have to flap my, I don't have to fly by flapping my arms as I did in the previous dream. And eventually in my flying around, I notice a woman standing on one of the porches. And I fly around some more and eventually get into the house. And I've already worked out in my mind a sort of fantasy about this woman. She lives alone, with just one servant, because her husband died a long time ago. And I fly inside the house and meet her, and start talking to her. And she's been in seclusion for five years since her husband's death. And she looks sort of like a combination of a child that's multiplied in size and an old woman. But this isn't the way I want it in the dream. I want her to be young and beautiful, even though she's been secluded, so I can try to seduce her. So I manage to change her some in the dream, but not a great deal."

            "content": "The following dream occurred about two hours earlier, and I woke up afterwards and made a few quick notes before going back to sleep. In the dream I'm in one of our laboratories at the hospital, helping Jimmy Scott and somebody else change the paper on a polygraph and plugging it in. And when it comes time to plug it in, I pivot up to a horizontal position, floating in the air, and float across the room and push the plug in. And they are a little bit amazed at this, but don't take too much notice. Then I float out into the corridor, and decide to float around the hospital, as long as I'm floating, and enjoy it. And I float past various bunches of doctors and nurses here and there. And occasionally people notice me, but usually they don't. And finally I stop and talk to one nurse how that what I'm doing is impossible so that everybody refuses to notice me. They're not in the least bit aware of me. She kind of smiles at me and agrees yes, but I realize that even she isn't fully aware of what I'm doing. During all this floating, in order to move around, I have to flap my arms sort of as if I were swimming, and the air was very thick, which isn't the way I usually fly in dreams. I usually just will myself to go. And the scene shifts now, and I seem to be flying along a few feet above the floor in this very big department store, which has marble floors similar to the hospital. And there's a big ramp leading from one floor to another, and so I fly down to the other floor. And this gets into a kind of confused sequence when I'm flying after this girl I see ahead of me that I seem to want to meet. And I eventually catch up with her and want to buy her some socks and underwear. But some other girl comes up, who thought I was chasing her or something. And she's quite upset because I'm buying something for the 2nd girl, but she buys something just to sort of rationalize her existence there. Meantime, the first girl's wandered back the way we came. And so I start going back after her. The girl then sort of disappears from the story, and I find that I'm in my bathroom at home, floating horizontally in the air. And I'm floating back and forth and bumping against the door at one end and the wall at the other end, where the window is. And I want to float thru the window and outside, but I can't float thru it; it seems solid. But eventually I start hitting harder and harder against the wall where the window is, and all of a sudden it turns into a door that pops open. And I float out into the night sky. It's a very beautiful night out, with the moon half full and the stars shining. And I keep thinking how in the dream that this is what I've always wanted to do, to float thru the tree tops silently at night. And so I proceed to float silently thru the tree tops at night. And the scenery is sort of a combination of my college's town and my hometown. and I float around, here and there, looking at things, and I still think that I ought to be able to float thru things, so I try hurling myself thru the air at a tree trunk, to go thru it, although I'm a little bit leery of the process. And sure enough, I just bump into it and bounce off, but fortunately it was a soft bump. But then I fly around a little bit more thru the tree tops. I never get much more than 20 feet or so off the ground. And I notice a girl out in the woods, off one of the regular paths here. And I fly over toward her, wondering if she can see me, because I don't think that she'll even know that I'm there. And as I approach her, she's laying down and spreading her legs apart. She's dressed in a very scanty costume. So I fly over top of her, and start rubbing her, and she's very much aware of me. And we actually start to have intercourse. But I think, this is going to distract me from this more wonderful thing of flying thru the trees at night. So I just break connection with her and fly off again. So I fly away and then I find myself back home. But home is a place I've never seen before now, with very high ceilings. And I'm in a bathroom off a bedroom, and in the bedroom are my mother and my father, who's also been dead several years, and our daughter, and some miscellaneous person. And I'm floating near the top of the bathroom door. They don't see me, but I wonder if our daughter will see me, and sure enough, she looks up and says hi to me. And I also see my own body, lying asleep on the bed. And then comes a little episode where I almost have the door closed on me, and I move back into the bathroom and eventually slip out of the bathroom again before the door's closed completely on  me. And then there's something of a lapse, and next thing you know, I'm in bed, and beside me in bed is my mother. And my mother is very desirous of having sexual relations, and so we start having them. And I rationalize this at this point by saying that my father's been dead for several years and my mother's very lonely and horny, and so that this would be alright. I might add that in both dreams there was a great deal of conscious awareness of the fact that I was dreaming and many attempts to manipulate the dream content."

            "content": "A short little dream during an hour's nap. The first thing I recall being aware of in this dream was being in a hallway. It was windowless. And I was aware to a very great extent of the fact that I was dreaming. And I was at a point at a stairway in the hallway where I could go up or down. When I started to go down these very bleak concrete stairs, I realized that going down these stairs probably represented symbolically a descent into my own unconscious mind. And this was somewhat frightening at the time because I thought I'd have to deal with all sorts of unconscious material that would be represented by monstrous creatures. And so I went down one flight, really questioning whether I should go, because I really didn't feel like dealing with these monstrous creatures right now. And on the other hand, I didn't just want to run away from them. And so after going down one level, I walked along a hallway a little bit, and started thinking about how I'd have to fight these monstrous creatures, and fantasized myself some weapons. First I thought of creating a sword for myself, and then thought that probably wouldn't be too effective against them. As along as I was going to create weapons, I would go all the way. So I fantasized a protective force field around myself to keep anything from getting thru to me, and a little gun which would disintegrate anything I pointed it at. But although I hadn't met any monsters yet, I decided this wasn't what I really wanted to do right now, so I went back down the hall and up the concrete stairs again. And I went up several flights, thinking that symbolically I was starting to go into higher levels of consciousness this way, and that if I went high enough, I might have a very mystical or psychic type experience. As I went up the stairs, the steps became less dingy-looking and dank. And then at one point I walked over along one of the halls to a wider set of stairs in the center of the building, thinking that symbolically I would be ascending to the upper reaches of consciousness in a more grand way this way. And eventually, exercising a fairly high degree of conscious manipulation, I ended up in a tower room up at the very top of this building, from which I was able to look out over the countryside. And I was careful not to stand too close to the edge, because I hadn't created the railing very strongly. Then there followed some conscious effort on my part to keep maintaining this dream of being at the top of the tower, and this was interspersed by two or three episodes, I don't recall exactly where they occurred, but they were from here on, of partially waking up from the dream and starting to hear the sounds of the house - in my body - but by an effort, managing to suppress them again and slide back into the dream. Each time I went into this condition of hearing what was going on in the room about me (what I thought was going on in the room around me), I noticed my body seemed to be fairly effectively paralyzed right at the time also. There was more of the dream in which I was still semi-conscious and controlling it, but I don't recall it."

I am floating in the air and trying to project, but can't fly up thru the ceiling, although my hands seem to penetrate slightly into it. I become more conscious and decide to try harder. I say the \"LW\" and \"Ra\" to myself several times. It seems as if I hear, my physical body seems to be speaking the words also (the sense of dual consciousness is quite strong at some points in the dream) and I wonder if I will wake anyone and if my physical body is really saying them. I try to make my sounding of the words \"purely mental\" so as not to disturb anyone. The vowel sounds had two effects: (1) I sailed back and forth thru the air from the front door to the kitchen much more rapidly than before (every couple of seconds or so) as if I were gathering energy to break thru the walls and out; and (2) my position changed from horizontal on my stomach to one in which my feet were straight up in the air and I sailed up thru the ceiling and 50 feet or more into the sky. (Memory is somewhat fuzzy from here on) Although I was now up in the sky, I could not see anything, for my eyes were closed. I tried hard to open my \"astral\" eyes, but couldn't. There was a strong sensation of my physical eyelids straining (sense of dual consciousness was strong here), and I was afraid they would open and wake me. At one point there was a flash of light in my right eye, as if it had opened momentarily (on reflection, I believe the room was actually almost perfectly dark at the time of this dream), and this discouraged me from further trying.  I seemed to be able to move my \"astral\" limbs quite freely, even though I couldn't open my eyes. Some action I don't recall very well. Then I'm finally seeing, and flying a few feet off the ground in the back yard, trying to fly higher. But my mother keeps reaching up from the ground and keeping me from flying higher, despite my entreaties to let go. Eventually I am able to fly 50 feet or more and off. I don't recall the rest of the dream, and I guess my semi-consciousness lapsed into dream consciousness."

And so the guard lets us into the little room where he stays with the teller while we try and do something to him. And while we're in there, I say to the guard, \"Isn't it kind of dangerous to let us in here with you? Suppose we were trying to rob the bank?\" And he tells us that since we were trying to help the teller, obviously we couldn't be bank robbers. Then we knock the guard out, and I go down into the vaults thru a trap door in the floor of the guard's room. And we have to hurry because we know the alarm has been set off by now. And there are all sorts of boxes, kind of like shoe boxes and file boxes, and I'm going thru them rapidly trying to find money. And I don't find much money, but a few boxes I do find money in, I hand up to my partner, who now definitely looks like a turtle. And then we rush out of the back of the bank, and run over some fields. And my memory becomes rather hazy at this point."

            "content": "An intriguing dream which seems to strike me as very symbolic. In the first part of this dream I am the captain of a sailing ship of some sort. It's a very primitive thing. And I have quite a large crew, but they're not individualized at any time. And it seems as if the world has been destroyed in some kind of a toxic catastrophe or something. And we manage to sail to England somehow, and Britain has held out very well against the catastrophe. And they make me part of their navy or something, and give me an atomic submarine to command, which, of course, is a marvel of power and intricacy compared to what I'd been used to. Then we have sailed to my home in N.J. somehow. And there are now four levels to my home in N.J., and we go down to the lower levels, which were not known to me when I was a child and lived there. And I have been to these lower levels in other dreams, particularly the lowest one. The lowest one is at least a sub-basement, if not lower. And in the previous dream in which I had been here, I -- and I don't recall if anyone else was with me -- dug up a grave there, trying to find some sort of treasure. And I believe I found there was no treasure in the grave itself. However, there were other things in the cellar, instruments of sorts, all sorts of things that you'd find stored in a cellar. And I had taken these with me the last time I'd been here in a dream, and this apparently had made the trip worthwhile. Well, now I had come back, and the cellar was a fearful place, and there'd been some sort of tragedy connected with the last trip there. So I was very sure about getting some adequate electric lights in the cellar so we could see and not have any shadows that were too deep. And I had my crew go down, and I went down too, and we took out some more tools and instruments and stuff; these were the last things that were still of some value. And we loaded these onto the submarine, including a very large tube, and by large I mean something on the order of 15 or 20 feet long and 3 or 4 feet thick, although one man carried it to the submarine. And we took this into the submarine and used it as ballast, and it fitted around everything we already had down there. It was made of brass, I believe. And when it was being put in, there was something dangerous about the part of the submarine where the ballast was. Somebody, the last time we had been to the cellar, had loaded something in and gotten trapped in the ballast thing somehow and been killed. And his body had been left in there, and it was turned into radioactive dust or something like that. Anyway, we were afraid that one crewman who had loaded this pipe in there would be exposed to the body and die from it. But he reported that the body was just dust and a skeleton now, and he wasn't affected in the rest of the dream. When we left the cellar, I think I tried to close it off thoroughly, so that nothing could get in or out of it. I think I'm not really sure whether I did or not. We did pull the electric lights back out, although there were one or two which were actually permanently installed down there, and I left those going. Oh, also another thing that seems symbolically important, the level immediately above this sub-cellar was now the first floor of the house, instead of the sub-cellar being three floors below it. And I seemed much more competent and masterful in my actions in the cellar this time than I had been before. This before dream, incidentally, may have been well over a year, maybe several years, in the past. We then sailed on off in this atomic submarine, and we sailed -- oh, as we started sailing off, we had some extra people on board for some reason, and I switched identity for a while to someone other than the captain of the ship. And I was standing right by the forward ventilator so I'd be sure to get enough air as the submarine started. Then we sailed around what had been New York, but it was all flooded. Only second stories of buildings stayed above things. And we stopped before one building, which was the second floor of the Smithsonian Institute, even though in the dream I thought this was N.Y. before. And this man got out, and he was going to go back to his office, which had been on the second floor of the Smithsonian. It struck me as a little bit strange in the dream, because I thought the flooding had occurred more than 75 or 80 years ago, and so this man couldn't be that old, but I apparently revised my date in the dream to compensate for this man going back to his office. And he was given an hour to come back; if not, we were going to search for him. And he left and went across, I guess he had a boat, but I didn't see it at the time, and it seemed as if he was practically walking thru the water. And he was wearing a uniform just like the captain's, except he had on a conventional hat instead of an officer's cap. And about ¾ of an hour passed and he hadn't come back yet, so we sent a robot in after him. And the robot took along a small portable boat too. And the robot had gone into the building and was searching when the dream ended. I might add that in the cellar the danger was definitely personalized, as if it were some sort of demons or something. A psychological note which might help interpretation: The last week or so I've been thinking how much I've always been looking for a father figure that I could admire the past few years, and thought that just recently I had actually realized this and stopped doing it. And last night before this dream, I had been thinking of how I had finally realized that I could not expect perfection from my friends and I should accept my friends even though they had some faults. I applied this line of thinking particularly to J.B. Rhine, who I may have looked after as a father figure to some extent. And I started applying this line of reasoning to myself, accepting my own faults, and thought that my own attitude up this point had always been a matter of recognizing that I had faults, but not accepting them as me, but only as something to get rid of. I thought that perhaps I could accept these faults as part of myself, even though I would like to be able to change them. And I thought I should go on thinking this way, but my mind slipped away from it and didn't follow up this line of thought, and I put it out of my mind. The dream seems in some respects to have been a continuation of this line of thought. This thing about not looking for a father figure any more seems particularly symbolic in the dream, because one of the sailors wanted to dig into the grave to look for some treasure, but I knew in the dream that there was none there, that I had tried digging into that grave on my previous dream and there was nothing in it."

And we built some sort of a log cabin up on stilts. And we've cached some of our food underneath the cabin. And some Indians gather in the woods to try to steal it. And the Indians are wearing white robes. And several of us fire some shots in the air, well, we fire toward them, but we don't hit any of them, and chase them away, and they run further back in the woods and regroup there. I'm not sure just who I'm identified with at the moment, among the pioneers. but then I observe the actions of this one pioneer, whom I later become identified with, and it seems that one Indian is stealing right back to the cache. And there's very little gunpowder left, but this pioneer runs right up to the Indian very silently and shoots him and kills him. And the musket he uses is rather strange because the barrel is bent. It comes out straight and then there's a sudden bend of about 25 degrees; the barrel goes on for a foot or so. And he does kill this one Indian. I think the other Indians take him away, the dead Indian, that is. Then the pioneer that killed the Indian seems to go psychotic for a while, and he has a long sword in a sheath that is open along one side so the sword keeps slipping out. And in some way he seems to resemble a monkey and also there's something kind of obscene and phallic about the whole thing. But he recovers from the worst part of it in a few minutes, and then just seems to wander about the camp, suitable for guard duty or something. The other pioneers go out to work, and now I gradually become identified with this one pioneer. And he's wearing some white sheets and some leather draped over him, and none of the other pioneers have these white sheets (they look more like white rags, draped over their shoulders). Now a group of Indians comes up, including an Indian priest, who is also wearing white and leather. And so I step up to him, figuring I'll pretend to be our priest, and see if I can gain some advantage. The leader of the pioneers comes up to me to say no, but I get him away somehow. And the Indian priest tells me about a problem he has in curing somebody, that he wanted to cure him by giving him steak, but he couldn't get any steak, which was an obvious reference to their failure to steal from our cache, which did have some steak in it. So I go off with the Indian priest, down this trail. And he's a kind of short, dumpy man. And another Indian looks at me and starts to grab me as we go down, but he sees that I'm with the priest and that it's all right. And we turn off the trail into a church where the priest wants to show me something. As we're turning off, I notice that over to the side that there are some street lights, and a modern city ahead of us, which strikes me as a little bit incongruous in the dream. But we don't go on to it. We go up to the back of this priest -- up to the back of this church, lighting our way with torches. And this priest has to hold this torch while he goes thru what I think at first is his special entrance to the church. But it's a rectangular opening in the concrete about the size of a coffin, and he goes down thru this hole down at the bottom. And he seems to be having some difficulty getting thru; he was going to take me with him. And then he falls down there, and he breaks his leg. And I go down to help him, and there's a lot of books down in this hole, incidentally. And somehow or other we end up in a sort of precarious position, perched up on some walls around this opening, and this whole location later shifts to higher up on the church. And I'm supporting him so he won't fall, and I'm trying to call for help. And he has turned into a Negro, and people who pass by outside are turning into Negroes instead of Indians. And he's still a priest. And finally we're able to attract help by hollering for it fairly loudly, so that the children and their teacher who are in school in part of the church below hear us. And before rescue quite comes, our position is less precarious, and I'm going to take some of the bandages off the priest's foot that I had put there. But instead, he takes the bandages off my feet where they had been, and he had supposedly put them there, although I didn't remember it, because of some sort of soreness or something I'd had. So somehow we have both been cured. An additional note on this first dream. It seems, once I was talking to this priest, that this cache of food and stuff buried under the cabin had been put there by the Indians rather than us, as some sort of a magical ritual, and that we'd made something of a mistake in keeping them away from it. That's all."

Sort of a combination of hypnotism, and I had started sort of a general discussion, and oh, a dozen people had expressed opinions or asked questions. And since I was supposed to be providing the information, I'd taken some notes on what these were so I could talk about it. And I stopped everybody and tried to reply to all these questions while I still could remember them reasonably well from my notes. Then I ended up in another corner of the room, sitting behind somebody who was talking very loudly, such that I couldn't hear what was going on and the other people couldn't hear me. And so I told him to be quiet, and he became quite belligerent, and slapped me. So I slapped him back. I sort of thought in the dream that this was a sign of maturity or something, since I could fight physical violence with physical violence, fight back without any fear, such as had always characterized me. And then there were some rather vague parts in this dream. One thing that strikes me is that I had to put on a pair of Bermuda shorts to go home, and the shorts very strange because they had four holes for legs. And there was a great deal of confusion in the dream as to whether these were male shorts or female shorts. But I eventually did get them on, first wondering whether to put my legs through the outside -- well, first I put my legs thru the inside pair of holes, but I thought the outside pants holes looked awfully funny, so then I put my legs thru the outside ones, and let the inside ones hang between my legs."

I think I should stay, even if I am conspicuous, so I sit down in the back room, just sort of watching the service through the door. I sit down beside a bunch of girls and other younger people. And I still feel somewhat conspicuous. And the girls - teenage girls, I guess - I'm sitting beside, seem to be the witches for the church. And so finally I go get a robe and a small pointed cap, put that on my head and sit down beside them, and I'm a witch, like them. And some people come in from the stairs and they're kind of surprised that I'm a witch, but they accept it. And I'm sitting there thinking when I'm wearing this tall witches' cap and everything, I seem to be very powerful. Then there's a confused scene. And then I'm peddling my bicycle up the hill away fro the church along with a couple of other people. Then another ambiguous transition. And then I and this girl are sitting up on top of this roof, sloping roof. And there's an alley down below. And I think the building we're on is a garage. And she's dressed, but her blouse is open, and I'm fondling one of her breasts. And then there's another girl down in the alley below, and I help her climb up onto the roof. And it's a little precarious, but I grab her hand as soon as she can climb up a little bit so she can get up, and at one point her arm seems to be awfully long. But once she gets up there, she's a very nice girl, and we go back over to where the other one was. And then there's some more parts I don't remember, and I'm back with just this one girl who climbed up on the roof now. And it seems that she and I are both in our teens, about 16 or something like that. And we've been bumming around the country together for several months, and living and loving together. And now we're on a train, which is heading toward Harvard Square in Boston. And we've been traveling like this on trains for some time, I think. And anyway, I'm inside the train, but she's up on top of the roof, because neither one of us has paid our fare. And I'm trying to get back up on the roof with her, but I don't want to be seen by the conductor or anybody. I don't want to be conspicuous so they'll ask me for my ticket. And I walk to the back of the train and stand at the doors of the last car at the very back, and want to go out through them. But there's sort of a little refreshment stand there with the conductor and some sort of train personnel in it, so I can't very well do that. Eventually the train stops at some stop and most of the people get off. It's sort of a cross between a train and a trolley now. And I think that perhaps I'll go outside and climb up the side of the car and get on, but it's too crowded a stop. People would be sure to see me. But then somehow my girlfriend has gotten in the train herself, which is much more like a trolley now. And we sit together in one of the seats in the almost empty car and we're necking quite passionately, but then the lights brighten again and the train is set to go on. And so we stop, because it's not legal to neck on trolleys in Boston. And so we go on in and get off at Harvard Square. And we go into some sort of dive somewhere where we can get something to eat real cheap because we have hardly any money. And there's some confusion about what I'm drinking. It seems to be a mixture of milk and beer. And then we picked up a third friend somehow, and all of us go over to see some sort of game - I don't know whether it was football or basketball or what - between Harvard and M.I.T. And I wondered about which side I should root for. And the dream seems to fade out about there."

And there are three other people there, and I am the fourth person coming. And these are friends of mine, and they've been expecting me. And I'm wearing a pair of shorts that has a couple of big holes in it near the anus and crotch. One of the people there is my mother, and I'm upset, but also amused, that my pants are so ragged. Also my friends are amused. when I get there, I have to crawl through a little opening to get into the cabin. And then there's parts that I don't recall, and then we're discussing an invention that a friend of mine has made. The people there now seem to consist of this man and his wife, and the man is later identified as Jung, and myself and another female. And Jung, although he's not called that yet, has invented something which looks like a tuning fork, except he's changed all the molecules in it, so it will act as the key to power some sort of machine that will slip from universe to universe. And he's careful not to let anybody else get ahold of it, this key, because it could be misused. Then there's some part about my identity now being that of a young girl, and then identifying with my young brother, or looking for someone vaguely identified as my father. And we follow him in this machine and finally find him, and give him to Jung, who takes him into the house. Oh, before this, I should mention that one of the first things I did on coming to the house was go to the observation platform on top. And I was looking at the beauty of the mountains all around us. And then I was rather amazed when I looked in one direction to see a city which was identified as Charlotte, North Carolina, and I was amazed that we were so close to the city and so far up in the mountains. Oh, also this other couple as sort of tentatively identified as Bob and Jean Crosse before he became Jung. Anyway, we gave this person who might have been my father to Jung and I was pushing on the brake of the machine to keep it from going anywhere, since it was parked on a hill, sort of like a car. And then my little brother and I got into the machine, because it started moving off through the air and back again as if it were phasing back and forth between this world and the one we had come from. Then there is some other action I don't remember, and two final things -- one, that Jung destroyed the key somehow, turned it back into ordinary metal. And two, that Jung was explaining to me how tremendous power of the things he'd discovered and how dangerous it was. And I had a sudden feeling of fear just sweep over me, as I'd started to come in contact with these things. And this fear woke me up, and yet at the same time in a way I was curiously aloof from this fear. I was afraid, but my curiosity and my determination to overcome it were also very strong. And this did wake me up -- ruminating about it half-awake there. That's all I can recall. It would seem I've forgotten a good deal of the details of this."

            "content": "Dream which seemed of unusual significance (typed immediately after waking). First recallable facts are these: this town had been flooded a year or so ago, with much loss of life, and the water still covered most of the town up to the first story of buildings. At this main intersection of the town there was a hole that water flowed out thru (although later in the dream it also seemed as if the water came from this hole), but id didn't drain off enough to lower the level. It did drain enough to create a small whirlpool there, and in an earlier dream episode I, or perhaps a friend of mine, had been caught in it in a small boat and been sucked down, either escaping narrowly, or been killed. Anyway, I had now constructed a special boat, which was very wide and flat, and powered by six outboard motors. It had a device which would throw sticks of dynamite into the water in a precise sequence, and I and my expedition of several other people were going to stop over or beside the drain and so enlarge it, thus draining the town. We had to be careful not to blow too large a hole and endanger ourselves, though. We got the boat beside the whirlpool and released some dynamite, but without accomplishing our purpose. Then after indeterminate action, we were in a different part of town, where the water did not reach because it was higher ground. Some sort of spell had been cast over us because the town seemed as alive as it had been before the flood, and we saw and talked to friends who had been drowned at that time, being very glad and not realizing we were under a \"spell\" of some sort. We were gradually led toward the flooded areas without realizing it, and had walked into the water almost up to our faces when I or someone suddenly realized that we would be drowned if we walked any farther. Although it wasn't normally noticeable, and you couldn't see it, if you set your mind to it, you could become aware of a subtle, chilly feeling that the water around your body caused. So we hastily got back out of the water, and I think a great deal of the illusion of the town being peopled, active, etc. disappeared as we did so. The illusion returned in most of the following, intermittent episodes, however, although I (we) often distrusted our sensations of this. Memory fades out as to exactly what happens next. However, the above seems like only a small fraction of the total dream. There were numerous times when I partially awoke, realized I was dreaming, in order to solve a very important problem concerned with the flooding of this town and the sinister forces that were trying to drown or otherwise capture me and my expedition. They did get  number of people from my expedition, and almost got me several times. I was constantly alert to the water sensation, and constantly trying to figure out just what it was I should do to save the situation. This took the ideas of continuing with the idea of enlarging the drain hole via an explosion, just looking for something in general (I don't know what), or blowing up a sport shop in the center of the flooded district where the sinister forces seemed to emanate from or be associated with. One of the fragments in here I recall is being attacked by half a dozen \"people,\" directed by a general of the \"opposition.\" These people had been drowned during the flood, but were animated by the sinister forces. They tried to drag me deeper into the water, but I got away from them. Individually, they were rather weak, but half a dozen of them were pretty formidable. Also, they lost their strength if they were out of the water, and it was in the water that the sinister forces were concentrated. Then I talked to the \"general,\" who seemed a very cultured and aristocratic gentleman. I don't know what we talked about, but it might have been something about stopping these illusions and fighting out in the open. Even as we talked, this general tried to trick me into going deeper in the water. At other times in these intermediate episodes, I thought that perhaps the best thing would be to drown, surrender to the enemy, as it might be that these were just spirits surviving death, and then I would be with all my friends who had been drowned. In another intermediate episode, the sport shop seemed to have become a giant mushroom, 20 or 30 feet high, but it quickly went back to a sport shop, and I don't recall what I was going to do while it was a mushroom. There were a number of other intermediate episodes that I don't recall at all. I call them episodes because I think I woke up partially in between each one. In at least one of these episodes, I was partially awake in the dream, for I knew I was lying in bed dreaming, yet I could see the dream scenery (the town) (although it wasn't as intense then), but knew I should go back and continue with the dream, continue looking for a solution. The last dreaming I recall before awakening takes place, I believe, still in this town. The sinister forces have become mainly personified in the person of a young woman who is a witch of some sort. Not ugly, but a nice-looking woman. I have been wandering around this town, carrying something in my hand that looks like a bicycle generator, a metal case with a small wheel on one end, similar to the one Ben Haimel gave me before we left for California. I accidentally discover that giving the wheel a twirl in one direction along the ground will make me invisible to all the people around me, while twirling it the other way returned my visibility. I wander around among the people some, testing my invisibility by bumping them, and thus becoming assured that I really am invisible. I think a thought struck me in the dream that the people were illusory anyway, the product of the spell, and by becoming invisible I could not be affected by the spell. I get on a bicycle (which becomes invisible as I get on), a very large bicycle, and start riding around. The witch drives by in her station wagon and, although she can't quite see me, she does sense me somehow, and drives after me, but I drive through some narrow spaces where a car can't follow and lose her. I then start riding out of town, fearing that she would be more likely to find me if I stayed in town, and anxious to find my friends so we may plan how best to use this invisibility to fight again the sinister forces. I think I am awakened at this point. Note that my wife remembers a dream revolving around trouble with the water supply (a shortage) in a town. Note that over the past few days I have been intermittently thinking about how to initiate a program of spiritual development, to become as intensely interested in spiritual things as I was years ago. I have been trying simple breathing exercises, which have been frustrating, as my lung capacity isn't what it used to be."

There someone told me about or let me read the newspaper account about what had happened to my wife, sort of a gentle way of breaking it to me. I started living (dreaming) this as I read it. She had been examined by a MD for something, and as we were waling back thru the corridors of this big institution, it was discovered that he had left his flashlight in her! I rushed her back. It seemed such a stupid thing, and yet I worried. The MD and several others examined her, and it seemed the flashlight had lodged in her abdomen or chest, with parts scattered thru her body. It was very serious and I had to leave the operating room while they operated. She called out to me while they were operating, and I argued with the nurse that they should have an intercom so husbands could comfort their wives during operations. The nurse told me I could do this by going in the operating room. I said no, it obviously wasn't allowed, but she insisted it was, as long as my fingers weren't crossed! It seemed stupid to me. The dream then gets confused, with some sort of scene where the doctors have gotten some parts of the flashlight out, but can't get them all, and my wife will never be quite right again, always an invalid. But somehow it's back at the party and I meet her and she's OK because the story was really about some other woman in Canada with the same name.. I then get involved with arguments about something else at the party. I then become half awake and realize I'm trying to curl around my wife, who is pushing my hand off her belly, and turn over away from her. She then called my name and woke me, telling me her stomach was all knotted up in cramps, she felt miserable, and the room reeked of stale cigarettes (it doesn't, as there's been no smoking in the house). I tried to figure out some way to help her, finally thought of some Compagine, got it out of the medicine chest, but suggested that she throw up first. She did and I went back to bed, and only then did the similarity of my dream hit me, so I got up (although body wanting to sleep) and wrote this before telling her anything more than that I had a psychic dream. Now to get her to write an independent account. She doesn't feel up to writing. Says she tossed and turned in bed, woke up, realized she felt sick, got up and went to bathroom while ½ asleep, came back to bed, then woke me a few minutes later -- moved a few times before waking me. She says \"flashlight\" (it was a penlight and later a full-sized flashlight in my dream) seems to ring a bell with her, but she doesn't know why."

Now reminds me of the driveway at Big Sur Hot Springs, although it didn't in the dream. I was down at the bottom as they were getting ready for the races. Each \"car\" would go down individually and be timed. One that went down looked like it had been made from a gas cylinder. Painted bright yellow. A friend of the drivers at the top was taking a movie of his going down with a weird camera, built in the end of a long yellow pole. I had just climbed to the top of the hill alongside the driveway and had to duck past this camera boom. I noticed that the end of the pole toward me had a human foot sticking out of it to stabilize it, which struck me as strange. Then I met some girl at the top of the hill whom I had met in an earlier dream tonight. She had sort of snubbed me in the earlier dream; now she was friendly and we made a date. She invited me over to her apartment. I then had some thoughts about how I was going to have an apartment of my own soon as I went off to college, instead of living with my parents (or was it roommates?). Something I can't recall now about time dilation and expansion. Somewhere in an earlier part we met Arlene & Bob Morel, who were going to play poker with us (I had talked about playing poker with Arlene yesterday). Also some vague memory back then about meeting some girl to play games, but really to try to seduce her."

One couple is bold, extraverted, perhaps the \"unknown couple\" of previous night's dream, but I'm not sure. Something was different about them. They are introducing us to the second couple, who are very different -- I say \"us,\" although I don't recall my wife actually being in the dream. The first couple has some sorts of roses or similar flower in boxes, which is needed by us. The second couple has a different, smaller kind of flower, more of them than the roses. The combination of these is very adequate for whatever we need them for. There was a good deal about this, but I don't recall most of it. Then a second episode, centering around a couple that I think is the same as the above shy couple. We are to meet them. I am standing at a bar in NYC with the wife, who is naked, and I have my arm around her and one of my legs twined around her legs as we stand. I suppose I am naked, although I don't remember it. She is somewhat skinny, but generally attractive. Older too, I think. Then her husband comes up and tells me to let go of his wife. He is a short, thin man with a crew cut and a rather mousy look. Now somehow, Andriga Puhari has gotten in the dream and is with me. I let go of the wife, and identify with Puhar, who makes a very skillful apology, which ends up being a written apology on a letter he puts on the bar. I add a letter of my own, much shorter, in which I concur with the apology, and mention I just have a habit of curling around women, like my father, Puhar. The husband is mollified. Forgotten episodes. Then things are still in NYC, but have taken on a Victorian character in the way people dress and the city looks. Something about trying to meet Puhar for lunch, but having difficulty finding him in the crowd. Then I am at home in NYC, a rather fine house I seem to own, and I seem to be a gentleman of sorts. I am sitting on my porch reading a newspaper, while a servant is trimming the hedge and flowers. The mousy husband rides up on a strange bicycle. It has 3 wheels and a very plush seat -- reminds me of a rickshaw bike, except that he sits in the plush seat and peddles too. He is unhappy about something. We talk, I don't recall about what. I think he is worried about his wife. Then he rides off, and I decide he is despondent-looking enough that I'd better follow him - he might suicide. So I follow on a similar bike, my servant looking surprised that I'm suddenly leaving. I catch up to him at a pier where a pleasure ship has just disembarked. He finds his wife on it, when he thinks she has been working all day. He may suicide or something -- I don't recall -- but he is pretty shaken up over it. The wife knows he's upset, but tells me how she needed to get away for a while, and that she only had 5 beers during the day. Obviously she has been making love with some of the men on the ship too. Forgotten parts. Then Puhar and I are trying to find the proper train to my homeetown, while a porter is calling out a commercial that flying is the best way to go anywhere. Fades out into confusion.

As we run out of the throne room, we are shot at with various energy weapons, but missed, although I think (not actually perceive) in the dream that great sections of the walls are blasted away. We dodge through corridors where there is much fighting -- our escape has started this. We go down some very crowded stairs. Some sort of slave class has now been persuaded to fight on our side, and is swarming up the stairs. We go underground to the subways. It seems that this place is NYC. Then all sorts of riding through subway tunnels, occasionally coming above ground for a few minutes. Finally we are riding in a steam-powered car, and have gotten about 850 miles from NYC. We crossed under the Hudson on a forgotten underground railway tunnel, which only came to the surface for a brief moment in the middle of the river. The steam car we are riding in now looks sort of like a trolley. We are suspicious of the few other cars we see, as they may be occupied by alien patrols, but none of them spot us. The roads have gone to pot since the aliens have taken over, and we help some people whose car is stuck in the snow. Finally we arrive at a small town which is our destination, as up on the snow-covered mountainside is a ruined castle which is a secret headquarters for the liberation movement, and they will now be very glad I have brought this person there. A man comes down the mountainside to meet us, a wise-looking, gray-haired man. That's all I recall. Thoughts on interpretation: my wife was very hateful and petty last night about Lil .... why do I have a female friend she hasn't met, etc. In the dream: my wife is the alien queen, who I must escape from via mechanical gadgets, taking a very important person (my inner self) underground, hidden, trying to get to a distant point where I (we) can come up again. Yet there is a curious sense of disappointment when we arrive at the final goal, although not too strong. Who is the gray-haired man? Are the energy weapons the blasts of hate my wife sends out when she gets like she was last night? Representing her as a queen is appropriate because of the emotional power she has over me."

One of my companions was a Negro, and I identified with him at this point, although I gradually and imperceptibly shifted back to myself somewhere along the line. After giving the last companion his lid, I hid mine in a hole in the wall outside my apartment, as I was worried about being followed by crooks who might steal my lid. Sure enough, three big, burly, muscular crooks chased me through the streets. Somewhere here I acquired an indistinct companion, perhaps my Negro companion. We dashed into the water and swam out to and sat on a fallen tree. The three crooks went out on a point about 100' away. One tried to swim toward us, but I hooked him with some fishing line and a hook, and kept him from getting too close. While I was doing this, the other two crooks had swum underwater (I hadn't thought they could swim) under our tree and tried to grab us, but we managed to dive into the water and get away again. The next scene takes place at home, with my wife in the house. The three crooks are prowling about outside, and seem to be invisible, since they can rattle the doors without being seen. I lock the back and front doors and, noticing that they are shaking the bedroom door, get my .22 pistol from the drawer and start trying to shoot them. They become visible during this action. My pistol won't shoot; it emits little puffs of smoke and flame, sometimes, but despite my repeatedly pulling the trigger, it won't shoot. Luckily the police come about this time and arrest the crooks (not me, as I no longer recall the bank robbery). I resolve to go right down to Alec's and get a reliable, bigger caliber pistol. There was another long dream after this, concerning making something or advising people to do something which would result in the cigarette companies suing me, according to Bob Liebt, but that's all I can recall of it."

I, a faithful male companion, and my family (mother, brothers, sisters, father) are in our fortified home in a small village in somewhere. My father is some kind of noble who is also a scientist, but the villagers fear and hate him. Sort of a Baron Frankenstein setting. The villagers attack the house, wanting to destroy it and us. We fight them off, although it is close. I feel they are unjustified, ignorant fools, and have a continual feeling of \"Why won't they leave us alone?\" There is one person in particular who is attacking us who is very dangerous, and we fear him as well as very much wanting to destroy him, although I don't recall exactly who he is, and he may even be something of a supernatural being. My companion and I flee the house. I think my father (not my real-life father, of course, not my real-life family) wants us away before the next attack. There is a relatively peaceful interlude in which my companion and myself act as if we were Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, and we assemble a model train set on a grassy hillside and play with it. A rather modern, plastic set. But then somehow we know the enemy is following, and we end up being in my father's other laboratory out in the woods. This is a stone fortified building with a tower, etc. -- more good Baron von Frankenstein type settings. We were supposed to go here. Then we hear kids from the village coming, and must do something to keep them from getting the keys which are in the locks of the outer doors, on rings. I then think about (rather than actually experience) leaping out into the night, knocking down the boys, and snatching away the keys. We quickly lock the doors, for now soldiers from the village (or at least armed villagers) are coming, as well as the feared enemy person, who is particularly fearful to us boys. There is a lot of action I don't recall about running around inside the place, defending it, while the soldiers are trying to break down the door. Somehow a tall, black-haired girl whom I love has been inside with us, a sort of princess. Somehow she gets killed by having her head cut off with a broadsword, and I don't know whether it was the attackers who did it, or whether I myself had to slay my love to protect her from something worse. Anyway, I'm quite upset over it. We finally realize we can't defend the place much longer and must flee. Somehow a body has been burnt on one of the lab tables, but if the villagers know about it, they will be sure to kill my family. It is a body of one of the attackers, one of them, I guess. So we get another body, the cadaver of some tramp, from a closet and put it on the table ... my father, the Baron, apparently kept bodies around for his experiments. Then my companion points out in alarm that we can't leave the head of my beloved princess around because that will really infuriate the villagers when they break in, as she was such an important person. So he finds some kind of headpiece or crown for it, then I throw the head in the furnace to completely destroy it, weeping as I do so at this act. In the next scene the villagers break into the lab and find it empty, and the back doors open onto the night. My companion and I have fled. Many of the villagers are women, carrying swords, and very bloodthirsty. We are lying in the foggy night in some bushes just in back of the lab. A huge search goes on, with villagers almost stumbling over us, but we remain undiscovered. One comes so close he will discover us, so I cut him down with my sword and change clothes with him so we can slip away unrecognized. We slip away from the soldiers and thru the dark woods. Finally we leap over a \"stream\" of flowing, glowing, colored mist (I forget the color) and run up the stairs of a magical tower, another of my father's strongholds. We run up the circular stairs to the very top where the roof is solid over us, and there seems to be no way out. The place is well lighted inside, although I don't recall any lights. We flee rapidly up to the top, because the enemy, the supernatural one, is following us. As we flee up the stairs, we have become glowing mists ourselves - I a red one, and my companion a yellow one. Behind us the enemy being, now a green mist, is coming up the stairs. In the last scene before being awakened by our daughter coming back into the room, I am leaning over the rail, sword in hand, waiting to attack the green mist, fearful, yet triumphant that I will finally have a chance to destroy this dreadful enemy. I was also lamenting to my companion as we went up the stairs that all my love and goodness had changed to hate and revenge, that I was a doomed and driven man. What a place to be awakened at! This was a vivid dream in which I felt strong emotions. The only element I can trace to day residue off-hand is hearing Barbara sing \"The Brown Girl and Fair Eleanor\" on tape at lunch yesterday, in which the b___ cuts off the brown girl's and Eleanor's heads, although he loves them both. I was completely the Baron's son (about 15, I guess) in this dream, not myself at all, which is unusual. In some ways it's as if this were someone else's dream from another time. Inspired by talking about ESP and Bridy Murphy with Leslie LeCron last night?"

We got some sorts of ice cream cones at a stand on the street (except both chunks of ice cream came out of some sort of bottle) and then went upstairs (3rd story) to his apartment (his parents' apartment for a while, as we seemed kids). He seemed to have quite a bit of $ and a fancy apartment, with castle-like attributes. He was showing me around. There was a woman there who was his mistress. We all watched some people in the next apartment (which looked like a window in a cliff) do some rock climbing up and down their wall. The place seemed to be a tower now, and I was suggesting to Buddy that he needed some colored floodlights in the most to make it look pretty at night. Buddy goes off somewhere, I am staying at his apartment several days. I am not sure whether his mistress stays. I have a fantasy in the dream (with some reality to it, but not much) about going out with some prostitute for sex, but finding it dissatisfying. There was a recurrent theme through much of the night's earlier dreaming. I and my wife would be with some other couple for both social and therapeutic reasons, and there's always something written out which I should do to get things going according to the program, but I never quite get a good look at the program or remember what it is I'm supposed to do...."

There is symbolism of a big tank of water being unbalanced because it is not sitting on a level surface and this is threatening, as it is dangerous if it tips. This seems symbolic somehow of getting involved in the wrong way. This theme of failing to get acquainted on a real personal level was apparently repeated in several dreams of the night -- I felt this in the dream, and possibly also felt that this was a very old theme of mine. There was also a fragment just before waking concerning some kind of prediction about our daughter's health, a dire prediction, but one that was not likely to come out. (Probably from day residue of our daughter cutting her lip badly last night.) This theme of failing to get to know another person or couple because of getting involved in trivia or \"scientific\" matters is one that has occurred in earlier dreams.

The next two incidents seem part of the same dream, although they are conceptually distinct. The last dream of the night, but I'm not sure which series came first, although I suspect the ticket one. I was driving along in a dual-control car. Harry Groddy was in the regular driver's seat, but I was driving from the other seat. We were driving along S. Broad St., where it is 4 lanes, in my hometown, behind another car that was going slowly, and I decided to pass, but seeing a policeman riding a motorcycle in front of the car, I changed my mind. The policeman waved me over and was giving me a ticket anyway, and I was arguing that I had probably not even accelerated to 40 in this 35-mile zone, and Harry backed me up. Why didn't he give a ticket to the guy who was following him too closely, instead of me? But he gave me the ticket anyway. The other series: There had been some sort of explosion in this big pit in Woodside, and I and others were investigating, particularly to see if it was radioactive. We started out in a bus. Then there was this interpolated incident, where I was at some place at the beach, watching the waves, and how this boat dock seemed to have been damaged by the waves. Then back on the bus, coming back from our investigation. There was no radioactivity involved. Nevertheless, some policemen were meeting the bus and going to arrest us, or at least escort us somewhere, because people thought we were behind the damage or explosion."

I feel sort of rejected, but am trying to control the feeling. There turns out to be room in the back, though. I associate the jeep's driver with either Carl Jobelli, Paul Diller's family, or Randy and Jimmy. I sit on a rather small boy's lap as we ride, and this boy seems to be someone like Bobby Mathison or Buddy Krone's younger brother. I wonder about homosexual connotations of sitting on this boy's lap, but nothing happens. Then I am in an apartment that is mine, with my wife. The apartment seems associated with my past, but  Barbara and John are visiting us. They are not married, and both seem very young, around 12 or so, but sexually developed for their age. In some sense I associate John with Buddy Krone's younger brother, and I remember thinking (probably with a twinge of jealousy) that he is engaging in really advanced sexual activity for his age. Anyway, John and Barbara hug and kiss a lot, and I wonder if we should be responsible for stopping them, but don't really care. I am hugging my wife and mainly curling up with my head on her, and it's very sweet. Barbara and John go off into the bedroom, but I don't think they have intercourse. I do catch a glimpse of John, naked, getting out of bed later to go to the bathroom, but Barbara is not with him. Then I am in the bedroom and I'm going to show the Tarot to Barbara and John, who have never seen it. Some other persons may be there too, but I don't recall. I have to peel off a stack of cards at one end that have directions on using the Tarot to tell about people's previous incarnations, and, in passing, wonder if we should try that system. I have difficulty shuffling the deck, and at one point they seem like a series of small booklets rather than cards. In the next part of the dream I recall, we (my wife, Barbara, John and me) have arrived on a rooftop from which hikes start into the woods, and the guide and people on the last hike are just returning up the stairs that go down into the woods. I vaguely recall this building being somewhere earlier in the dream, and we had decided not to go to it because we didn't have a car with us, and cars were necessary for the trip that started from there. Interpretive Notes: Last night went to the local Spiritualist Church with my wife, Jeff Sims, and Joann Hotelling. Felt a little awkward at the service because I wasn't really participating in it. Got a message of generalities and good advice from one medium. Went to bed last night very tired, but \"stirred up\" in unknown way inside, expected to sleep late today and not try to record dream, but above is one of the clearest recalled in long while. May reflect early church attitudes, guilt over lack of religion."

In the first episode I clearly remember, my brother, I, and the enemy general are standing on top of a hill of ash and rubble, watching the enemy troops in the town below. Technically we are prisoners. My brother volunteers to go get some personal possession of the enemy general's, which he has left in his black convertible, parked a little ways below us on the hillside. Instead, he leaps into the car and dashes off down the hill. The guards fire at him with tommy-guns, but miss. He drives wildly into the enemy traffic below and escapes. Later I have persuaded the enemy general that I'm apologetic about my brother's actions, and want to go find him and bring him back. All thru this dream I use our friendship to trick the enemy so we may re-win the country, but I have no hard feelings against them -- I really do feel friendly toward them, as does my family. Anyway, the enemy general agrees, and I want some sort of pass so the enemy soldiers won't pick me up if I start wandering around. He offers to give me a child's pocketbook, which has bright mosaic patterns on the side, but I argue that's silly, and want a written pass of free conduct. I eventually make something like that myself. Next scene is at my family's house, where one of the enemy generals is staying over for lunch or the like.

But he had hooked up an extension phone he owns (illegally, or course) and found the line still live, so he could call out. I started to warn him that he had better be sure to disconnect his phone before the phone company repairmen came out, when the following dream came back to me. In the dream I was in a house (don't know what house) in which the phones (a master and at least one extension -- don't recall how many extensions or whether it was just one) were not working. They were broken or disconnected, or something like that. I or someone (don't recall exactly) had illegally hooked my (their) own phone set up to the lines, and that worked OK. But I was thinking to myself, or warning someone else (not sure which) to disconnect it before the repairmen came. I cannot see any reason for dreaming about telephones in terms of day residue.

I wander off a side path that leads toward a redwood, and this completely changes the dream. I am beside a bay of the sea. The bay has partially flooded this slum area of the city. As I watch, a large, brown whale swims in right beside the old, deserted slum houses. Then I float around this bay on an air mattress. The water gets rough at several places, and I almost fall off the mattress. I worry about being swept too far out to sea, or out to where the whales are, but it doesn't happen. The slum buildings are no longer deserted, but are lived in by slum dwellers, who are controlled to a great extent by a crooked politician-gangster. I seem to be a doctor, now, who is also doing a little surreptitious investigation of the whole setup. I, and a companion I don't remember, were looking around the area, but trying to be inconspicuous. Somehow we are arrested and jailed in this old building where I perform some sort of medical duties on a sick man. I get out somehow, but almost get lost getting out of the building, for it has many doors and it is confusing. Now the crooked politician has one of his strong-arm boys watching me, as well as eavesdropping occasionally himself. I am talking to a secretary (who seems to be Arlene Morgel) who works there in the area, perhaps for him. I pretend to be a reporter, just collecting human interest material on the boss. I ask about how he perhaps came up from a poor, slum background to be a successful leader, etc., etc., to impress the boss who may be listening. I think the secretary knows I am faking all this too. The boss's name is Mr. Bowpas, or Baupas. I woke up at this point and made some notes. Then fell back to sleep and dreamed a completion. The secret, illegal way in which Mr. Bowpas was making his money was by manufacturing and selling ice cream (strawberry) in a factory that was hidden under the water of the bay. I pictured a big cask under the bay when I thought of the factory. The dream now takes a more international turn, as if this were a small country instead of just a slum ward, and I dream that the new prime minister is revealing this illegal activity and not letting it go on, although he could have taken it over for himself, as many politicians in the past had done."

Then there is something unclear to the effect that some sort of hosing down of me every few minutes would also cure me, but I again argue that I can't keep popping out of this party to be hosed down in the courtyard. Then there is a gap in my memory, and the next thing I recall is that I'm about to marry some girl. I am using an assumed name, though, as if I'm wanted by the police for something. We are having a picture taken by this couple who does photography commercially, sort of at a fair. This couple looks very much like us. He knows who I really am, and while getting ready to take the picture of my bride-to-be and myself, says that he won't take it, just pretend to, but he will give us separate pictures which we must pretend are the picture of us together. He then calls me Melvin, indicating he knows who I really am, and I run off to escape from the police, who now are chasing me. A cartoon quality about this scene: I have run into a supermarket, gotten in by means of a chute. As police slide down the chute after me, they fall into a large grocery bag, which moves away on a conveyor belt. Now in the dream I and several companions are reading a series of cartoons about Donald Duck. Each one of the sequence is on a different can of frozen orange juice, and as the cans are not in order in the frozen food case, it's quite a job to follow these cartoons. I eat some ice from the case. Then I take some cans over to our cart, as now this dream is about my wife and I shopping in a supermarket we've never been in before. I notice that there are many interesting products in this market I've never seen before, and want to look around. I have also bought my wife a can of Salems, and am a little surprised at myself, but rationalize that this will be a good way for her to take them on a camping trip. I put a large piece of ice back in the frozen foods case, as it's more than I can eat. Interpretive note: I woke up with considerable phlegm in my throat."

This recalled a fragment of a dream last night in which David had had a bowel movement in his diapers. I can still see the scene, with David having smeared feces from his diapers onto the front of his belly and onto his chest, near the armpits. Someone else in the dream (I don't recall who) and I were remarking that this was a new phase for David, to be so terribly messy as this. David had actually smeared feces all over himself and his crib when my wife went in this morning. I think the coincidence of the dream and event is significant. I almost never dream of David, that I recall, and do not believe I have ever dreamed of him having dirty diapers. Two explanations are possible. One is some sort of telepathy or clairvoyance. The other is subliminal perception and subsequent stimulus incorporation. Twice I got out of bed last night to see why David was crying so -- each time I gave him a bottle. I have no conscious recollection at all of the bed having been smeared, or David smelling dirty (he always smells a little uriney at night), but perhaps he was.... my wife tells me that a long time after my second trip to David (around midnight was my trip, she thinks), she had to get up to tuck our daughter in. She had climbed into our bed and my wife had later sent her back, and when she cried, had gone to tuck her in. Anyway, my wife doesn't remember David smelling dirty, and this was considerably later than my visit. Another possibility is that the smell spread through the house and affected my dream. I don't know how plausible this is. Certainly David's room smelled pretty nasty while my wife was changing him, but I did not consciously smell it in our room or the living room when I got up. A psychological factor: I had played with David a lot yesterday, and thus was closer to him than usual."

They do this, but as the servant is watching them, I jump him and, with the help of soldiers I call for, finally subdue him. His arm breaks in the process and as he is in too much pain to be questioned, I rub some anesthetic liquid on it, but threaten him not to renew the treatment if he doesn't talk. He tells us something (I don't recall what) about how to capture the witch, so a group of us set off. Upstairs someone glimpses the witch climbing some spiral stairs into a tower. The group runs up, but I stay behind because I fear it may be a trap. I lean against the wall in the hall and a secret door opens, but I don't go into the dark passageway alone because I want to watch the stairs. Sure enough, the stairs swivel around so that my men can't get down them."

I am fearful about opening it, as I think it might be a ghost or some sort of harmful, supernatural creature. I kick the door more tightly closed. Finally I do open it, however, and discover a beautiful, sexy woman, wearing only some green panties. She is only about four feet tall, but very well built. We embrace, pet, and make love -- in the process, she gradually acquires full adult size. ... Many years later, with all sorts of intervening dream activity that I don't recall ... It is 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, quite dark outside. I am outside a school building that also seems to be a sort of hospital (in retrospect, it reminds me of Lalor School). There has been some sort of commotion, and all sorts of children and teachers are milling around outside the entrance. Finally most of the lights are turned off and everyone goes home. I am admitted to the school, even though it seems as if I really shouldn't be, by their rules, yet I deserve to be. I get in by telling the principal (who is just locking the door) that I must see the stray child they have just found, whose name is Barbara Sistrunk, because I knew her mother. (I am already sure that it was her mother that I loved in the bathroom many years ago.) I go upstairs, and now the school seems more like a hospital. I ask directions from a nurse, and she points out the ward where this girl is. I go in and see the girl sleeping on a bed. She seems to be somewhere between 6 and 9 years old. I look into her face, trying to recognize her and see the resemblance to her mother, whose face I barely remember, it has been so long. She wakes up and I apparently do recognize her. I am overcome by emotion and cry, and tell the girl that I knew her mother and I want to help her. Comments: I don't think that I was the father of the girl in the dream -- in the part I don't recall well, I may have seen a report about the girl's parents and what happened to them. Also, I seemed to be connected with this hospital, as if it were a scientific research institution that was particularly interested in working with people like this little girl. Don't recall whether she was supposed to possess special powers or not. Could the little girl and her mother be my anima? The dream refer to my early \"devotion\" to spiritual things, its loss, and my attempts now to regain it? I can think of no particular day residue for this except for the name Barbara Steistrand, which is that of a folk singer, and I've heard the name within the past few days."

            "content": "The first part of this dream that I recall is my making a bicycle trip from my hometown to somewhere in a nearby state, probably Willow Glen or that area (I have made a similar trip in many other dreams, but never in reality, as it is too far for a bicycle trip). It is a long trip, and I am tired, even though I have my present 3-speed English bike. Now it is dark outside (between 6 and 7 o'clock), and I have reached a small town, which I recall from previous dream trips is a place where several roads join, and I must be careful to take the right one. This decision has always been difficult before, but this time I just turn right up one road without worrying about it, and am pretty sure it is the right road. I ride up a very step hill, peddling in low gear, and almost being unable to make it. At the top I ride around a crowd of talking and cursing people who have had to stand there for a while until a train just went by (the railroad tracks cross the street). Suddenly I find a ten-dollar bill in my pocket. It must have come from the street or these people. At any rate, I decide to buy a used Volkswagen with it, and do so (memory for this indistinct -- I just seem to get in, in almost no time). I put the bicycle on the back, though, in case I need it later. Then I go into a bicycle store down the street, taking my bike in with me. I want to buy \"hub caps\" for the bike wheels, but the clerk tells me they don't have them. Leaving the bike store, I encounter some sort of ghost or evil spirit -- memory poor here -- I avoid this one and go down some stairs. At the bottom of the stairway there is a large garage door leading out, the kind that goes up. A terrible shock or pain hits me, however, as I wait, and I realize that these shocks come in 5 second bursts. I also discover that if you stand up with the pain, the duration of it increases. It is a vicious circle, for the standing up makes the pain longer, etc., and I realize the usual outcome is to kill you. I force myself to stay down, and after three shocks the garage door finally opens enough for me to get out. I meet some other kind of ghost or spirit on the way out, but don't recall this well. I drive on in the car and stop at a roadside place, again trying to find hub caps for the bicycle, and a new pair of slipper socks, but they have neither. Finally I reach my goal, a mountain. I climb it in the dark, and near the top, dig up the buried treasure I was looking for. The treasure is a conventional treasure chest full of jewelry, gold, etc. It seems I have been seeking this for some time. I hear voices -- a girl's and a man's -- coming up the mountain. There was a bottle of wine or brandy in the treasure chest, and I hold this like a club, ready to defend the treasure. As the girl and man come around a boulder, I recognize them for friends. It turns out that the girl and man are part of a secret organization possessed of various occult powers, and they actually inspired me to undertake this quest, and they put the various obstacles in my way as tests. Now that I have passed them, they accept me as a member of the Brotherhood. We hide the treasure in a new spot. I have found it, but it is also theirs, and at any rate, it must stay hidden for the time being. I recall putting a little strip of Dymo label material (brown) over the spot where it is buried. Then we all go back to town, but go through old mining tunnels. We come to the new headquarters of the Brotherhood, which has just been excavated. We inspect the many underground rooms. It seems that the place I work is quite close to here, and that I am to continue my normal role in life, with my work with the Brotherhood as a hidden role."

I was chased into a supermarket, and had already almost been gotten by them, for they had gotten something all over me that would destroy me, something like lots of tiny insects that would eat me. I knew there was a display of worms for fishing in this supermarket, though, so I ran back to it and the insects were attracted to the worms and so left me. The worms looked like wooden matches. I ran some of them through my hair and over my skin to draw the insects off -- they clung to the heads of the matches-worms, several to each one. I ran out of the supermarket, for the vampires were close behind me. They had put a snake-like thing on my car. It looked like a very long (8 feet or so) and oversized piece of magnetic tape, but its touch was poisonous. I managed to dodge around it and get in the car. A foot or so of it was inside, almost touching me, but I ran over the rest of it or something that weakened it enough so that I could open the door, which was slammed on it, and throw it outside. Then I drove away. I drove to this motel nearby. It was early evening now. I checked into an end room, for it was part of my plan to get the vampires outside this room. I knew in the morning that a laser beam swept the area in front of this room. Just as I locked myself in the room, the vampires came up outside. The beautiful woman, a companion that looked like a tall, thin, young man, and a child-like one (male, I think). They sat there through the night waiting for me. I got a good night's sleep, knowing they couldn't get in, but got up at dawn to go out. It was important that I expose myself to them, for otherwise, I couldn't get them in the right position for the laser beam to do its work. I managed to get them lined up in a column between the laser beam and me, but the first one, the woman, was very dangerous. Finally, the laser beam came on. It looked like it was coming from a phototube rather than any laser I've ever seen (including the laser I saw in the movie Goldfinger last night), and it swept back and forth over a 45-degree arc. I kept running and dodging, staying out of the beam myself, but keeping the vampires looking at me, so they wouldn't notice the thin, red beam. The child vampire was decapitated by the beam almost immediately (he was last in line). It took a couple of minutes before the male one was in the right place and then he was decapitated. The female was very difficult to get in the right place. This is why I thought she was like my wife. In order to stall her, I kept appealing to her to stop for the sake of our old love, etc., etc., as if she were my wife. Finally, the beam caught her and decapitated her. I thought what a mess this would seem to any passerby who didn't know they were vampires. As the dream ended, I was wondering whether the laser had been enough or whether I should put some stakes through their hearts before burying them."

It had been opened recently by some college girl and a friend of hers, ostensibly to pray in, but actually so they would have a place to have intercourse. I and assorted friends were investigating the place, however, because we suspected a vampire was living in it. We were searching through the church, looking behind doors. I saw some feet under a curtain, so I tackled the figure, but it turned out to be someone either neutral or on our side - I forget who. Then, while investigating the pulpit, I noticed a small hole in the wall, and decided that the vampire must live in that. We settled down to wait for night, in order to capture and kill the vampire so we could use the church. Meanwhile, we sang some hymns and occasionally I threw things at the hole up on the wall, trying to throw things inside it to disturb the vampire, but without success. Finally it was night, the sun down, and the vampire flew out of the hole. He was in the form of a little brown bat. He flew around and at us, and I was slashing at him with a sword. Finally my friend and I caught him, held him by his wingtips, and stabbed him frequently with our knives. The vampire said that we couldn't kill him that way, but we replied that we could mutilate and weaken him. We wanted to get him to change back into human form so we could keep better control over him, but he wouldn't. Finally we forced him into a small cardboard box and pinned him down in it. As the dream ended, it was near morning and we were discussing whether to just expose him to the sun in the morning and thus finish him off. I think that's what we decided to do."

            "content": "A Psychic Dream. On waking this morning, I remembered dreaming about my grandfather (maternal). I was very surprised at dreaming about him, as I don't believe I've dreamed of him in many years, and nothing had happened in my life lately that I can even remotely relate to my grandfather. I mentioned to my wife that I had dreamed of him. A few minutes ago (about 9:30pm) my mother called to tell me her insurance man had been by earlier this evening and told her that a $1000 endowment policy on me was just reaching term, and that they would send the policy to a local agent to pass on to me. It is worth several hundred dollars over the $1000 due to interest, and will be helpful when we are ready to make a down payment on a house. The policy was bought for me by my grandfather when I was about eight years old. Not until a few minutes after we finished talking did I suddenly make the connection between the dream of my grandfather and this sudden gift from my grandfather! Thus I add what I can recall of the dream, although most of it has been forgotten. .... I went into this shop which was my grandfather's. It seemed as if it had been changed, as if it wasn't the same as it was years ago. I thought that it had been something of a pawn shop, even though I also knew that my grandfather was a jeweler and watchmaker. I wanted to get a revolver that he had used to display (in the dream), in order to protect myself against roving hordes (I think the earlier part of the dream dealt with civilization decaying or some such common motif for my dreams). My grandfather was behind the counter, and I was greatly surprised to see him. I knew in the dream that I had not seen him for many years, although it did not occur to me that he had died (more than 10 years ago now, I guess). He had put the pistol in a drawer under the counter so that he could get at it if robbers came in. Strangely, the pistol was either made of gold or gold-plated, and so rather valuable. I don't remember for sure, but I think he finally gave me the pistol. I talked with him for a while, but I don't recall what about."

Many of us are whipping ropes around or helping others whip some around. The object is to catch and tame the camels (2-humped kind) corralled there. My grandfather is there. He is an old and apparently rather famous man, for people are concerned that he will overexert himself, or hurt himself. Many try to help him, as I do, and it is considered something of a privilege. He catches a camel, exercises it or something, and finally gets it to kneel down while he cleans it and rubs it down. This seems to be most of the taming job. Then he lies down to rest in a large, coffin-shaped box which is actually a hi-fi equipment cabinet. I am concerned about his dying, for he had exerted himself so much for his age. I am fooling around with a hasp that locks the box, as well as wondering if it could be used as a coffin if he died. I tell him to holler when he is through resting and wants out. He dies and does not answer. I open the box and see he has finally died, finally achieved his rest after a long, active, worthwhile life. He has apparently died only a minute ago and I wonder if I should try to revive him, but realize that it probably wouldn't work, and he deserves this final rest so much that it would be cruel. I tell my mother he is dead. I am quite unhappy, and crying. She wants me to call the undertaker. The coffin is being taken away on a train. The camel he tamed walks after the departing train, and I and the family (mother + unidentified people) walk alongside. It is a strange sight, and onlookers think it's not Christian. ... Then I and the family are in a compartment on the train going to wherever the final burial will be. The coffin is in the compartment with us. One of the members of the family is a teenage girl, the daughter (?), and she wants to get off for a while in NYC, but we won't let her. We remind her that grandfather (or was it me?) had said that NYC was to the country as the genitals were to the body ... the train was traveling north."

            "content": "An unusual dream experience to record. Fell back asleep this morning after my wife had gotten up. Sleeping on my stomach, an unusual position for me. I don't recall many details of the experience, but it involved a diffuse awareness of the fact that I was dreaming, that it was not an ordinary dream because the visual imagery was not as clear and far more subject to my will than an ordinary dream. An awareness that I could gradually shift my awareness over to actual bodily sensations and thus more toward wakefulness if I wished, but I did not do so until late in the experience. Continuous awareness of a \"body\" that was mine but which I knew was not my physical body or, at best, only a very indirect representation of it. My attempts in this state (which was not full consciousness) were a feeling of floating upward. I knew I was lying on my stomach, that this was an unfavorable position for projection according to Muldoon, but I tried anyway. My efforts could considerably increase feelings of lightness, but not break me free from my body. This was largely the first part of the experience. During this part I was only aware of myself and attempts to break free -- by and large, there was no \"dream environment\" that I could recall. In the latter half of the experience, I got into a dream environment, nebulously perceived as a rather featureless room. There was a female figure and a large, powerful male figure, both of which were relatively nebulous, as was the environment. I was aware of this thin quality of the characters and environment, and \"semi-consciously\" realized that this was all a symbolic environment of my creation, and that I would accept it for that and try to use it to have a projection. Thus I treated the male figure as a father figure and myself (also in a nebulous body) as a child playing with him, such that he would throw me upward. This produced appropriate \"somatic\" sensations of sailing up, but I considered them only symbolic, and dreamish, as there was not the sudden clearing of sight and vision of the real world that I expected to come with a genuine projection. There were sounds of some sort here, but I don't recall them, except to feel fairly certain they were not real world sounds coming through. After a while I tired of this latter sequence, feeling it just wasn't getting anywhere, so semi-volitionally I shifted my attention to real sensations of body in a gradual way until I was fully awake."
