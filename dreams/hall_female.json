            "content": "I dreamed that I was at a public affair but I don't know which affair it was although it was outdoors. There were many people around us and they were of all ages. I was at this affair with B. He is about twenty-six years old and he is the boy-friend of one of the girls that lives in the dormitory that I do. Whenever I felt the urge to get away from my escort or from the people at the affair, I would start to fly. (like superman). While up in the air I felt very uneasy and worried about how I would get back down without hurting myself. I left my escort about three times in this way. I do not remember why I felt that I had to get away. Interpretation I do not know why I would dream of B. I do not know him very well and I do not feel very friendly toward him when I do see him. I believe that I associated him with my studies and felt that I had to get away for a short while. When I had this dream, I hadn't been home for about eight weeks and was looking forward to going home. I felt that I wanted a short vacation from my studies and this dream was an escape mechanism in the form of a fantasy to get away from my classes for a short while. Answers to questions 2. Frustrated. I felt that I had to get away.3. actual participant4. unpleasant5. Vague, but it was outdoors.6. No.7. No."

            "content": "I dreamed that I was in the office of the directress or nurses in the nursing school. She is about forty-five years old. She told me the results of an I.Q. test which I had taken in a psychology class. [I really did not take this test.] The I.Q. for this test was 169. She told me that my I.Q. for the test I had taken in the nursing school was only 80. She said that if I had made a higher score in the nursing test I would have received more credit hours for the training that I received from my hospital at home. [I did take a nursing pre-entrance examination. This test determines the number of credit hours that a nurse receives for her student training when she enters the graduate school.] Interpretation This dream is probably a form of wishful thinking. I would like to receive as many credits as possible for my student training. I did not know the results of the examination at the time of the dream. I had been thinking about the examination that day and I wanted to know about the results of the test. Answers to questions 2.

I had previously read in a newspaper that you do not receive any value for eagle stamps if you have a charge account at this store.

            "content": "I was sitting in my room reading the newspaper that I get from my home-town. I noticed a picture of my girl friend, A. from home. A. is twenty-four-years-old. She is one of my closest friends. Her picture was in the society section. She was dressed in a bridal gown and veil. Her picture was above the picture of her brother's bride-to-be who is about twenty-two-years-old. She was also dressed in a bridal gown and veil.  As I was reading the reviews of the wedding, I felt very unhappy because I hadn't been home to attend the wedding. I thought that the wedding was to take place a week later than it did. In the lower left hand corner of the page was another picture of A. and this picture was tinted. It was the same pose as the one above it. I couldn't understand why A. was wearing such an outfit. Neither could I understand why there were two pictures of A. in the paper. Interpretation I am looking forward to going home for the wedding of my girl-friend A. 's brother. He is going to be married November 15, 1947. I haven't been home for about six-weeks, so I am getting anxious to see my family and also A. and her family. I was thinking about the wedding the day that I had this dream. The dream itself is a bit confusing. I do not know why I dreamed that A.'s picture would be in the paper in two places on the same page. Perhaps the two pictures were just an emphasis of the fact that the wedding is associated with A. I know that she is going to be in the wedding party. Answers to questions 2. Confused--couldn't understand why the two pictures of A. in the paper. Unhappy--because I had missed the wedding.3.

There was a sign nearby that had bold red and white letters on it that said \"VOTE FOR NUESS...\" (or Neff...). I walked a little way with a lady about 50 yrs. of Age--no one that I knew--and then came back to my \"post.\" There were a few other people of all ages in my dream but the lady I mentioned is the only distinct person that I remember. I didn't see the booth in the park but I felt as though there was one at the end of the walk. I remember that it way daytime and the sun was shining. Interpretation I do not know the candidate's name but he was running for mayor in the primaries this fall. (Here in C.) I had seen a man, the day of my dream, standing in front of a building, where voting was taking place, and he had a sign \"Vote for Nuess... (or Neff...).

I remember that it was my duty to tell her that she must do something to her hair so that it would be tidier and neater. The other nurse is about my age - maybe younger. I told her about her hair and then the dream was gone. Interpretation I do not know why I dreamed this dream. The other nurse in my dream is not a nurse in \"real life\" but an X-Ray technician. I may have been conscious of my own hair being stringy the day before I had this dream. I did not think it unusual to be in charge of the floor at home because I had been in charge of the floor before I came here for p.g. work at W.R.U. Answers to questions 2. Angry.

There were ten minutes left in the period and the teacher was one that I had for an English course last term. The teacher told me that I should take the examdnation and to write as quickly as possible so that I could get some credit. I took a seat and was unable to find my pen. I looked through my purse frantically and finally found the pen, but it didn't have any ink in it. I got some ink from the desk and then I couldn't find my blue book. I just had a few minutes left when I did find the book so I quickly wrote out the answer to the first question. Then the bell rang. When I handed in my book, I felt that I had failed the examination. Interpretation I had been reviewing for a chemistry examination the day that I had this dream. I reviewed all the material that I could and I still felt rather insecure about the material that I had studied. I believe that I felt that I wasn't very well prepared to take the examination. This dream was probably just a continuation of this feeling. Answers to questions 2. Frustrated, because I couldn't get my things together to take the test. Afraid, because I was late for the class.

The pool was built at a 45 degree angle. I was swimming downward instead of upward. My actions were deliberate and I did not feel any anxiety while I was swimming. I remember very clearly that I was swimming downward and that I was slightly confused about the thought that I had to get back up to the top of the pool. There was a very short interval of the dream that I do not remember, but I do know that in some way or another I did get back to the top of the pool and I started to swim down again. (I did this twice.) Interpretation I am not a good swimmer but I do go swimming now and then to try to improve my strokes, etc. I think that I associated the swimming with two of my classes that I am taking at the present time. The day before I had the dream, I felt that these two subjects were \"pulling me down\" and I was swamped with work in these two classes. Perhaps the pool without the water was a symbol for the lack of background in these two subjects which I felt so concerned about at the time of the dream.

I looked at my grade and it was marked \"90 - 30, grade 60\". I asked the teacher why I had thirty points taken off of my grade, and she said, ~You used a blue book that had notes in the back of it.\" I looked over the book and showed her that the notes were pertaining to another course. She said that she would give me the original grade but I should be careful of this in the future. My teacher was a lady about 40-45 years of age. Interpretation I was anxious to know the results of the test; I wanted to know the grade that I had made. I had to borrow a blue book before I could take the examination, because I had forgotten to bring a book to class. Before I had started to take the test, one of the girls asked me what time it was According to the M___ Code of honor, no talking should be done before, after, or during a test, while the girls are in the room taking a test. I thought that perhaps someone would think that we were discussing the test, and may have reported us.

            "content": "I was shopping in a large department store. I was looking for something very definite, but I wasn't sure of where it was, or what it was. I had to go to another floor, but I was afraid to get on the escalator because it was going so fast. Finally I steeled myself and forced myself to get aboard the conveyance. I was terrified going up at this break-neck speed. Finally I reached the floor above only to find that what I wanted was in reality downstairs. I was distressed at having to go down again, and confused by the milling crowds. Finally, I managed to get away from the crowd back into a deserted dingy corner where a dingy elevator was. I waited for it to come up with some misgivings, because I recalled similar experiences, from other dream situations, in which the elevator fell or went down too fast and made my stomach feel awful. But I had to get downstairs, and this elevator seemed the only way at the moment. I got in when it came and had the same feeling of inexplainable terror as we descended. It did go too fast, but it didn't fall completely out of control as I had feared, and on the whole wasn't half so bad as I'd anticipated. I felt relieved when I got out. Interpretation This dream, in slightly varying form of detail, has recurred to me at increasingly lengthening intervals ever since I can remember. At times, especially when I was younger, it was my mother I was looking for, and I was terrified because I was lost and separated from her. At other times, we were together, and I was afraid of the escalator or the elevator. I can't think of any reason for these dreams unless it is an insecurity I have always felt in my home life. I'm not sure, but it may be that I have this dream after my parents have had a serious argument. Answers to questions 2. Terrified, anxious, frustrated, a hurried, almost hunted feeling3.

            "content": "My mother, father, older sister, and I were at a riding academy, negotiating with the elderly farmer and his wife for pony rides. There were several very small ponies grazing nearby, some brown and white and one black and white. As soon as I saw the black and white one, I was very excited and anxious to ride that one. The farmer remarked that we women were wearing dresses, and offered to wash out some old slacks for us to wear. We were reluctant at first, but the wife was so anxious to have us do so that we must finally have agreed. She smiled almost fixedly at us, and I was fascinated by her shiny face and her literally apple-like cheeks, very round and brilliantly red. Then we were riding horses under an archway past the stables. This scene seemed familiar to me. I think I have dreamed this same riding scene before.  Next we were staying at the farmhouse which seemed to be a winter sports lodge. Somehow it fell to my lot to investigate some sort of crimes going on in the lodge. It was extremely dangerous and I felt as though I were constantly in peril. During the course of the investigation, my companion, (I think it was a girl about my own age who was supposed to be a friend of mine, but I can't identify her), and I discovered several human bodies lying on a wide ice-filled ledge jutting from a wall in the basement. I was surprised and a little repulsed at seeing my aged grandfather's body among those there. The arms and legs seem to have been cut off and were wrapped with the rest of the body in a great deal of grayish gauze with only the head protruding. My companion found a female relative of hers there, too, and expressed the same feelings I had. I was puzzled as to how they got my grandfather's body there, since he died and was buried last April.  In the next scene I was in a bedroom searching for \"evidence\" but I don't know what. My companion was with me but I had the feeling she was either not on my side, or just not of any help to me. Just as I was coming out of the room, hurriedly to escape detection, the two occupants came back. They passed me coming out of their room as they went in, but paid no attention to me, as though it were quite natural for me to be there. I was greatly relieved. One of the men was a large, heavy Englishman, slightly more than middle age, and the other, whom I knew to be the brains of the outfit, was the Mickey Rooney type. Somehow, I knew that he was 18 years old. He was very handsome and attractively dressed in light clothes.  In the next scene I discovered the secret. My companion and I were crouching outside the basement window, peering into a large room with rows of tables. Many men worked there, each at his own table, assembling parts of dismembered bodies, and applying make-up to them to prepare them for display. On each table were piled arms, legs, thumbs, and bodies in various degrees of dismemberment. I was at once fascinated and horrified at what I saw, but satisfied with the \"solution.\" Interpretation I can't imagine anything more like a radio mystery story. Since these are my favorite radio diet, the dream may mean that I closely identify myself with the heroic radio detectives. I got great satisfaction out of my role in this dream. I was the \"big deal.\" There were many people relying on me, it seemed. I was participating in the kind of excitement I never could find in real life, and when I awoke I felt very relaxed and pleased. Answers to questions 2. At various times in the dream I explained being:--excited, anxious, fascinated, surprised, repulsed, puzzled, relieved, horrified.3. Participant4. Both5. Inside and outside a winter sports lodge6. No, except one portion in the beginning which I explained as seeming to me to have been a part of other dreams I have had from time to time.7. I was very conscious with the intense red of the farmer woman's cheeks. I never remember having been conscious of color in any dream before."

            "content": "It seems there was some sort of University rally at M--A. building. All the boys and girls were supposed to parade through the building. Before the rally got to the building, several other girls and I went up to the third floor of M-- to explore. It seems we weren't supposed to go up there, according to the rules. We were very surprised to find that the teachers had their offices there. The hall was lined with shelves of books, something on the order of the arrangement of the second floor of the wing. I took several books off a table to put them on the shelf I knew belonged to this particular teacher. (Each teacher had a section where she kept her books.) Just as I was putting the books on the shelf, I noticed that a door at the end of the corridor was ajar and Miss K-- was sitting at her desk, looking at me. \"Those aren't her books. They're mine!\" she said crossly. I quickly put the books back down, and thought I better get away from there before she realized I was there against the rules, and I got into trouble.  The girls with me weren't very important in the dream. About this time, they dropped out of the action. I didn't want to get caught in the rally crowd, for some reason or other. I heard them coming up to the third floor so I thought I would hurry and get down the back way before they got upstairs. There were several stairways at intervals in the hall, and from where I stood, sort of in the middle, I could see them all. People were beginning to come up the stairway I had wanted to escape down. I ran to one of the others, and the same mob was already surging up there, too. It was the same with all the stairways, and by the time I had discovered this it was too late to get away at all, so with a resigned feeling of disgust I allowed myself to be swept along for a ways. It seemed to be a square hall, and we went all around it and then we were to go back downstairs again. As we reached the stairway, I noticed that just at the head of it there was a bathroom. I felt that this was my chance to escape so I ducked in there without anyone seeing me. There was a combination of a clothes chute, dumb waiter, and spiral stairway in the bathroom which I thought it would be a cinch to use for escape.  It was up quite high from the floor and with some difficulty I managed to get my legs into it in preparation to descend. Then it seemed as though it was smaller in diameter than I had first thought it to be, and higher from the floor. I felt trapped. I couldn't get down through the tube, whatever it was, and I was stuck so that I couldn't get back down to the floor. I was getting worried and was trying to think of some way I could get down through that opening. Then all of a sudden I could get out quite easily, and I found, looking down, that from my position I could easily and safely jump to the floor. I was greatly relieved and I jumped down and all my problems seemed to have been solved. Interpretation My situation of being stuck and having several alternatives, not knowing what to do reminds me of the situation I was in the evening before I had the dream. I came home in quite a confused mood after being almost stranded in a strange neighborhood, trying to call a cab from a neighborhood bar and being stopped in my purpose by a local hoodlum, and finally a male and a female friend of mine showing up with a car and taking me home. I was quite upset when I went to bed, and I think this may account, in part for the dream. Answers to questions 2. I was surprised to find teachers offices there, a little frightened at Miss K--, disappointed & disgusted at being caught in the rally, frightened and frustrated in the chute, relieved when I got out safely.3. Participant4. Unpleasant5. M-- A-- building, the non-existent \"third floor,\" and a bathroom there.6. I have dreamed being caught in similar predicaments, and some scenes in those halls I know have been present in other dreams, but the plot of the dream this time was new.7. I was definitely conscious of an unusually large number of red sweaters and jackets on the students as I saw them surge to the top of the stairs."

            "content": "I walked into a tiny picturesque blacksmith shop and there, at a large table, the blacksmith and his wife were shoeing a tiny white donkey. I knew it was a donkey although it was no bigger than a fox terrier. It was lying flattened on its stomach, front legs out front, hind legs out back. The blacksmith's wife was holding his head while the blacksmith held one dainty hind foot between his thumb and forefinger and filed the shoe around the edges. I talked to them, and noticed that the blacksmith had a handful of tiny horse shoes similar in size and shape to copper pennies with a horseshoe-shaped rim around them. Then I saw a rather large two-wheeled cart standing next to the donkey. \"Does he really pull that?\" I asked, and they answered proudly, \"Oh, yes, all the time.\" I felt sorry for him, having to pull such a large wagon, but I just said, \"Isn't that remarkable.\"  The blacksmith was very nice. He led me into the adjoining barn where there were larger white donkeys, saying, ''I'll tell you the story about why these white donkeys wear shoes.\" The barn was sweet and pleasant, and the animals had very human expressions on their faces. I had a very comfortable feeling of being glad to be there hearing the story. I felt as though I had gone back to live in a fairy tale. The story started to be very interesting. It would have been a wonderful story, I am sure if I could have heard it. Just as it was begun, however, my mother was waking me up. I was very disappointed at having to awaken. Interpretation One of my friends who helps keep me supplied with dreams was telling me her dream about a tiny horse the day before I had this dream. It struck us both as very funny as she told it, and we laughed a good deal about it. This may have had something to do with why I dreamed about a miniature donkey.

He sat in a familiar chair in my living room and played hot trumpet music. Our front door was open and there were a great many people on the front porch and in the front yard who had come to see and hear him. I sat opposite him and became more and more interested in him. I decided that, since there was some place I had to go after his performance, I'd promote things so that he'd take me. He kept looking my way and smiling and I felt greatly encouraged. All of a sudden a young colored girl hurried through the room and upstairs to remove her hat and coat, casting a coy glance at Joe as she passed. I wondered whether it was his wife or his girl. He turned to me and said, half to me, half as though he were talking to himself, \"At last she came to see me! I didn't think she would, she hasn't come for so many of my shows, but now she's here!\" I looked at hlm and saw that his eyes were brimming with tears. I was very surprised to see evidences of such deep emotion, and also considerably crestfallen because that ended my chances.

We had been somewhere and were on the way home, but why we parked there, I don't know. The general atmosphere in the car seemed to be strictly inharmonious. I was out of sorts because I was the only one there without a date, and I sat slouched down in the corner of the front seat. My mother, father, older sister were there, together with several couples of my friends whom I am unable to identify. It seems there were some dishes down in our church basement which I had mentioned a dislike for at one time. I had mentioned this unthinkingly in a casual manner to a character with whom I had gone out several times. He is a couple of years older than I am and has a friend of the same age who acts as his stooge, humoring along his boorish tendencies, and laughing at his jokes: generally, stooging for him, although he's a little less ignorant. All of a sudden, I saw this fellow, together with his stooge and the latter's wife (he's not married really, and the man in the dream didn't look like him, but I knew it was he), come out of the church basement carrying piles of these dishes and laughing loudly and hysterically. They crossed the street and came over in front of our car. Then my \"friend\" started to put on his act. He would hold out a dish at arm's length and with a deliberate gesture, drop it on the ground and let it break. He had different ways of breaking them. Some he dropped in this fashion and others he crushed in his hands, still others he tossed in fancy ways before he let them break. I was utterly revolted that he could think up such a thoroughly stupid thing to do. I was completely disgusted, and tried to pretend that I didn't see him so that he would go away. I think the other people in the car were amused, and laughed every once in a while. He laughed hysterically as he performed, calling, \"Look -- look!\" I slouched down further in the corner of the seat, but I couldn't help smiling every once in a while. I don't know why because I certainly didn't think he was funny. Interpretation Although I have dated this man several times, I think he is an utter character. I spend my time avoiding him now. This act I dreamed of his putting on is just the sort of thing he would really do to attract my attention, or try to get my favor. I have a few facts that might in some way explain the dream. One, he is of a radically different religion from mine, and we don't see eye to eye at all on this score. This may have something to do with the setting of the dream near the church. One time when I was with him, I casually admired a lovely cigarette ease in a jewelry store window, and he went down and bought it the next day for me. This case reminds me of the casual mention of not liking the dishes prompting him to break them all to win my favor. Then, of course, there is Freud's interpretation of breaking dishes. I find it rather difficult to apply this to my dream, however. Answers to questions 2. I felt disgusted and revolted throughout the whole dream.3. Participant4. Unpleasant5.

            "content": "I had some sort of report that it was very important for me to give to our family doctor, an elderly man whom, incidentally, I do not like. I looked out of the living room window and saw him driving slowly by in a car with two other people, a man and a woman. I ran out to him with several papers (my report--it seemed as though it was some sort of progress report on my own condition) in my hand and caught up with him a few doors down the street. I felt very kindly toward him, and very glad to see him, just the opposite as I should feel in real life. The man with him in the car was a man who lives in my neighborhood and whom I have seen many times, but whom I do not know by name. He is older than I am, but I do not think he is thirty yet. The woman was no one I knew, and she was not familiar to me in the dream. It seemed as though the man knew me very well, but I was quite surprised to find him so cordial and interested in me when I didn't even know his name. He sat very close to the old lady with him, and once said something affectionate to her and kissed her, at which she giggled. At first, I thought this most unusual that so young a man should be with an old woman, but no more I had thought that when I \"realized\" that it must be his mother. I was very satisfied with that explanation. Then the doctor started to drive the car in the opposite direction from where it had been facing, and about two doors down from my house on the other side, I saw several people coming out. First, was a girl whom I recognized as a girl I went to junior high school with, who had been a very good friend of mine. It didn't look like her, but I knew that it was she. Then a young man came out, following her to the car, and I thought he looked vaguely familiar, concluding that it was J--, the boy L-- had a crush on in Junior high school. I wondered whether she had finally been successful in winning him, and projecting forward in some way, asked someone later about it who told me that they were now married, after many troubles and separations. I felt very pleased about this, and remarked about it to my companions. I felt as though my faith had been restored in human nature. Interpretation Free associating, I can get a few ideas. The man in the car was blond, as was a man I had a date with Thurs. Having a reputation of a cynic, his liking me was a great surprise to me. Ages and birthdays came into our conversation, and I found I was 2 months older than he. That may explain the old woman and young man. I can also tie in the thought of finding something finally after trials and tribulations, as L-- did in the dream. In connection with the first thought, I might mention that I knew this date of mine previously, but had never dated him before. When I really talked to him, I found that he was a very different person from what I had assumed him to be after taking in all the things I had heard about his cold cynicism. The more I free-associate, the more I feel that this explanation has much to do with the dream. Answers to questions 2. Puzzled at friendliness of man. Surprised at his being with old woman. Pleased and happy at L--'s happiness.3. Participant4. Pleasant5. Car on the street in the vicinity of my house6. No7. No"

            "content": "I was coming home from work with two people. One was an older woman whom I believe is somewhere in her fifties, a very active person who, somehow, always seems to me much like my mother. The other person seemed to have been another of my co-workers (the older woman being a woman with whom I work at a department store), although I never did actually establish who it was. It seems to me as though it was supposed to be a boy acquaintance of mine, someone with whom I used to go to school a number of years ago and whom I haven't seen for several months because of the fact that he is in the navy. He is about six months younger than I am. As we came out of the store I was aware of the definite need not to look directly at this third person. I thought, \"I don't want to give him the satisfaction that I am being eager.\" When we got outside, we boarded a conveyance: a sort of flat cart on wheels drawn by a horse and driven by a coachman seated high in front. The older woman and I got on one side, and the other person, who I almost subconsciously sensed to be this boy, got on the other side, with his back to ours. I again was very careful not to turn around so that he wouldn't think that I was looking at him. I thought, \"It certainly will be wonderful to tell everyone when I get home that I actually rode in one of these things.\" For this brief instant it seemed that we were in a strange city or country. Then I began to feel uneasy about getting home. We had to sit very carefully so that we didn't get jarred off the cart as it bumped down a steep hill. All of a sudden the woman jumped off, saying, \"Oh, my goodness I must have forgotten my glasses. I'll have to go back to get them I can't see a thing without them.\" And she began to search through her pockets in a distressed manner while following the slowly moving cart down the street. I had a sinking feeling at the thought of having to turn back to retrieve the glasses, and sort of hoped that she would go back alone if she had to get them. But she didn't--she was running along behind, trying to catch up with the wagon, although it was going very slowly. Incidentally, I'm sure she had her glasses on, I remember noticing them, but just didn't feel like telling her, I guess. I figured if she said she forgot them, then she did. Another thing I remember was wondering, shortly after we got on, how we would manage the matter of the fare--concluding that we would undoubtedly each pay a part of it. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation for this dream. I an of the opinion, however, that these people are really supposed to stand for others, because of their remoteness to me. I have no particularly strong relationship to either of them, and seldom do they cross my conscious mind. Answers to questions 2. The whole trend of events in the dream distressed me immensely.

I recognized many of them, but I can't recall who most of them were. I don't remember whether there were any men present. One girl was walking around blinking her right eye and looking quite miserable. I recognized her as a girl whom we try to escape at lunch every day at school. She's quite repulsive, and none of the girls care to have much to do with her. In my dream, no one was paying any attention to her as usual. I asked her what was wrong, and she said that she'd had something in her eyes for days. She was working at it with a bobby pin and I immediately realized this was very unsanitary, so I offered to get it out for her. I pulled down the lower lid and saw a tiny black speck in the corner of the eye. I decided first I'd need a toothpick, but thought, but there aren't any around here, with a feeling almost of panic. Then I remembered having seen some somewhere, and found them in a very unusual place, on a shelf where I would never expect to find them. They seemed to pop up there just because I needed them. I had the feeling that I was very triumphant. I felt almost as though I had worked magic. I took several out of the box they were in, and put one in my mouth because I felt that after all, that was where toothpicks belonged. Next, I needed some cotton, and that turned up in much the same way as the toothpicks had. I felt the same way about finding that. I also felt pleased with myself because I was being so benevolent to this character. I didn't waste any love on her, to be sure, but I felt that I was at least doing my moral duty which was more than any of the other girls were doing. Interpretation I can't offer any interpretation, because I can't think of any possible connections between the dream and anything which happened on the previous day or any other time.

            "content": "I was at a party given by a club of boys who are good friends of mine. Their parties are quite famous, and so are they personally, as definitely extra-special. I met them almost two years ago, about four months before I broke up with my \"steady\", and after that, I began to be considered as part of the club's gang of boys and girls. All the boys were at the party in my dream, and all their regular girls whom I know so well. I was having a wonderful time, and felt so happy as to be almost floating on air. All of a sudden, in a very natural way as though it weren't unusual, in walked my \"ex\". I was so happy to see him that I almost ran up to him and threw my arms around him. But I didn't. I greeted him and felt gratified that he was very friendly and held no grudge. (This would be very unlike him in real life, I'm afraid.) We sat down together on a davenport in the middle of the long, smoke-dimmed room. Just before he (\"Ex) came in, the boy who brought me to the party left with his best friend, also a member of the club and a good friend of mine. They were going out to buy more supplies for the party. The fact that my date would come back and find me with this strange man didn't seem to worry me at all. All I could think about was how happy I was that he had come to the party. I was just dying to introduce him to all of the people there. I said, \"I'm so glad you've come back, because now you can meet all my wonderful new friends, and I can share them and these good times with you.\" Then I thought I'd better ask him how he happened to come there. He held my hand and looked seriously into my eyes and said simply, \"I came back because I still love you.\" I was so thrilled and so completely happy that I woke up. Interpretation This sounds like wish-fulfillment to me. I have thought so many times since I have met the club how much he would enjoy the people. At times I have thought, \"I'm having such a good time at this party (or picnic) but it needs only one thing to make it perfect--\". In my dream I got the one thing that made everything perfect.

They disclosed to my slyly that the time had now come for me to meet \"the real John Doe\" (the boy). I was mildly surprised to learn that this boy whom I had thought I knew so well was only taking the part of the real one. I was mildly interested in knowing what the \"real John Doe\" was like. At no time were my emotions about any of this very strong. I was only mildly affected by the strange happenings. On the way to the Real John Doe's house they told me that I would like the real one much better. Finally, we arrived and went down to the basement where he had his darkroom. The boy I know is very interested in photography, and the scene was familiar to me as being in his home and just the way we have gone down to inspect his darkroom in real life. When we got down into the basement, there was this \"real John Doe\" absorbed in his photography work. The one whom I had known as John said dramatically to me, \"THIS---is the Real John Doe!\" We said \"how-do-you-do?\" and he immediately began to tell me why his identity had been hidden from me. I thought it was all very nice, but it didn't surprise me that the real John expected the false John to do a fadeout. No one seemed to be surprised by anything. The real John had some of the same physical characteristics as the one I had known, but there was no mistaking one for the other. The real one seemed to be milder and kinder and had the look about him that would make people say at first glance, \"My, isn't he a nice boy!\" That was how he differed from the false John. Interpretation This sounds very much like an actual experience changed around so that the main person is different. My girlfriend had a boyfriend whom He both admired because he was so different from other \"angle boys\". He was so completely unemotional for five months while dating her that we had begun to believe he was that way naturally. Then one day our faith in human nature was shattered.

Then I began to have qualms about what I had done so impetuously. I thought, \"But I don't even know this man. Here we are married, I'll have to live with him the rest of my life, and what if I find out he's not what I want in a mate?\" Then I thought, \"I can get a quick divorce because we were just married, and no one need ever know\". Then I decided nobly, \"No, you've done this thing and it's up to you to make a go of it. In a few years you'll get acquainted and you can learn to love him\". (Reminds me of the things I have read repeatedly in the lovelorn columns of the newspapers. That's usually the kind of advice they dole out.) Then the man came into the picture. He wasn't bad looking and seemed to be a nice enough person, although he doesn't remind me of anyone. I don't know how I happened to choose him to marry. He seemed almost to not even be aware of our marriage, and to care less. He took the attitude, \"Well, we're married, and I suppose we'll have to stay that way--this is your show, so you call it. What do we do now?\" That was beginning to worry me, too. I thought what will people say when they find out about this? They will expect us to act married, and I can't act married with this man I don't even know. I remember in the beginning of the dream noticing that I had on a cheap engagement ring. It was silver. I thought people might think it was platinum, but anyhow I was glad he had been nice enough to get a sterling silver one. It had been nice on his part since, of course, since he didn't particularly care for me he had not morally been obligated to do anything like that for me. Now the ring had become a plain wedding ring. I remember that we had a conversation concerning our situation. He smirked good-naturedly in an I-don't-care way, and let me know that if I wanted to act married, he'd go along with it, and if I didn't he didn't care either. I practiced calling him affectionate names like \"honey\", but I felt very foolish and uncomfortable doing it. He treated me in the same affectionate way. I was full of remorse for having been so eager, but I thought, well he's a good guy, maybe we can work it out. Interpretation Could be I have been thinking too much lately about getting married, and thinking about it in an entirely objective way, weighing this one against that one.

I went over to see what he was writing and noted that he was copying word for word the paper of the boy next to him.

(I have never liked this boy, he is a pre-ministerial student at W-- and is always cheating in tests.) This seemed a good way to teach him a lesson so I typed up the report to hand to the Dean in the morning. The next day I couldn't bring myself to report him but had mentioned it to several people. By noon I heard that most of the class had been reported for a similar offense and everyone accused me of doing it. One of the girls included was a very good friend of mine and I was extremely upset to think that she would think I did it. When the dream ended I was still busy trying to clear myself of the implications. Interpretation The stimulus for this dream no doubt arose from an article I read that evening concerning scholastic cheating and the method of dealing with it which has been recommended, namely the honor system and ensuing reports, on all offenders. As I said the boy in question is a constant cheater and it irks me to think that he not only cheats but is going into the ministry on that basis. I dislike him and often wish he would be caught. I didn't turn in the report because I don't feel that that is the method of cure, and also because I never want to be known as a squealer. Answers to questions 2.

A young boy was busy stripping the papers off the windows and when gone we could see into the gym itself.

I found out, when I was given a party just before leaving and it was very gratifying, to say the least.

The object of the game was to jump in the water and pop balloons with a hammer. After watching this I dove into the pool. Shortly afterwards I noticed the pool was empty. The next time I went in there was water in it. Then I took a long run along the side and was in the air over the pool when I noticed it had been drained again. I righted myself and landed on my feet.

They were all strangers to me and looked about 30 years old. There was a mutual attraction between one of the men (a blonde) and myself and somehow I felt I was in love with him. He offered to drive back a street for me. My parents came up to me to drive the car back but I told them to leave us and went with him. Later, when coming up my driveway, this man's wife came out of my house and on seeing me began screaming and having hallucinations that worms were on her. Her husband and I took her to the hospital and secretly I hoped she wouldn't get well so that her husband and I could be together but I also felt terrible at thinking these thoughts.

It seems too that I am not going to allow my parents to interfere as they might have done in the past. I am happier without them, in this dream.

Perhaps that had some thing to do - the part about the stockings also as a child growing up I have always felt disturbed about the fact I could never sit like the other children, and as I was on the heavy side I thought it was because I was over weight; which I have found out it was not due to that.

I don't know who told me the news, but soon after I heard it, the telephone rang and I heard my father's voice. He called to tell me about my mother. When he spoke to me, I felt very sorry for him and suddenly pitied him because he would be alone. When he spoke of my mother, I thought of her and at this point had an intense emotional outburst of tears. Later I remember sensing a fear and dread of going to my mother's funeral. I did not wish to see her dead. I then visualized my mother's face before me with her eyes closed. It was very vivid. Interpretation Here is a classic illustration of the oedipus problem. It is difficult for me to say exactly what this dream means, but it is obvious to me that many of my unconscious feelings toward my parents came out here. Any hostility for my mother which I have was expressed in this death dream. The pity I felt for my father is significant of my feelings toward him. Pity for myself was also experienced and a lost feeling knowing my mother was gone. My hostility feelings toward my mother are never expressed directly.

I remember sitting on the built up stands and watching the skaters go through their various acts. And then the show was over and all the people were slowly leaving and it was getting later and later. I was sitting on the steps that lead up into the coat room. Everyone that went by me seemed to not see me although I was sitting there with no clothes on but some kind of a blanket over me. I remember asking everyone to bring me my clothes so I could go home, but they seemed not to hear me. For some reason I had the feeling that I couldn't move. Finally there was no one around but I still couldn't move. At this point I woke up. Interpretation I have been told that this type of dream where you are out in public without any clothes on and not being able to move, is a very common dream, and I have also been told that it is indicative of feelings of insecurity. Any further explanation, I can not give, on second thought the fact that I do not skate and would like to be able to skate might be the reason for my insecure feelings. I definitely had the sensation that I didn't belong because I couldn't skate. Answers to questions 2. I had the feeling of frustration in that I could not move or put my clothes on.

My companions were students of the same sex, and also a few older women who were apparently our teachers or perhaps chaperones. The interior of the plane was unique in that it resembled a large mansion with an overabundance of large easy chairs. I recall that we were on some kind of tour along the East Coast, with Florida as our ultimate destination. The most prominent thing in my dream to me was the fact that the plane was going by way of Alaska, and that I would have to be on the Plane with all these unliked strangers for days on end. Everyone else was having a good time doing such things as singing, eating, playing cards, and sleeping. I recall that one older woman, the particulars of whom apparently were minor to me, kept pestering me to do things that I had no desire to do. I remember distinctly being afraid to leave my chair or the window for fear the plane would land and I would miss my opportunity to get off and find help. I remember trying over and over again to convince everyone that we did not have to fly the course on which we had started. For some reason I was in a hurry to get back to a certain destination. Neither my home or Florida or any other specific place seemed to be in my dream as where I wanted to be. Occasionally, a familiar person that I liked walked by me, but seemed to be deaf to what I was saying, and apparently they were not conscious of my presence. I can remember distinctly that I thought I was in a world where no one else existed. The last thing before I woke up was that I experienced that falling through space feeling--at which point I woke up. Interpretation My knowledge of the causes and reasons for dreams is practically nil. This dream I remembered the next morning, as if it had actually happened. I gave each part thought, and these are my only results. I dislike flying, although when I have flown, no terrifying thing has happened. Perhaps the fact that my first flight was because of the need to return home from college on my father's death. As for my anger over going such a round about way; maybe that has some relationship for my liking to get places in a hurry for fear of missing something. The sensation of falling through space I have frequently in dreams. I have no fear of high places, deep water, and the like. Some say that that falling sensation may be partially attributed to insecurity of one kind or another. The general restlessness of the whole dream might be tied up with my always present nervousness before exam periods. Answers to questions 2. My most prominent emotions were that I was angry, afraid, and annoyed. My feelings were definitely hostile, and also feelings of doubt.3. An actual participant.4. Unpleasant.5.

Then I recall trying to get away from the window but a crowd kept pushing me nearer and nearer the burning boats until finally I was surrounded by fire at which point I woke up to find myself standing up against the head board of my bed. Interpretation This dream was just before I got up, therefore it was not a sound sleep. We spend summers on a lake each year, and the night before we had been discussing next summer's plans. The fire, etc., might be explained by the fact that I had just seen a movie in which there was a great deal of fire. Fires always impress me because from the age of one I have been taught the dangers of forest fires in particular, whether the fact that I had eaten a hamburger etc. just before going to bed, has anything to do with my being hungry, is a mystery to me. On the other hand, being a dream near breakfast time, it could. be reflecting my anticipating breakfast. Answers to questions 2. The only emotion that I recall was when I woke up, and that was surprise rather than fright.3. An actual participant.4. Both pleasant and unpleasant.5. The setting varies as is explained, but it seems to me that I spent more time in that tunnel than anywhere else.6. No7. I remember that the fire was a definite red."

In the so called car with me was my aunt who was sitting in a chair similar to mine. Still another person was present. At one moment she resembled a classmate of mine, and yet the next moment she resembled no one T knew. I recall the sensation that we were driving over very flat and uninteresting country and that we all couldn't figure out why we didn't stop occasionally. Finally we stopped in front of a huge building of some kind, probably a gas station a little distorted. Everyone got out of the car but me, yet I recall I was the one who wanted to stop the most. Finally I was in the ladies room, the others having returned to the car. Right in the middle of the room, there was ?. big bed.

I left her for a few moments and met an older man (who is about 40 years old, was the chaperon on a couple of geology trips I was on and who apparently took a great interest in me). He asked me to go to a bar and have a couple of drinks with him. We started walking toward the city hall and all at once the street and sidewalks were crowded with 'madly' rushing people shouting and screaming. We stopped and heard the sound of explosions, each one getting louder than the one before. Some one cried that the world was coming to an end. We started running back to the library and then stopped again as we saw a car sliding sidewards, going at a rapid speed, which hit another car. Here I seemed to realize that the people in cars were driving as fast as they could in order to escape the explosions and death. People were thrown out of one of the cars. Two people seemed to have been killed. Dream ended. Interpretation I probably dreamed of this certain man because I had just had a letter from him. I account for dreaming about explosions because the day before this dream I had commented to some one about how terrible it was that there have been so many explosions lately--L. A.  C--, C--. We also discussed the atomic bomb and the fact that it is possible for the world to be destroyed by it.

I'm very conscious now of my feeling toward him because people talk to me of his engagement & proceed to either watch or question me quite frankly as to my reaction.

This is the third dream I have had in which I have been driving and shifting gears has been such an important part of the dream.

After trotting for a few minutes the horse threw me off his back. I was very frightened and yelled. Before I could do anything else, the horse began to chew my hand. It was very sinister to watch him gnaw at the bones. I woke up as he had chewed half my hand. Interpretation Probably the brown horse was my goal. When he threw me off it probably revealed someone blocked my goal and I became frustrated. Although this interpretation might be far from the point it does seem plausible. Lately I am beginning to feel my goal in life is being blocked. Because all my friends are getting engaged and I am beginning to feel that I will be an old maid. My inability to get a husband will probably result in frustration.  The interpretation of the horse eating my hand is very clear. On Friday, prior to this dream, I did go to the doctor to see about my finger. From playing golf I received a sore, and this sore developed into a wart. The doctor burned it and nothing remains where the sore had been. The horse in this instance could be the doctor attending to my sore finger. Answers to questions 2.

We went to a paladium that looked like the H. Theatre from the outside but had every earmark of H. H. at M. University. We all went in but we found everyone singing instead of dancing. Therefore we all sat down and began singing. My three girlfriends from M. University came in also. C., one of the girls was mad at me because I wouldn't exchange seats with her.

He was so funny that everyone had a swell time. The dream ended at this moment. Interpretation Since I have many friends it does seem probable to dream of so many friends. The paladium that resembled the H. Theatre as well as H. probably could be traced back to last year. At that time I had a conflicting cholce to make. I couldn't decide if I should go back to M. University (where I spent my freshman year) or enter F. S. M. College.  The change from dancing to singing could be that I recently joined a choir. My interest in music is being stimulated even though I still hold a great interest for dancing.  The reason that I. entered my dream seems due to the interest I held in him last semester. Unconsciously, I am still thinking of him, although not consciously. He always wore a blue suit. The new shoes probably is due to the fact that I went out the Saturday night before with a fella that wore new shoes. It may be probable that I would a man assimilated between these two characters.  I am very used to having all the friends come over my house so this last part of the dream is very real. Although my dad isn't very funny with my friends. He is very friendly but not very funny.

He seems quite unhappy. He therefore comes to H. to be appreciated. and I suppose a reason I like him is that I would like to identify myself with his musical ability.  I turned my back on the audience. People comment on my (real, not imagined) lack of musical ability. But one man heard me - and appreciated me - laughed with my that I was smoking the pipe - made clever conversation - is an optimistic sign. Answers to questions 1. Fellows - slightly older than I2.

In one of these dreams I had forgotten to call or write greetings for her birthday, and when I returned home found she had died. My father, to console himself, was reading \"The Bird's Xmas Carol.\" I took the book from him, to read it myself. In the manner of dreams, however, I read ahead of the print, and it was meaningless.  I had a feeling of great remorse at my mother's death, and felt a stronger love for her than I had ever known while she was alive.  The dream left a strong impression, and even now, when I think of it, experience a feeling of great tenderness toward my mother. Interpretation I do not know why I worried in my dream about forgetting my mother's birthday, for I had looked forward for several weeks to calling her and talking to her.  The \"Bird's Xmas Carol\" reminded me of a similar incident that happened when I was ten and in the 5th grade, our teacher, just before Christmas vacation, read the story to our class, and while she read it, I experienced the same feeling of love and tenderness toward my mother. I remember running home from school at lunch time to see if she were all right. Answers to questions 2. Sadness3. Participant4. Unpleasant5.

I drifted farther out with apparent unconcern until I noticed the water was becoming scummy and filled with debris. I then became alarmed and thrashed around in the water, but became tired quickly and ceased to struggle, continuing to float.

I watched my fiance greet a friend of his by shaking his hand and pounding his friend's hand exuberantly. As a gift, he brought me an expensive pair of eye glass frames in an elaborate glass-case, instead of merely having the frames adjusted, as I had requested. On another occasion, I was sitting on a narrow steel bar about six feet above the ground, discussing my engagement with several friends below me. They later, to my bewilderment, claimed to have known nothing about it, but when I mentioned his name, their enthusiastic replies were how lucky it was that my fiance did not have flat feet! Interpretation This dream, I am sure, is a natural result of a tired, active mind as it works during sleep. There was no organization and comparatively little imagination in it--it is only a slight elaboration and pictorialization of thoughts that had come to my mind during the day. Almost all the details can be matched to actual trends of thought.  Outside factors had probably made themselves felt; the engagement ring in the dream was actually a ring I had found during that day which I had believed lost and which I wore to bed. Perhaps my dream-act of sitting on the steel bar above my friends, however, was a subconscious feeling of superiority to them.  The only person in the dream whom I can actually identify was a friend whom I had seen to talk to that day for the first time in several months. And my fiance, in my dream, was actually a boy whom I had known for several weeks a year or so previously, and had not thought of since that time. Answers to questions 2.

There was already another person in the elevator, who wanted to get off at the 8th floor. There was some difficulty with the push button, and, after going up, we started to descend again. There was a moment of confusion after which the elevator began its slow ascent again. I had a sensation of claustrophobia.  The swimming pool was in amphitheatre arrangement, with tiers of seats that sloped down to the pool itself. The water, however, looked heavy and thick, and was of a deep blue-green black color, altogether unpleasant. Ahead of my friends, I went down the right aisle to the pool. I started to dive in, but a scream from my friends stopped me; they explained to me that there were five baby pigs at the end of the pool. To get to the other side, it was necessary to go back up the step-aisle and pass in front of the spectators scattered around the \"theatre.\" Among them were several boys of my own age, who guffawed loudly at the mistake I had made. With heavy sarcasm and some anger I \"fraw hawed\" back at them. When I had passed, I had the uneasy feeling that they must have thought I was crazy.  At the left end I dived into the pool, and to be sure I did not encounter the pigs, followed a girl in a yellow bathing suit who was swimming in front of me. The pool was divided into several sections by what resembled a clothes rope. I continually entangled myself in these ropes as I tried to swim over them. At this point of the dream I learned that the little pigs were a part of a game provided by the management for its guests; if somebody swam into or near the \"pig pen,\" the crib arrangement in which they were kept would overturn and they would be at freedom in the pool, and swimmers in turn, would be forced to use the pigs' former crib if they did not want to swim with the pigs. Interpretation This dream followed a whole day of intensive study with out a break. I still had not finished my work, however and as I went to bed I worried about finishing it. This may have some bearing on the dream.  The swimming I believe hinges on the fact that twice a week, for an hour or so, I swim at the C. Club. There is a self-operated elevator there, which also has a tendency to get stuck.  The incident of being ridiculed by the boys, I imagine, is my fear of that very thing.  The amphitheatre arrangement may be explained by the fact that I have lately been a spectator myself at several swim meets, looking down from the side to the pool. Answers to questions 2.

My friend stepped down from the path to test the ice in the lagoon, and I realized I was tired of carrying the rock. I let it go, and without my intending it to, it struck my friend in the back. She fell to the ice, evidently unconscious, and a deep, black hole appeared in her back. I had a feeling of horror but helplessness. At this point of the dream events became confused, but when they cleared, I was lying on the path, pretending either that I was ill or had fainted, and several of my friends (girls, whom I remember as knowing but cannot now identify) was standing around me, discussing how I should be punished for having injured my friend. Interpretation To hit my friend with a rock, even if accidentally done in the dream, would probably indicate repressed hostility toward her, although I can think of no reason for that feeling. Pretending to be unconscious, as an escape mechanism, seemed to be a familiar feeling in the dream. Perhaps it stems from an occasion when I was in elementary school, and, being pelted by snowballs from a tomboy school acquaintance, fell down in a snowbank and pretended to have been injured. This dream recalled the incident to my mind after having forgotten about it for several years. Answers to questions 2. Surprise and horror at having injured my friend; fear of results.3.

Several girl friends and myself were driving home from downtown. I was sitting on somebody's lap and feeling in good spirits; one of the girls, however, was sound asleep, her head resting against a window.  The home at which we arrived was at the top of a hill on a very wooded, mountainous section of Virginia. I was standing on the porch (complete with white pillars) and there was a young soldier with me. I had the feeling he was one of the \"test tube\" soldiers of Ft. Knox; he was very young and wearing a clean, well-pressed uniform, and had red hair. I believe we were waiting for breakfast. He said something to me, and we went to the back of the house. It seems he has wanted to burn rubbish, but the fire had spread to the whole hill, and to hills beyond. There was a great deal of smoke in the air, but I could see no fire.  We returned to the house. In the front center hall, when we entered, was a discussion as to what to do. A woman evidently the owner, decided to open the paddock to free the horses, so somebody, with several dogs, set them free.  In the next action I was a spectator, and the dream took on a motion-picture semblance. The horses were fleeing wildly, and there were several palaminoes I noticed especially. Interpretation All I can really explain is about the soldier and the fire. I had read several articles at that time of the Fort Knox experiment, which interested me.  The fire, I believe, is more important. When I was much younger I used to have nightmares about fire, always in our own home. A fire would start in our attic, I would dream, and sweep thru the house, destroying everything.  This fear of fire I can trace to two sources: first, that my father often became angry with me when he found my toys strewn about the attic, and he often mentioned the possibility of fire. Secondly, for many years our house was next to a wooded, grassy field where field fires in dry summer were a potential danger. My childhood dreams of a fire were very vivid and terrifying and on at least one occasion I got out of bed and went to the attic to see if all was well.  I think probably the above dream was that old fear in a new garb. Answers to questions 2. None in particular3. Both (as defined in dream)4. Neither5.

At six o'clock, however, I was horrified; I had failed to attend a water safety class upon which my summer job depended, and a sense of obligation told me I should have attended the meeting.

There were only four or five of us counselors there and we were to organize a pre-camp training course. I cannot now remember the other dream characters, (although I knew them in the dream) except one who is a friend of mine here at school. It was a very rainy, dark, dreary day when we arrived, and while we were unpacking, when our camp director assigned us jobs and I was to gather firewood, I asked, intending to be facetious, \"dry firewood?\" When the director looked scornful at that remark, I felt ashamed and embarrassed. As I unpacked my unusually large suitcase I discovered at the bottom dozens of candles of all sizes. I did not know why they were there, but realized they would be useful at the \"final banquet,\" a tradition and quite an occasion.  I also discovered many sweaters -- sweaters I have had for years, and I was glad to see them, for I was cold and wet. As I stood there, in my slip, I looked down the hill to the road and saw a man in an automobile driving past and staring up at me. It made me quite angry. Interpretation I have been preparing to return to camp this summer, and during the week of this dream had been busy filling out application blanks and writing to counselors I had known there last year. The directyor in the dream has since resigned and been replaced. The feeling of inadequacy with her I had occasionally felt, but it was not a constant feeling.  Candles seem to be a source of anxiety--for some reason it seems I am constantly having to get them for occasions; parties, concerts, birthdays, etc., and very often have forgotten them or been unable to buy them. They may have represented a feeling of frustration. Firewood seems to be another frustration symbol, for keeping it dry was of prime importance, and I was often mildly bothered about it at camp, fearing it would get wet and we would be unable to have a fire.

I had a feeling then of belonging to English royalty.  As I went into the street, it was raining, and I had to walk carefully, for it was very slippery. It was at night, and the lights from the shops on the streets reflected on the wet pavement. I began to cry, and a friend of mine came up to me to beg me not to commit suicide. I assured her that I wouldn't, saying that a five-minute walk in the rain would fix me up completely. I then lay down on the pavement and cried and cried. Interpretation My act of abdication produced in me a most intense feeling somewhere between the martyristic and brave \"I can take it\" attitude. My friend who begged me not to commit suicide, I realize, has appeared before in a minor part in a recent dream. I do not know why, for I see her seldom, and am not on intimate terms with her, although we have known each other since kindergarten days.

She was a very ragged, dirty and unkempt child, which bothered me considerably. I took her to her home, which was the lower half of a double house on a street not far from ours, and found the place in a deplorable messy condition. We went through several rooms, all of which seemed to be furnished in living-room style, to the kitchen in the back. The kitchen too, was in an abhorrable state; dishes of food from several previous meals was lying around, which rather nauseated me. Just inside the door of the dining room was the refrigerator (\"x\"). [There is a diagram in the original dream report.] I peered into it, and the heat from the inside hit me in the face. It was revolting, I thought, to have butter and milk and eggs kept in a warm icebox! The little girl, meanwhile, had been unobtrusively following me around. I thought a splendid thing to do would be to clean the whole place thoroughly, and I had the feeling that by doing so I would greatly impress someone whom I wanted to make a good impression upon.  Evidently we made a good job of it, for the little girl thanked me profusely, and mentioned that her older brothers, as well as the two boys who lived upstairs, would certainly admire me for doing such a good job of cleaning! Interpretation The young girl reminded me of a schoolmate I had in the first year or two of elementary school. She had about the same appearance as my dream child, and although I never knew of her home life, I knew she was one of six children. Often I would bring her home from school to have lunch with me, and once I gave her a penny that my \"boy friend\" had given me. (I had not thought of this for years; thinking about the dream brought back these incidents).

I also tried to read what they were writing, but the smoke evaporated or disintegrated before I could read the words.  In spite of all this aerial activity, there was no noise. I then became cold and sat in the corner of the porch, huddled up, trying to keep warm. Interpretation Earlier in the evening of the dream I had seen the Goodyear blimp which has lately been floating over C. at night, flashing news reels along its side in Times-Square fashion, so, obviously, that is where the \"dream blimp\" came from.  My not being able to read it probably springs from the fact that I am near--sighted and would not be able to see it without my glasses. I have noticed in other dreams, however, when trying to read a book the print sort of melts away before I can see what it says.  The sky-writing of the planes, which was fluffy, pastel-colored stuff, may have come from a package of shipping-cream dye I had bought that day.

After some muddled activity, I was back in the living room of my own home, and the mother of a friend (boy) of mine was asking me to give her a wide silver filigree bracelet that I own.

There were two troops of soldiers also in the town who were friendly with each other although they seemed to be from different nations. one troop dressed in white uniforms and wore black turbans while the other troop wore khaki. My fiance belonged to the khaki group of soldiers. For some unknown reason the troops began to fight and those in khaki formed two lines--the first kneeling, and the second standing behind them. This made a perfect target for the troop in white, and in the fight my fiance was shot and killed. When I heard, I was grief stricken and especially because I was unhappy living with the blonde girl, and also had received bad news from my mother. The blonde continually stole my potato chips which angered me. The bad news was that my dog was very ill and my uncle had given him a blood transfusion. I was very upset.  Another elderly man had also given blood for my dog although the animal was not expected to live. (My uncle has been dead for about 8 years and he was about 71 when he died. He was not a blood relative, but lived for years with my mother's family and I always called him Uncle. He was very kind to me. The other elderly gentleman I cannot identify. My dog has been dead about 1-1/2 years and was 12 years old when he died. I cannot identify the blonde girl, but She was my age in the dream. My fiance is 23 years old.) Interpretation My fiance is away at school which may account for the foreign place. I may fear subconsciously, that he will be taken from me by another girl--symbolized by his death and my stolen potatoe chips, which in reality I like to eat. Perhaps I look on my mother as a bearer of bad news who adds one trouble to one already established. Answers to questions 2.

He began to molest me while I fought wildly and called to the passers-by for help. The people walking past were people I knew, but I cannot identify them. They looked at me as if nothing was happening, waved and smiled, and walked on. Interpretation In reality I probably miss the attentions of my fiance who is away at school and in order to stick to my principles I disguise any cravings in my dream in the form of an attack under very repulsive conditions. The people therefore seem to see me with my fiance and don't think anything is wrong.

Next I was in a class which was electing some committees. I remember seeing the words, \"Christmas\" and \"Easter\" on the board, and I couldn't see any reason for having to hold the election. We all dropped what we were doing & went outside. There was a beach and a bunch of girls & fellows were either building something out in the water or else were trying to hold a picnic on a sand bar. I seemed to be on the committee for the gathering and was called to the phone. It was some boy's mother, & she kept talking continuously & seemed interested in Boy Scouts. Meanwhile everyone was busy carrying things to the sand bar. By the time I finished talking all the work was done, & I remember going out in a boat with a gang. It was dark and the waves were high. Somehow I found myself in a bedroom which in the dream was supposed to be my girlfriend's bedroom. It was quite cluttered up, particularly the top of the dresser, and I was disgusted with the condition of it. The wallpaper was of huge red rose design. (In reality the girlfriend, who is 20 years old, has an entirely differently decorated room--although she is rather careless with her belongings.) Interpretation Perhaps this dream is concerned with my classes, for the day before I had the dream, I had a speech class & was told I was to prepare a speech for the next meeting. I do not like to make speeches. In another class we elected class officers, and I felt like it was extremely unnecessary to do it in college.

We went down a hilly business section of a small town and in the valley was the restaurant. It was called the \"L--- F---\" or something similar. On either side of the door were scenes from a desert showing cacti and Joshua trees. We went in & sat down temporarily at a table with some strange people. They weren't very congenial, and we didn't like sitting with them, so as soon as an empty table was available, we moved. While we were attempting to order, three older people pushed in on us and sat down at the table too. My fiancee had to sit on the edge of his seat for the woman piled her belongings, especially a big round purse, on his chair. The people were very friendly, but we wanted to eat alone and were quite upset. After eating, we went through a door and walked up an incline inside a building. I waited on the crest of the incline while my fiance went into another room. Soon he & a huge crowd of people swept out of the room. All were dressed as Hollanders and yet spoke Spanish. They were all happy and excited and eager to be on their way. My fiance spoke Spanish fluently with them, and I was perturbed because I could only speak a few words, although I understood them. They were going down to Mexico and were so happy. I remember trying to say in Spanish \"I wish I could go.\" I kept saying \"Quiero _______\"--can't recall the second word. My fiance stood with me talking to them & I kept saying \"Quiero _______.\" Interpretation I can't interpret the beginning of the dream, but perhaps the ending of it symbolizes the desire I have to travel.

Others who I cannot recognize were doing the same thing. We found a decoration for a package which we thought was wonderful and beautiful. It was simply pasting one narrow piece of tape (dark colored) in the middle of a wider piece of tape like this: This was a great idea in the dream. Someone who I was familiar with, but can't recall now, criticized my wrapping and I felt bad and angry too. I also remember placing a candle in each corner of a package for design like this:  I saw the words \"Medicine inside--Handle with care\" on boxes. It seemed to be concerned with the Pharmaceutical Co. my father works for as I talked with his boss. Everyone left except me and I kept wrapping. A colored girl came in to clean and then a colored man. I heard him say to the colored girl that he was going to pick all the pockets of the coats and the pocket books before the people returned to work. I was furious and tried to stop him, but he smiled and pushed me violently away. I forgot to say earlier that in order to wrap the packages we had to lick the tape. It tasted so bad and my mouth became sticky and dry, so that I could hardly swallow. It was awfully frightening and uncomfortable too. Interpretation The gym has been identified. I can't see the significance of the packages, although I had been at my fiance's for dinner and we ate by 4 candles. We mentioned the lovely design reflected on the ceiling. My fiance wanted more light to eat by, so we put on the electric lights. However he had eaten the night before with me at my house by 5 candles and said then that it was fine. We all commented on this. My fiance and I had used my parents' car during the day, and we had to park it unlocked. This worried me as it was loaded with some medicine, and I knew my Dad wouldn't like it if he knew, because of the chance of theft. Perhaps this accounts for the threat of theft by the colored man. As to the dry taste in my mouth, I can't interpret it. I have had this dream of a dry mouth which hinders swallowing and finally leads to a feeling of not being able to get my breath many times.

I was frightened, but solved the problem by having my father (who was evidentally with me) back the car out to the front, and I sneaked out the front door without being seen by the Indians. Next I found myself walking through a department store on the way to an offlce. I stopped and looked at clothes and talked to someone I knew, but can't remember now. I was all dressed up and seemed to be there for an interview for a job. I wore my fur coat, a square fur hat--which impressed me for it was so stylish; and also I wore a silk scarf which I remember. I sat in the office as if I was extremely confident. I talked to a young girl and an older woman sat to one side observing me and taking notes. I seemed to be on a higher social level than either in the office. Interpretation The evening I had the dream I had visited my girl friend with my parents. We stayed quite late, so I had to stay up even later when I got home to finish The Prairie by Cooper, which was due the next day: This book is about Indians and their wars and friendships with white settlers. I was worrled I wouldn't finish the book, but I did. Thus I got away from the Indians. My sister just started working with my girlfriend B. who told me how she was getting along. My sister has had 3 yrs. of college and is now in an office with girls who have had none--thus she feels rather superior to the job as a whole. I identified myself with my sister in my dream, for I'd like to be able to work to have money to buy some clothes, but I can't when I'm in school.

It read, \"Room 109, (my room) 1st grade, may use the gym at 4:08 each day.\" Interpretation I think both parts are wish-fulfillment. The first part is a desire to openly defy the principal. She is a fussy, finicky woman and I often feel like \"telling her off\" but I never have.  The next part is a wish to teach 1st grade next fall. It is the grade I like best, but I have recently been teaching the 3rd grade.  I don't understand the meaning of the time - 4:08. At 4:08 the children are not in school. Answers to questions 2.

It began on a boat where someone had been murdered (a male). The murderer had wrapped a snake around the victim's neck. I was suspicious of a tall, dark, young man, who was not good looking but had a beautiful build. As I recall, his name was Wade. However, after I got to know him we fell very much in love, and combined our efforts to find the murderer. The next thing I recall is that we were walking down a road to a farmhouse. Someone there told us to follow a road to find the murderer. We walked down the road, and soon Wade was far ahead of me. The road divided and it seemed to be very misty. I couldn't find Wade. There were millions of people walking down the road and I passed a young fellow who had been on the boat. I asked him about Wade and he said he had just been killed. I came to a hurst with two policemen in it. There were curtains drawn all the way around it, and the policeman peeked through and said Wade was dead. I cried through the rest of the dream! I then came to in an airplane filled with tunnels and people. I overheard the pilot telling the murderer he would conceal the murderer in the wing. I then realized the murderer was the young man who had told me Wade was killed. My father then advised and I told him where the murderer was. This is the last I recall. Interpretation The only connection I can make to this dream is my worry about my boyfriend being short! (about my height) The prevalent thing in the dream was that Wade was tall. When I awoke I felt as though I had been crying all night. It took a long time to get this dream out of my mind. No one in the dream was familiar to me, except my father.

She told me that if I went I would be killed. I remember feeling that I was being persecuted, and my sister was allowed to go while I wasn't.  Suddenly the scene changed and I was at college at M.

The only incident I recall is that I was angry and in this anger the only way of release that I seemed to have was to squash slices of ripe tomatoes over the parts of the machine which stuck out. This act seemed to be a retalitory act. Interpretation I do not have a definite interpretation of this dream. I can associate the tomatoes with the fact that I have always enjoyed eating raw tomatoes but why they would appear in an unpleasant dream is not clear to me. The presence of the machine seems to indicate the steady rigid pace of social custom, and since I had been forced to leave a party sooner than I had wanted to just recently; this dream might indicate that I found release for this frustration by being angry at the machine.

I was not able to distinguish them as to age but they appeared to be dressed as business men.  Action - A glider plane landed on the water close to the dam. The landing seemed to be smooth but actually it was a forced landing. I recall seeing the ship sink slowly in the water but recall no action until I saw the five bodies, in miniature size, lying together in the bottom of an ordinary pail. I did not question the fact the bodies had suddenly became so small and know of no reason for it. I was alone watching this action from a distance but later when I saw the bodies' our St. Bernard dog was with me. I experienced no dread, only surprised wonder and sadness. Interpretation I enjoy flying a great deal and for this reason the appearance of a plane is not novel to me. I must have gotten my ships a little mixed up though, for while the action of a ship landing on our pond is not new, since it occurred last year in the late fall, the ship was a heliocopter, equipped for amphibious landings. I was not at home when this occurred and was very disappointed about it, so it would seem that even though I was unable to place myself in the dream as a passenger at least I had the satisfaction of being able to see it. However, the feeling of sadness which I experienced upon the realization that people had been drowned in our pond is directly related to by conscious feeling of fear that someone, some day, may drown in our pond, for at its deepest end it is approximately 15 feet deep. The presence of strangers is most likely a manifestation of the new groups of people I have met here at W.R.U. The presence of the pail and the dog only served to make the dream more closely related to my past experiences. Answers to questions 2. Surprised and sad.3. Onlooker4. Unpleasant5.

Action - I had planned on meeting my father and brother (who is in the Navy now but was a civilian here) at this restaurant. I spent a good deal of time looking for them among the crowd but finally found them. Then we sat down to eat but had to wait a long time until a waiter promised to take our order. I recall that there were two student waiters who were very busy taking care of serving several older women. Sometime during the action, I recall bumping into the waiters and having to excuse myself. I recall no other action but I do remember experiencing frustration when I was unable to find my dad and brother and even greater frustration when we were unable to get the waiter to take our order. Interpretation I interpret this dream as a manifestation of my desire to have my brother at home again and in a more broad sense my desire but my seemingly impossible hope of making my father look with less cynicism and distrust at the general topic -college. In this dream I seemed to have failed in that endeavor again although I recall nothing of my father's reaction. The entire situation was not a favorable one for my point of view.

Interpretation This dream took place shortly before school started, which explains its content. The reference to 7:30 is easily explained as I intended getting up the next day at that hour to attend an activities program for new students. My mayor is Spanish. I had been a little worried about how well I'd do this semester, because I'm transferring from 0. During my two years stay there I lived in a dormitory.

            "content": "I dreamt that my 19 year old brother and I had just left our house and were walking down our street. From a distance we saw two people (don't recall sex) on the corner. They seemed to be looking for someone to antagonize. It did not occur to me that we would be the unfortunate ones. When they saw us they began to throw sticks and stones at us. We turned back and started running down the street. We crossed the street and went through an open gate in a backyard (unfamiliar to me except that I seem to have seen this gate and yard before in my dreams.)  We ran on for what seemed close to an half hour. Then we reached a side street and stopped--assuring ourselves that we were no longer being pursued. The street seemed to be in the neighborhood of S C Ave., which is about 20 blocks from my home. I asked my brother if he wanted to take a cab home and then before he had replied, continued that I thought we would be safe on a streetcar. At that moment my parents came into view. They had both very obviously been drinking and were tottering on their feet and grinning stupidly. My mother said that she had had ten drinks. Our car was parked on the side street and we decided to go home. We got into the car and just before we left a policeman came up and gave us a ticket for parking in front of a fireplug. We drove up to 1 st. and started down when I realized all of a sudden that we were in the midst of a parade. All the paraders were colored people. They began shouting that we could not ride in their parade. Interpretation I believe the reason my brother entered the dream is that he has been overseas for 1 1/2 years and I have been anxiously looking forward to his return this fall. I had this dream two days after I saw the movie \"G.\" Being of the J faith it naturally made a deep impression on me. Although I had never experienced any real difficulties because of my religious views, the picture brought out to me the many humiliating experiences which others of my faith have undergone. The whole issue of anti-semitism in the movie began with the invitation of Mr. S  (a J) to his apartment of some soldier's saying: \"What is the matter? D'ya think we're not good enough to drink your stinking liquor?\" The number ten may have arisen from the boasting of one of my young friends on the Saturday before my dream that he had consumed 10 bottles of beer at a picnic. The amount he had consumed greatly astounded me at the time. I cannot explain the fact that both my parents were drunk, as both drink very little. The difficulty we experienced with the policeman may have been due to the parking difficulties we have had of late. With reference to the parade of colored people, their place in my dream is probably due to the fact that we live in an almost entirely colored neighborhood and have been attempting unsuccessfully to find another house into which to move.

One of the patients is my cousin (a girl of 23), the other a middle-aged woman unknown to me, accompanied by her two children. The doctor examines the middle-aged woman and tells her bluntly she has cancer of the pancreas. He then examines my cousin and tells her she has cancer of the breast. My cousin burst out crying and ran into the next office. The rooms of the office are doorless. The doctor examines me and makes no comment. I go to the next room and see my cousin. She is holding a ring box and crying. A woman is combing her hair and comforting her. The middle-aged woman offers to drive the doctor (now a woman) home. The doctor asks the woman if she will also drive me home and she hesitatingly answers in the affirmative. It seems that she and I live in the same neighborhood. She drops us off at the corner of my street. Interpretation The doorless two-room office, I believe, may have been brought to my mind by the voting booths. I had noted for the first time that day and it left a deep impression on my mind. There has been a great deal of publicity of late with regard to Cancer Clinics, and I think the middle-aged woman in my dream symbolizes my aunt, who died of cancer two years ago. She, also, had two children. By cousin's presence may be accounted for by the fact that I am to be a bridesmaid at her wedding next month and have been very excited at the prospect. The ring box symbolizes her approaching wedding as does, I believe, the combing of her hair as if getting ready for the wedding. The voting booth was on the corner and I believe this fact corresponds to the last phase of my dream. The doctor, now, may be identified with my girlfriend--with whom I went to vote.

I recognize both of them as being co-workers of mine when I worked for the MMC three years ago. Another woman (just a blurred image) is dictating to one of the girls. She seems to be worried because the mail had not yet arrived. I go down to the basement of the building and look in my box. \"I find two notes. The top seems to be located in M A, but is on the wrong side of the hall. The notes seem to deal with some papers which I forgot to turn in at the bookstore. I am extremely puzzled. \"How could I have known about those papers when I am not a Mstudent, \" I say to myself. As I am standing by the box I see my cousin (a married man of 29) put a note in his sister's box. (She is 31 and does not go to M.) I then go to the bookstore which is also in the basement. I am told it is the wrong one. I go upstairs, still in search of the bookstore and meet my S prof (the one I had at OSU.) I seem now to be at 0. S. U. He asks me why I returned and I explain that I am no longer going steady. At this point my dress blows up and I have difficulty holding it down. Ask him to help. We admit that teachers seem to get along better with pupils in class than out. I walk away. Interpretation The two-room office here represents my advisor's office. I had been in to see her the previous day. The women from W. M. C. were probably brought to my mind because I saw one of them downtown recently and it had been a long time since I saw anyone from the office. The note I found in my box corresponds to the one I received from my advisor. She had advised me that through error, I had been placed in a class for which juniors were not eligible. She said she had not known about it (which corresponds to my statement that I could not have known about the papers.) My cousin probably entered my dream due to the fact that I was worried about him. I had heard that day that he was having marital difficulties and that his family (represented by his sister) were very perturbed. I cannot account for the presence of my S Prof. in my dream, nor why I should again be at OSU. The episode of the dress is equally unaccounted in my mind.

The teacher is speaking to us in German. (I don't understand her.) All of a sudden we see a man running past the window. He is carrying books. The teacher attempts to attract his attention, but fails. He comes into the classroom a few minutes later, wearing a shirt. I seem to recall that he wore a baby's bonnet on his head. He takes these clothes off or, at any rate, I later recall him as wearing a business suit. His features are very clear (face unfamiliar to me). I particularly notice that his teeth are not nice. He and the German prof. discuss the possibility of opening up another German class. The teacher again talks to us in German. The words are very long. I do not understand her. The young man leaves and says goodbye to us all. (Forgot to mention that I laughed almost hysterically when he came into the room. I remember the tears rolled down my cheeks.) In the second part of my dream, I seem to be near a football field. I am looking for my boyfriend, but cannot find him. The scene changes to the lounge of the dormitory at O. S. U. I am sitting on a striped-chintz love seat. My housemother comes into the room (aged 60). At the same time I see a girlfriend of mine being helped into a car. Someone says she is being taken to the Dean's office. My housemother approaches and asks me for my notebooks. She says the Dean is looking through all girls' notebooks to see if they have loud sentences written in them. I give her all but my psychology notebook which I fear may have some obscene words in it. I look through it, but find nothing. I see my boyfriend (age 20) and tell him what happened. He tells me he thinks they were wrong for doing it. The third phase of my dream took place in my living room. My boyfriend and I are seated on the couch. He attempts to kiss me, but I feign indifference. He calls my bluff and we kiss. Interpretation The episode in the German class can probably be explained by the fact that my boyfriend is taking German and experiencing difficulty with it. I remember telling him that I wish I knew German so that I could help him. I attempted to test him on a vocabulary list and we both laughed heartily over my pronunciation. The unusual costume of the head of the German Department brings to my mind the costumes sported by freshmen women the first week of school. The second phase of my dream would seem to represent my guilt feelings concerning sex. Of late I have noticed that my mind is frequently preoccupied with the subject of \"sex\" I have felt that my preoccupations were unhealthy. The episode of the psychology notebook escapes me. The third phase probably represents just plain wishful thinking. I hadn't kissed my boyfriend in a few days and was looking forward to it.

My girlfriend and I hasten toward an open window and jump out. The room we had been in was devoid of furniture. (Not too sure of last statement.) We quickly run around to the front entrance. We go into a large room. I see a handful of people sitting on what appear to be shoe-shine chairs. Their heads are all bent down and they appear to be very sad. I recognize my father. I seem to recall that some of the others were also members of my family, but I couldn't remember specifically who they were. Someone tells me that some of the members of my family are missing. Interpretation This dream has little meaning for me.

It was she who introduced us. Perhaps this dream symbolizes the family disapproval with which our indiscretion would be met.

I angrily yell at my mother for not having reminded me to get ready. We approach the house which appears to be an apt. bldg with an unusual number of steps leading up to the door. As we are ready to ascend the steps we are accosted by 2 boys. I ignore the one who attempts to speak to me, noticing that he has little hair on the top of his head. I say to myself that he has no more hair than my boyfriend. We go up to the apartment. The next scene is in a church. I am standing in front of a mirror. I look at my bridesmaid gown and discover it is extremely large in the waist. When I look again it has changed to a house dress. I remember feeling very relieved and reassuring myself that it wasn't the gown but the housedress that was too large. I ask someone (don't remember who) if there is a washroom somewhere. I enter a doorway and see a number of men milling around. I remember saying: Heads up. Interpretation The apartment is entirely unfamiliar to me. My cousin age 17, is to be a bridesmaid at my other cousin's age 24 wedding. This is the second dream I've had about her wedding. I explain it as due to my excitement at being a bridesmaid for the first time. My gown was being altered and I greatly feared that it wouldn't fit upon its completion. This probably accounts for the fact that it was too large in my dream. The housedress episode seems to symbolize my refusal to believe that the dress would be too large. The episode of the washroom escapes me, although I have had another dream in which a washroom played a part and also in which men were present. Answers to questions 2. Angry3. Actual participant4.

After we have ridden awhile my sister and I express desire to use the women's washroom. We stop in front of a building which resembles somewhat H. Chapel. We alight and go in. We find the women's washroom. It is an immense room which resembles none I've seen. There are many little cubby holes which I presume to contain toilets. However I did not see any. Each cubby hole was covered in front with a white curtain. However the backs were left completely open. I looked through the back entrance of the cubby hole and saw a long bench on which a group of men were sitting. I looked and looked but could find no cubby hole whose back entrance was also covered. I woke up. It was about 3-4 in the morning. I felt an extreme urge to urinate. Interpretation I cannot interpret this dream. I have never ridden in a station wagon nor expressed a desire to do so. We have no dog at home. Perhaps the dog was brought to my mind by the fact that everyday on my way home I pass a pet shop. In each window there are about 1/2 dozen puppies.

They are both unfamiliar to me. The man lifts the buggy in the air. He seems to be trying to get it over a puddle. I stretch out my arms and help him. I look into the buggy and wrinkle up my nose at the baby. The next scene takes place in an apartment. The same 3 people are present. The young mother attempts to give the baby a bottle. The milk is too hot. She tries to give him the bottle again; it is still too hot. She finally gives it to the baby and he refuses it because it is too cold. The man throughout this procedure appears to be hostile toward his wife. In the next scene I pass a mother (same woman) and a little boy on the corner of a busy intersection (unfamiliar). The boy is now about 4-5 years old. I can see his features very clearly, yet he, too, is unfamiliar to me. I again wrinkle up my nose at him and remember that I had done the same thing when he was an infant. I turn the corner and walk down a street. I past a store and look into the store window. I see my image. I notice that I appear just as young, but am slightly heaver in weight. Interpretation I have been contemplating marriage with a student of the University and have spent quite a bit of thought on the fact that I would not be able to have children for perhaps 4-5 yrs. I believe this child symbolizes the child I would not be able to have. That is why I believe, when he appears to be 4-5 yrs. old, I still look the same. I would analyze the man's hostility toward his wife thus: It has often said that a wife neglects her husband upon the birth of a child and I am determined to divide my love upon the birth of my child in order that my husband should not be deprived of any previous relationship.

I approached a stairway leading from the basement outside and see the outline of a tall, heavily built man, his back to me, bolting the door. I cannot remember seeing his face. Be turned around and I screamed for help. There was a leather couch down in the basement, exactly like the one found in the MA lounge. I can't remember details, but I got the impression that he attacked me. The next thing I remember is being outside, crying, and seeing my boyfriend. I rush toward him and bury my head in his shoulder. A policeman appears on the scene and at the same time my attacker. My boyfriend points the man out to the policeman, who takes him away. Interpretation Two possibilities occur to me in interpretation of this dream. Perhaps the dream actually represents a fear of being attacked. We live in a practically totally negro-populated neighborhood. I have felt a bit scared upon walking down the street at night, but somehow I don't think it would manant a dream of this type. Stretching the imagination a bit, I can see that it might indirectly point to a desire for sexual intercourse.

There are a few people at the table, but I'm not sure of their identity or sex. One of them has some cards which contain information for a source theme. I look them over, thinking that perhaps I can use the information, when someone tells me that it concerns E. (My theme deals with the A C) I see a woman and her little girl approaching. I remember thinking there was something very odd about the little girl. Her face was very different looking as were her clothes. I saw her features and those of her mother very clearly, yet they were totally unfamiliar to me. Her mother addresses her as The Princess. The little girl goes to put out a book, but a man enters the scene. I think he prevented her from taking the book. I remember that the little girl kept smiling. She appeared to be about seven or eight years old. The dream gets confused here. There seems to be a conspiracy to see that no one leaves the library alive. But, without speaking, there seems to be an agreement between the librarian and me to see that I leave unharmed. Interpretation I can well understand my dreaming about the source theme. It is due Wednesday and I haven't started it as yet. (writing it, that is.) The cards probably represent the fact that I feel I don't have enough information to write a source theme with. I put off the writing for today and have had no little anxiety concerning it. The episode of the woman and little girl doesn't bring anything to mind. Although the fact that she referred to her as the princess probably refers to the much publicised Princess Elizabeth's wedding. The episode of impending death would seem to indicate a fear of death on my part, but an uneacelingness to believe that it could actually happen to me. I confess to having given the matter a great deal of thought at various times in my life, but none recently. I know that I do not fear death, my only fear is that I may die young, before having experienced a happy married life and the joy of having children. Answers to questions 2.

Some voice says that they both have one interest in common: oil. I then see two pipes which seem to be going up and down. The next thing I remember is their being married and settled in an apartment. There seems to be a story teller in my dream. He says that this marriage is a triangle including the man, his wife, and his mother-in-law. The mother-in-law continually called her daughter to remind her of appointments, etc. In the next scene the girl is making supper. She opens the icebox and I saw a gallon jar in the icebox. It contained huge pink and red roses in a fluid. On the bottom of the jar there is a label which gives a company name and says they preserve wedding flowers. The girl then looks into the stove. I see what appear to be different types of leftovers (meat pie, etc.) being reheated. The girl wonders if there will be enough and says she will just eat a little. Interpretation I do not understand the \"oil\" element of this dream. This dream seems to be another of a series of dreams concerning marriage, which I am contemplating. I can well understand the occurrence of mother-in-law in the dream as I am a bit frightened at the prospect of acquiring one. I did not get off to such a good start with my boyfriend's mother and am afraid I may run into a little difficulty with her. The preserved flowers represent my proposed marriage, I suppose.

I seem to be wearing a wool dress of checked material. I get on an elevator going down, but when we get to the basement I notice the belt of my dress is missing. We return to the same floor and then find that the belt is in the elevator. I put it on, and at first it doesn't seem to match the dress, but then later it does. We return to the basement. The style show is already in progress. The audience seated in rows or benches, seems to be composed of all young people. A girl whom I know is master of ceremonies. She brings out a dog and a duck and says they allow no petting there. Then I wondered if perhaps I hadn't heard wrong, maybe she said \"We allow no pets here.\" One of the models has already gone on the stage. I wonder where the other models are and where we are to go. Another girl is with me, I don't know who she is. We go into a little building. One wall is off allowing us to see into it. I see girls lying in bed in P. J.'s studying. I then see a girl (who is in my S-- class). She is fully clothed. I ask her if she knows where the models are. She goes to the window and points to a small building. I ask her how I can get there. I think perhaps I can climb out the window, but when I look down I notice that it's quite a jump. I ask her if there is a back door and she says \"yes\" We go out the back door and see a group of girls standing in a row. I am particularly impressed with the variety of bright colors which they are wearing. I recognize one of the girls as my former roommate. She is dressed in bright yellow. She waves to me and shouts that she is getting her grades the next day. Interpretation The theme of my dream would seem to indicate a desire for clothes. My wardrobe has been quite depleted and I have been contemplating replenishing it. I have been pretty anxious about my lack of clothes as I do not feel as self-confident when I am not well dressed. My boyfriend, also, has been insisting that I buy myself something to wear. The appearance of the duck and dog, I guess was a convenient way to introduce the theme of petting into my dream. I am contemplating getting engaged and we have discussed the possibility of petting as a preparation for the intimacies of marriage. However, both of us decided we would have severe feelings of guilt if we did pet.

We were asked to come to the front of the room to hear a story. All of the girls sit down on small chairs. I sit down and then change my seat. Our teacher is a young woman (in her twenties, unfamiliar to me). Everyone had a white sheet in front of them with a pencil. I had no pencil, but tell myself that I will be able to remember.

Someone turns the lights off and I cannot find my crayons. I look in my box (resembling my evening bag) and see only two crayons. I look on the table and see a bunch of little stubs of crayons and some large ones, but can't determine their color in the dark. Someone (a man) tries to find the light but cannot. I become very angry. A girl (about 21, in my E-- class) comes up to me and shows me her hand, palm up. I see a ring. I turn my hand up and she says \"Oh, you've got one, too!\" I ask her if she just got hers. She says \"no.\" Her ring is smaller than mine and she says she couldn't wear my size. I tell her that my hand is proportionately larger. Interpretation This dream seems to tie in with the Christmas dinner we had at my fiance's home. The duck would seem to represent the goose we ate. After dinner my fiance and I had a discussion about how differently our respective homes were run- the fact that his mother was much more economical in buying and using her food and in furnishing her home. I guess the discussion raised a doubt in my mind as to whether or not he and I would see eye to eye on the expenditure of money. The episode of the ring is pretty obvious to me. I became engaged ~ few weeks ago and as is pretty common with girls, I wondered what others would think of my ring. I was also a little doubtful as to whether I liked it or not. The drawing and crayons I find difficult to fit in as I have no interest in them and can't imagine what they could symbolize. Easter probably represents Christmas.

I seem to owe her some money and she brings out a white slip with pencilled items on it and starts to figure. Interpretation The party probably represents the engagement party my mother plans to give in my honor quite soon. My cousin probably enters the dream as we were discussing the fact that she recently had a miscarriage. The scene in my aunt's home probably occurred because of the lengthy conversations I have had with my fiance, my parents and friends about the difficulty of finding an apartment and my wondering about how I would furnish it. The empty room can probably be explained by the fact that if we get a house or a large apartment we will probably close off one room as we cannot afford to furnish an entire house.

The dream was not definite on this point, but I believe I was working there and the doctors asked me to pretend that I was a patient to get some information about one of the women patients. I did this. We were in a ward. A large room with pillars in it and it had a marble floor. I was in a regular hospital bed next to the bed of the woman I was to observe. Her bed was similar to mine, except that hers had a cage-like affair over it so she couldn't get out. There was a trap door on it and it was of wooden posts with copper screening over all. We were talking and I was frightened at being a patient in such a place and petrified of this woman. She was pale and had large, boring eyes and stringy brown hair. She spoke to me and confided in me and I sympathized with her. I pretended I was a mental case, too, and told her I wished I were dead. Then, I saw her strong, powerful arms reach up and open the trap door on the cage over her bed. She said she'd take care of my body after I was dead. I knew she was going to strangle me. I wanted to scream but couldn't. My fear was overpowering. Then, I saw a nurse coming towards me (this nurse I recognized as the receptionist nurse I work with). The woman's (patient's) hands closed the trap door and she got back into her bed. Then, I fell back on my bed, my heart was pounding and I was weak. I wanted to cry. This nurse (who didn't wear a cap) and another nurse (unknown to me) wheeled my bed out and into another room. They said I had a one o'clock patient that I had to give an electroencephalogram test--then after I gave the test, I was to go back to the ward and keep pretending I was a patient. I was terrified. I said if that woman patient should see me in uniform and recognize me as a worker not a patient she'd kill me (I knew she'd strangle me) I became almost hysterical. What would I do? Then the dream ended as the 2 nurses wheeled my bed back to the ward. I was to stay there till one o'clock--time to do the test, etc. When I was back in the ward, I was weak and frightened. I lay there, opened my eyes and saw the woman staring at me, her eyes boring into me, suspicion written on her face and I lost all hope. I knew she'd kill me. Interpretation Can't interpret. The receptionist is a good friend to me. In the dream, she saved me from death. This may show how much I think of her and of her loyalty to me. I thought the doctor's place very unwise--for me to do the EEG test and then go back to the ward--it placed me in such danger.

Interpretation Our dog died Friday morning, November 28th and we all felt pretty bad about it. We had him since he was three weeks old and he died at the age of l4 years. Although he was old, he died more of pneumonia than anything else, I think. He had a bad cough that sounded as if he was choking.

I was walking to the pond when I met an old friend, whom I hadn't seen for a few weeks. He was going skating also, but had his boxing gloves instead of ice skates.

When we all reached the pond, we sat in a long row and were asked why the delay. I told the lady in charge that I had forgotten my skates.

She held up the bouquet and I admired it. Strangely enough there were carrots included in the assortment of flowers. She offered me a carrot and I ate it. When I returned home I found that someone had sent a bouquet of flowers and this surprised me. Interpretation This is rather difficult to interpret.

The place looked tremendously attractive. The buildings were painted in beautiful bright blues and reds. There were numerous neon lights radiating about. The above description makes the place sound rather garish but really there was a certain unique charm about it and we decided to stop there for awhile. It seems that I had heard something about this place before and from the conversation of my cousin it was apparent that it was very well known. When we entered I felt that I had once been here before, yet, I know of no actual place like it. We entered some sort of building which had a restaurant in one half and a photo studio in the other. A rather nondescript girl, employed at the studio, was showing us samples of their work in photography. The girl was rather young about my age, I imagine. The pictures were mostly bridal pictures.

Interpretation This dream may be a rehashing of some of the discussions in our education classes about the brilliant child.

My girlfriend next door is an artist and I have watched her do oils at different times. The fellow I was with was one whom I used to go out with quite often.

We passed the auditorium balcony where the rest of the school was having some sort of an assembly. The doors were open and we heard a boy make horrible noises on his accordion. The freshman class was very noisy, and I thought they should be quiet and not disturb the assembly. I got into an argument with one of the girls and told her she should not be so selfish. We continued arguing even when we passed into another hall. When we were through with the tour, our class met in one of the rooms where a woman was talking. I didn't listen, but talked to my girlfriend about my cousin and showed her a button he sent me from a New Zealand soldier's uniform. We wondered if the woman who was talking would know what the button was. The class was dismissed.  After a time, our class joined the other assembly. I was going to sit on the balcony, but then I saw a boy who I liked very much and I started to go to where he was sitting. There were about five, empty chairs near him.
