Joe Fong cut out beautiful, eery, disturbed pictures of blue houses and glued them against black and white skies. He left glue bubbles everywhere. I went down to the corner to wait for my sister. I waited and waited. A guy came by and said, \"What are you doing?\" And I said, \"I'm not sure. If I wait here my sister will walk by.\" He said, \"Then I'll wait for you.\" I climbed up the ladder to look and see a few of the cards we'd made but really they were junk. William accidentally threw a roll of paper towels out the window onto a busy Chinatown street. Then Carlos threw a stapler out the window. Then a stranger threw a wrench. We agreed it was time to pour wet cement. One inch thick and boards on sides. The Chinese children were running a scam. I could see the sunlight in little girls' hair. Golden sunshine sparkles. I looked over my shoulder for Dora. It was an old show from a TV that was playing. I walked up a steep staircase and was trying to find where we parked the car in Chinatown. I remembered kicking the door 3 times. On top of the building was s steep roof covered with tiny Chinese lanterns. I started stomping lanterns and a girl said, \"What's wrong?\" And I said, \"My sister used to love these.\" She said, \"Have you ever had a telepathic experience?\" And I said, \"Yes.\" An artist in prison was standing up on a desk. His cell was 8-sided with windows and painted yellow. He was sitting tracing his feet and trying to paint a comma, huge, in one window because, he said, \"What's behind it goes on and on, like what's behind corners. Endless words. Endless space. He was happy drawing."

I had to wait till the window washers were busy and distract them by throwing ping pong balls so fire hoses filled with cyanide could be squirted on passers-by. I threw a rock through a plate glass window. A thunderstorm had blown up from the south and a guy said I had to be real careful. (The job paid) $4000 to work Sunday through Wednesday with one day off. \"Now count the money,\" she told me, and handed me a stack of counterfeit bills. One five. Two tens, twenty-eight twenties and a $14 bill with (a picture of) millions of New Yorkers. She said, \"Leave or I'll shoot.\" I had to squirt the fire hose uphill to wash the bubbles out of the grass. Then the boss lady said, \"I had 3 men working for 4 days and had to shoot them with cyanide sulfide. CLEAN UP THESE BUBBLES AND CYANIDE. Count the $4000. Two of them have the day off.\""

Paula and the priest, left to get things ready but I saw cellophane packs of saltine crackers on the coffee table. 8 crackers to a pack. A guy was in church for the first time and I said, \"You know what they're gonna do with these crackers?\" And he said, \"What?\" and I smashed one pack with my fist. \"They do it that way at country churches.\" And he said, \"Oh, I better sit in the balcony.\" I said, \"It's the old Poplar Springs vs. Mount Gallagher thing.\" I put another pack of saltine crackers in my knapsack along with a Webster's dictionary and a bruised banana. (I was) working a job proofreading and there was copy spread all over the table. Newsprint catalogs with long lists of job codes. The boss man said something to hurt Dora's feelings and I screamed out, \"Don't you ever do that again! I could hurt your feelings if I wanted to.\" He said, \"Go ahead.\" I said, \"There's no reason to hurt someone's feelings.\" He said, \"Well I'll hurt yours. You're too quiet on the job.\" I laughed and said, \"I'm proofreading. What do you expect with foreign languages?\" A girl, Thomlina, came by and asked me where the boss was and I said, \"What do I look like? A goddamn secretary?\" The boss had been temporarily hidden from view, but was clearly working at the heat press wearing a blue shirt. I tried to find something in my knapsack and while I was looking I scattered things inadvertently all over the floor. A guy said, \"You are too messy.\" I said, \"It's my work station. It doesn't bother me. I do a good job. Just try to find a mistake.\" But all the while I knew I'd fallen asleep on the job. I couldn't fit everything I'd taken out back into my knapsack so I started making selections on what to keep. The only thing that was really important was my father's black Webster's dictionary from college with the caveman writing. Under the flap of my address book where business cards were suppose to go I'd put rice cakes and a slab of peanut brittle. On the loudspeaker the pilot said, \"All those going direct flight from LA to NY back to LA non-stop.\" I said, \"What's the point. You're just killing time. And anyway I was looking for the MetroNorth train.\" He said, \"Try the ground.\" I ran down the beach and there was a subway station in the sand. The red light was blinking and beeping. I ran. Other people were running. I knew if I missed the train I'd have to wait another hour (to meet Rudy). The sign said: <-- scenic tours Poughkipsee and I asked the token lady, \"Which way to NY?\" She said, \"Where in NY?\" I said, \"NY, NY.\" She said, \"The city or the state? I said, \"Both.\" She said, \"Not here.\" I said, \"How do I get there?\" She said, \"Go wait by that yellow house. About halfway back and a few blocks over.\" I said, \"Don't you know a street or anything?\" She said, \"It's the YELLOW house in the middle of the block.\" I asked a guy if he knew a street name and he said, \"Try Dobbs Ferry.\" I was thinking about Super8 films stuck on a broomstick like donuts and categorized with writing on white tape; or that was the eventual plan."

It cuts around the edges of corks.\" There was laundry going. Mine, Carlos's and Marianna's. Carlos said, \"Watch those clothes!\" I said, \"I'm watching,\" but really I had fallen to sleep. The clothes going in circles were hypnotic. I was watching Marianna's clothes because she was very busy. The clothes were dry and I took them out of the dryer. 2 bras. One was black padded with cheap fiberfill. Very Sears and very worn out. The other was clear translucent mesh with black feathers around the top. I meant to try them on but I forgot. Dirty plates and congealed gravy were left on the dining room table. My mother said, \"Rudy's just got back from this job interview. Merri, make some gravy with this water. Jesus could turn this gravy into wine.\" I said, \"Red wine on rice is not very good,\" because I knew they did not have white wine in the New Testament. She said, \"Well pretend there's wine in gravy and we'll leave Jesus out of this. There's water in the electric frying pan.\" Blue on Cheerios boxes had a subliminal message, \"BUY ME\". Scientific experiments were done at the grocery store to see if more people bought bright electric blue boxes or powder blue boxes of Cheerios more often. Ross was waiting for the bus and she said, \"Do you have 3 bucks to lend me for some soda and some water?\" I said, \"It's almost dark. The bank is closed so I can't get any money.\" She was pacing back and forth and sighing loudly in frustration. \"Can't you go down the hill to the bank and wait there all night for the bank to open? Can you send heavy eyeliner to Russia, and do you have 20 cents for the bus??!! (spoken frantically nervous and fast) I said, \"Lighten up\" Note: the next day I told Marianna about this dream and she said, \"Oh my god, I only had one worn out black bra from K-Mart and Les just got me a new black lace one.\""

I was trying to catch the minnows in my hands and cup my hands together to hold them there. The little fishy's iridescent scales sparkled in the sun. Dora was on the other side of the creek but no one could see her there in the sunshine. I caught 3 minnows and I could feel them flopping around. The invisible lady on the opposite creek bank was worried. I knew her husband had stopped flopping around and that meant he was dead. There was a tiny little boy in a birdcage. He was no more than 1/2 inch tall. He was swinging on the little bird swing like Tweety. I was making him a present out of a piece of red tape about 3 inches long and it needed a bow so I tore a piece of yellow paper that had sticky stuff on the back. I tore it vertically so it would look like a ribbon on the present. I was very excited to be giving him a present as he did not have any. I stuffed the present through the bars of the bird cage. The thing I wanted more than anything was sound effects from ambulances and she (Dora) went to all kinds of trouble to get these sounds for me. She knew I was intrigued by these and straight jackets. She communicated with me through a non-franchised fast food 'may I take your order' stand ((drive-thru)) The name of the old high school was Cecil B. Mills named after the black assistant principal Mr. (Clarence) Mills who could not speak understandable English. But half the letters had fallen off so they just rearranged the leftover letters to call it something else. Rudy had been hit and there was blood all over him dripping on his shirt and a photographer was taking pictures and I screamed at him to GET AWAY! Down the street at the grammar school the prisoners were doing the guarding and the guards got locked up. (Prison exchange program). You never knew quite what was going to happen next. Susan was sitting on the floor of the sewing room leaving Dana and Rover the blind dog a message that she had a present for them. \"A case of sodas!\" I accidentally hung up the phone while she was still talking but she couldn't hear the dial tone because she was still listing surprises so it was OK. I kept walking across the street and back with a card for tennis racket discounts that were in effect till September."

We were on a weathered unpainted tree house platform hooked up by pulleys on chains and had to haul ourselves to the top of the circus tent. Barbed wire was everywhere and it would be a tight squeeze to get out alive but the union workers appeared to help us, only they didn't do much except tell us what we were required to have, how many people it'd take to get it, and how long. \"What you need is some air,\" the guy told me. What he meant was that air was softer than barbed wire to step on. The union workers cut the label off a hug 6 ft. tall bottle of Clorox with an electric saw and drilled it onto the shovel of the bulldozer. They radioed for a bulldozer to get busy. Harvey was sitting in the library between rows of shelves learning to work the computer. A little boy next to him was playing a video game, eating french fries off the monitor. He had poured ketchup all over the top of the computer monitor and dipped each french fry into the puddle of ketchup. And a little boy to the left of Harvey was riding a bump car and the kid kept bumping the bump car into everything. I was at the library to research layouts for postage stamp design. It covered 32 different layout designs on a grid plotted on the coordinates of logarithmic equations. The equations were based on the intersecting points of the drawings and letters (type) on the stamps. There was a picture on a stamp about American families; a cartoon that was suppose to be like the Simpsons but they had the hugging happy family, instead of them hitting each other in the head with chairs. I was angry because the postage stamp portrayed American families as hugging when they really wanted to hit each other over the head with chairs. A skinny British man with a hat made from a cloth flour sack on his head challenged Peter O'Toole to a challenge of disintegrating into the sand. They were attempting to travel through the sand on their elbows and disappear into the sand. I wasn't sure what winning was, because whoever won would have already completely disintegrated into the sand and wouldn't be here anymore."

They were so happy to be dancing they started throwing their clothes all over the floor. The music was so good and I was dancing. But eventually we had to leave the hallway and go home. Between 5-6 p.m. there was an advertising meeting. They said at 5-6 p.m. they were either closed for the day or out to lunch or very busy with marketing and will get behind and then you won't get your paycheck. I knew I didn't work there anyway so it didn't matter. While she was still talking I just walked away and she didn't even notice she was talking so much. I went back to the classroom. In the time it took me to talk to that talker lady he had gotten a 4-year college degree in chemistry. We talked about the vertical strength necessary to balance out horizontal weight. The original 3 bank robbers robbed the N train which went through Belton Honea Path. They took the horses back in the woods behind the tool shed. The man asked me, \"Did you see any bank robbers?\" And I didn't answer him because he saw them too and I didn't know what he was getting at with that question."

He had gnawed up a carcass but you could see the left side of the hind legs. It was either a wolf or a cow. We locked the car doors. At our house on Maplebrook we'd never once had Doritos, but we had them. A big family bag. My mother said, \"If you eat those things you won't eat your supper,\" but she was eating them. \"They always make you thirsty,\" she said. And I got some water, because we never had cokes at home. \"I worked so hard on supper and now nobody's gonna eat their supper,\" she said, \"I boiled 2 eggs for supper but there's only one and a half left. A half is in the kitchen and a whole egg is left over from Easter. It's in that basket on the piano.\" But we were trying to concentrate on reading the newspaper. It had funny headlines. It had a picture of a local high school Christian group and the headline said, \"GOD IS MOD\". It had a picture of Coach O'Rear. And then on the other side of the newspaper it had a high school drawing that was so bad it was good. On the wedding page it had a drawing of a guy's girlfriend and he'd scrawled out in black crayon, \"Look at those tits.\" I was at a swimming pool and Dora was there. There was a swimming race. Dora was so calm. She said, \"There's no need to race.\" Everybody was talking about whether swimming with a wet suit would make you faster, or the color of the wet suit that would make you swim faster. That film changing bag when you put your film in the canister, when the lights aren't out in the darkroom, or when you can't have the red light on in the darkroom, or even the amber light? I was carrying that around waiting to go to the ladies' bathroom at church and Merri Lindley told me to hold her two pencils. \"Hold these two pencils and don't get them dirty,\" she said. I had enough to keep track of without having to worry about those two pencils. I put them in the film changing bag and all the time I was worried that they were going to poke a hole in it. When I got off the train at West 4 St station, the 8th St exit, on Greenwich St. was a new \"Gay/Bi\" Coffee shop. The sign was pink and brown and they didn't finish painting it. Profiles were painted on it sort of mod. I'd wanted some coffee all day. Their coffee had some kind of cocoa or chocolate flavor but I'd never tasted it before. I drank it through a straw. There were 9 employees but no customers. 2 guys and 1 girl X 3. It was getting dark and Ester said, \"Merri, I just happened to be in the neighborhood.\" \"What are you doing Ester?\" I asked. \"I'm editing a film about a rap star. His name is Sammy Junior Daby.\" \"You mean Sammy Davis Junior?\" \"No, It's Sammy Junior Daby.\" \"Oh\" I said \"You wanna take a walk?\"Evelyn asked me. \"I don't have my shoes. People in this city get so uptight about going barefoot. I'll walk halfway with you, but then I have to go walk around the tractor tire. It takes a lot of practice.\""

I figured if he wasn't there, they'd end up taking me to church so I said, \"I'll run and meet you there.\" I was wearing my camouflage army pants and Uncle Bob quoted a bible verse and my father yelled out, \"FIRST THESSALONIANS!\" I said, \"Dad, I didn't know you knew any Bible verses.\" He just laughed and said, \"Would you get me some army surplus pants at Macy's?\" I looked around but I did not see any army surplus pants--there was one (pair of) Levi's rip-off, non-authentic army pants. While I was waiting 2 little kittens came and played. One was black and very little and young. The other was months older. The little kitten was making worms out of (blue) play-doh and eating them. Dora said he was trying to communicate that he needed to have some worm medicine. I could even see her watching the little kitten and could tell she was very concerned. She loved the kitty. The older kitten was a bit more reserved. I'd been wearing army pants for the archaeological dig--hieroglyphics on slabs of stone from Egyptian pyramids and tombs. The 5 inch slab of rock had hieroglyphics all over it and the scientist was scraping out dirt with a screwdriver. He'd scraping hard and fractured the Egyptian stone and said, \"Well, we might as well go ahead and smash it. It's broken anyway.\" And he lifted it up and threw it down on the floor."

I had a parachute man bout 4 inches tall and green plastic, and the parachute was white plastic connected with white sewing thread. I was getting my parachute man ready to throw him up in the air. I'd been making earrings. Circles with different centers. The dimension of the inner circle was about .75 as the outer one. Other earrings were oxidized dimes on the 'heads' side coated with shiny stuff to keep rust from getting in your ears. The CIA Bomb Squad was setting up bobby traps and wiring the aluminum fold-up tables with explosives. The children liked to sit under the aluminum table and I knew the CIA was going to blow them up. There were triplets who were about 5 years old, who came to the garage to play. They were wearing footie pajamas the color of lime sherbet. There was a basketball goal but no ball. The older children came to play--unaware they were about to be annihilated. They tried to detonate the bomb underneath the aluminum tabletop. Christy was waiting on me. She did not want to go play tennis. I was playing the piano and she said she was tired of waiting on me. I had NO INTENTION of going. Instead I climbed up on the roof and looked at the shingles.

I was lying down on the bench where you were suppose to sit and put my head under the shelf desk there. He said, \"Are you keeping your elbow underwater?\" Then we discussed aspects of human behavior. I waited amidst the junk cars across the road from the factory. The driveway was a dirt road. The people couldn't run anymore so they just sat there. You could watch the factory people come and go. There was a film maker there and I had to ask him a question. Something about palettes. He said, \"Well, that'd be good.\" People would go in the factory and go back out. They were whispering. Their heads would disappear behind the pine trees. I left the factory and came back and there was a lady; she had gray hair. The police came and yelled, \"Everybody down on the ground. And if you didn't get down, they would \"BAM\" knock you down to the ground. The cop went up to the older lady and pushed her down hard onto the dirt. It was a dirt road. I thought he was going to stab her, but instead he kissed her. I thought, \"What's going on?\" The girl from \"X\" (the band). We got thrown off the stage and she was screaming about the sound levels. We thought we could stall them to come down off the ladder off the high stage, but the crowd was too angry. Marianna was there. I was in the East Village near a trash dump and I saw all these pots and pans somebody had thrown away. I needed one but I didn't want to carry it, so I just left them there. I was enjoying a run in the rain, when I ended up at college. People were not learning very hard. I saw a picture of a bunny rabbit and ducks and a snowman. Instead of coal for buttons he had little pieces of wallpaper. There were flowers and it was very interesting. So was the duck. There was a dead bird that had been dipped in paint. There were also lavender feathers across one wingspan (8-12\") and somebody had attached a funky little (1\") baby doll inside the wing. It was not a sissy baby doll. The baby doll was glued inside half a broken eggshell. There was a lady who had been keeping an icebox on the roof. Inside it she had milk and a spoon and some sugar for corn flakes. She had some Cornflakes too. As far as I know she was an opera singer. She was making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I said, \"What are you doing?\" She said, \"I found her stash. She keeps it under the table.\" I saw the Cornflakes box and there was a chicken on it. Then the cops came up there. When she came tearing through the kitchen door, they said, \"Hold your fire! It's just Marianna. When we find him we'll have to shoot the perpetrator.\" Marianna turned into the girl from X and I was holding onto a rope from the ceiling that held Marianna up on stage. The guy in her band was trying to put on a swim cap so he could put on a wig. We were suppose to pull up the ladder like pueblos but instead she threw the ladder into the crowd. I had gone running in the rain and stopped at the old YMCA and a guy in a room told me about the officer and in a suit and he said, \"Hey, You have blonde hair.\" For some reason I decided to roll my hair and it was a defective hairstyle. I said, \"I'm going out.\" The guy I had seen the previous night saw a white tee-shirt and he said, \"This would look nice on you\" and I tried it on and it was wonderful. He had on a Sunday suit and shirt that was very narrow so you ((he)) could not move both arms at once."

The second time I took the subway; I did not know where I was going. Mostly because my room was a mess and starting to smell and I needed to ask someone if I could take a shower in their bathroom because there was too much junk on the floor of my shower. On the train I met people from foreign countries. Many OBVIOUSLY different nationalities were speaking shared languages--though 3 or 4 conversations in different languages were going on simultaneously. The guy asked me, \"Where are you going?\" And I said, \"I don't know.\" And he said, \"What?\" And I said, \"I don't know.\" And he said, \"What?\" (for the third time) And I said, \"I don't know. \" ...and he looked at me funny so I said, \"I can't pronounce things because I have a cold.\" And he said, \"Oh.\" When I got to the diner at the 23 St. exit my bike was parked outside and had a tag that said, \"FOR SALE\" and I was about to tear it off when I saw a note in red ink that said, \"Merri, I paid a visit to your bicycle on your mother's front porch. -- Love, Zeb\" I was so happy Zeb had been somewhere close to me even if I had been asleep. I'd been collecting banana stickers and sticking them on everything around me and then the sticky stuff and 2 paper layers started coming apart. I went out walking. I was in search of army men--whole bags of them at the 99 cent store. There was only one bag of army men but I only had one dollar."

You had to carry as many packs of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands, knowing full well it was the only time and place you could ever smoke again. You had to carry as many packs or cartons of cigarettes as you could hold in your hands and pockets--according to how much money was in your pockets and how much you could carry. They chose to smoke or not to smoke as part of the game. But to win you had to smoke a whole pack of cigarettes in 10 minutes. 20 cigarettes. In 3 rounds of the game show only girl was able to do it and she did it with ease. Those who chose not to smoke had to answer difficult geography questions. One lady dropped a bunch of packs of cigarettes and was tripping all over them and smoking flawlessly, using only one hand. We going to a picnic and my mother said, \"There is no iron in any of this food!\" Even if it is red or is meat.

She handed me this big cup (like a big gulp cup) and said, \"We're going to test you for 3 chemical deficiencies.\" I knew she meant for me to pee in the cup. I didn't say anything. I just kept looking at her like I understood what she meant, but when I opened the door to go to the bathroom, I walked away. Fast.

And I said, \"No.\" He said, \"Our hair is the very same color. On me it's called brown. On you it's called blonde. That's because I'm a boy and you're a girl.\" He (the unidentified psychiatrist) was practicing writing, back there behind the newspaper. He had a yellow pad and an ink pen. He was practicing his cursive and he was doing very good. He was concentrating very hard. Then he remembered about the tape recorder and the confession of the murder. So when it was time for me to come in he was still behind the taped up newspaper in the doorway. The newspaper was not any further away than his knees. He said, \"You can come in now,\" and he punched his arm through the newspaper. Then you could see him. He just ripped the newspaper. \"You know, there are some people who are going to tell you that horses are not allowed in the hallway. Personally, it doesn't bother me but I'm just telling you, some people are going to give you a hard time.\" I was telling him about horses' respiratory systems and why they can run so fast. I went into the garage and there were these boots sitting on top of the 50 gallon oil drum. I thought they were beautiful, until I realized they were imitation army boots and not the real thing. The fake boots had 3 inch cork heels and this made me mad. They didn't even have real shoestrings. They had imitation eyelets and zippers on the sides. When I lifted it I knew it was just too lightweight to be an army boot. In the room I had been looking for books of Dora's about kitties and about flowers. My mother said, \"Merri, where did you put those books? I can't find them.\" I said, \"I know they're in a safe place. They were Dora's books.

When I got about halfway there, I heard somebody yell, \"Merri.\" So I stopped. They said, \"your name has been pulled out for SAG's film version of jury duty. I can tell you right now you're going to be on the jury for a month and a half.\" The Sag group was on an island and I was trying to figure out how to get off the island to the left of NY with the moat around it (the island). I knew it wasn't too far to swim, so I left my roller skates, my bag and bag of laundry and tried the water. The water currents were run by electricity with waterfalls and suckholes that were powered by electricity too. What looked like rocks from the outside was not real rocks, but metal rods like those that build roller coasters. The metal rods and screws formed a framework and sheet metal was hammered over it. I looked like real rocks. The current (that) took me underneath and the waterfall was run by a machine just like the underside of a lawnmower but much bigger. It had a huge rotating blade that cuts. It came close to chopping me up. I was worried it would chop up my Mozart sheet music. I was in line at the grocery store. A guy in front of me shot a girl for talking too loud. He killed her. The moat around the SAG island was to make the jurors stay there even if they wanted to leave. I had tried to fight the currents and almost got chopped up. I thought about trying to roller skate across the river's floor, but I knew the skates would be too heavy and I'd have to leave my stuff. I finally decided to leave the rollerskates, bag, and laundry behind and try to escape. I acted like I was an enthusiastic juror, though I kept talking about what I needed to be doing. I was making an escape plan. According to SAG rules, I knew they had to take a lunch break. So I said that I'd go out to Wendy's and get stuff for everybody but I needed to use their boat. I put a cigarette out on the rubber raft because there was no ashtray. I hoped no one would see the smoke. When I got to Wendy's things looked different. There were 3 menu choices: salad on a stick. carrots and raisins on a stick. pineapple and coconut on a stick, and cantaloupe not on a stick."

The sticks were the diameter of a bobby pin and about 18 inches long. Cantaloupe was the only thing not on a stick so I ordered that and ate it the way we did on grandpa's farm. The cashier and I were having an argument about the way cantaloupe should be eaten. I said it was a question of geography--and the way I ate cantaloupe was proper farm etiquette."

I decided to do something about it. I decided I would either talk out loud to Roseanne or type a letter. Then I got on my bicycle and I forgot about it. I was riding down the outside edge of the railroad track cross ties. On the other side was a subway train. I was in between the train tracks and the subway tracks and trains were coming in both directions. I could feel and hear the bike going, \"ba-bump ba-bump\" on the train tracks. The mechanic was projecting gears onto the sky and the metal was metal-colored and shiny. The gears moved in the sky. Miller Lee, who'd signed many contracts and screwed them all up said that last week's projection was upsetting to him. The American flag was projected into the sky with a banana stuck on top of the flagpole. I didn't know why that would upset him when he was so mean. The mechanic was working just south of the train station. The case worker's assessment said that I had accuracy problems and did not notice boundaries and to compensate with maximum efficiency they would give me the smallest room because I was least likely of all people to notice. I knew they were wrong and the opposite was true but I had a bicycle to ride and could not dwell on this topic so long. One empty room's view had a view of a university in the shade. I rode my bike and I stood against the fence in Grandfather Anderson's driveway. Their house was empty. After a while a girl, Gina, with red tattoo of a little girl on her arm (Gina was only about 12 herself) rode up and put her bike in the garage. She walked like she knew where she was going. I asked her, \"Do you live on the 14th floor?\" She said, \"No, I have been living here for the past 3 months. My father lives here too, but he's never here.\" \"What are you doing?\" I asked her, and she said, \"I'm writing a business plan for Mr. Anderson.\" I knew she meant Grandfather Anderson and not my father. my father was not so interested in business. I said, \"We live right down the hill through the woods or by the road if you go down the hill turn left and the second house on the right; if you need help.\" I was angry Grandfather didn't ask Rudy to write it and didn't ask me if I needed a bigger place to stay."

A lady in a wheelchair had balancing rods like a cross between 'Wheel-O's' and perpetual motion machines. She was trying to balance a cup of coffee on the iron spokes, but the bottom of the cup was round, so it would NOT balance. I went to the drugstore to get some film and when I got up to the cash register after waiting in line so long--that I had to balance mathematical equations while in line. When I got there, I said, \"I need a roll of 400ASA 36 exposure tri-X.\" The guy found it. I said, \"Oh, I forgot. I don't need it after all. Jasmine will give me a roll in class tomorrow. I'll get some plastic notebook sheets and some tape.\" He brought back a 6-pack of tape and after he rung it up, I said, \"Oh, I only need one.\" He was angry by this time. But he got the plastic sheets wrong anyway. I did not ask for the other kind--I hadn't known they existed but they were exactly what I needed. I was so excited about working in the darkroom that it was hard for me to keep my clothes on. Next to the east River, Rudy had just gotten home from boxing class. His girlfriend was standing on the left. I didn't see her at first. I'd planned a breakfast picnic for Rudy. I had fixed scrambled eggs for breakfast but I accidentally turned the water spigot on and got water all in the bowl of scrambled eggs so I drained the water out and pretended I had not screwed up breakfast. No one ate the eggs. A deranged homeless guy was throwing a pitchfork at the cop next to the railroad. He screamed, \"Aim for the eyes!\" I had been crying over Dora on top of my bed.

I had to sit on the floor and sew and I was getting a little confused. I was making a quilt, but what I was making was these smocks with a white round tab circle collar. I was trying to fold the smocks into squares and make them into a quilt, but there were too many poofy layers of stuff. So I just put it down and started on something else because I didn't want to be sewing. It didn't particularly interest me. Ron was in the garage and he said he had a piano he didn't play. The piano was stored in the basement that he never played and I was carrying around my blue Mozart book. It hurt me that he had a piano he didn't play. I went to Paula's and Claire said, \"Will you help us load the dishwasher?

There were big spoons inside of spoons. Big stirring spoons and a soup ladle. Paula said, \"Surprise, it's your birthday!\" It wasn't but I acted like I was happy about the party. On the ship there was a book and the book was about drugs and how each drug worked and interesting things about the drug. I was flipping through the book and I saw Dramamine. It had different ways you could use it and the chemical equation and a little picture of what it made you feel like. It showed one itsy bitsy cotton ball in a big empty brain. The next drawing had 3 or 4 cotton balls squashed in an itsy bitsy brain. The next picture had about 20 cotton balls stuffed in the brain. The last picture had about a million cotton balls stuffed in the brain. What it meant was there was a whole lot of nothing going on. Dramamine, CO2, poppers, ammonia and alcohol were listed with the cartoon drawings and the chemical formula. I didn't know so many household items could do other things. A very anonymous guy was extremely nervous on the elevator because he was a junkie and he needed his fix. The other book was a kid's book about the letter \"A.\" There was a drawing of a little girl and she WAS the letter \"A\". Even though we were not suppose to take a break from physics, I wanted to have story hour and read this book (about the letter \"A\"). I sort of liked the pictures but I sort of didn't. It was not how I would have drawn her, but she expressed something. She had on a dress and the book was very thick. I was looking at the book of chemical equations, but people expected me to be looking at the kid's book. Paula came into the room. She told me about 3 other books about the author (of the 'A\" book). I was sitting on the floor in her room and she came in because she smelled something burning. I had accidentally burned the wax paper pack of graham crackers . Burned them black. The burned wax and burned cookie smell was bad. Paula said, \"Come on out to the party,\" And I did. There was red wine and white wine and alcoholic punch. Relatives from my mom's side were concentrating hard to avoid touching any alcohol punch. Aunt Joe lifted up the punch dipper and slurped it real loud and said for me and Rudy not to do that. She said she slurped the punch to find out if there was really any alcohol in it, and they were not just trying to conserve the punch. But I knew she was trying to get drunk. 2 Mexican boys were riding burros or donkeys--going up and down, back and forth, back and forth on the overpass, yelling. They were laughing and yelling in Spanish and having a good time. They were riding with no hands (hands in the air) and the donkeys were running upright on their 2 back legs."

Dora was there. She was so happy because we were making the Chef-Boy-Ardee pizza. We were waiting for the dough to rise. I had mixed just a little too much water and it was all sticky. Some other people were there and me and Dora were in the back seat. We went to a place with a name... something to do with 'tick'. On Second Avenue I saw Ronnie Haynie. He was very busy talking to himself like he always did. His eyes were wide open. His hair very blonde and straight and long. Dora was here and since she was here we decided to go to the tennis courts. I didn't think that was possible but it was.

Not me. I was just there. I got home and Dora was there! She had made a bed for me on the floor and when I told her about not getting any sleep she listened so sweetly to me. She cared. She had washed clothes for the trip and even washed mine while I was taking a nap and she washed the wrong clothes but I did not want to hurt her feelings. Her feeling mattered more than what I wore. Dora had baked 7 kinds of fake pastries and cakes (they looked real but you could not eat them--they were to be thrown and hit with plates for good luck. We were just about ready when Dora pulled off the top white tablecloth to reveal the carefully laid out pastries and fancy set table. She showed us how to throw the pastries and break them on the floor or plates for good luck. ((she had learned this custom on her international travels)) I wrapped a bible style turban around my head to keep the sun out. (of) Dora's pastries, 1 out of the 7 was tigers and when you squeezed them they would growl and attack the elephant pastries. I saw what I thought was a fake alligator in the creek--he was aqua green and bounced like a children's float. But he bopped downstream and attacked--he chomped the ducks. My father got the horses ready for the wagon trail and I walked behind the Crenshaw barn and found a commemorative 75th anniversary of the blacksmith iron table in the ashes. Evelyn had a film to shoot and she was sitting on the floor making plans. She said dresses would be cooler and that as many as possible would roller skate on ski-ropes behind the wagon like water skiers. The wagon went 70 m.p.h. and there was even a wipe out but Evelyn caught it on film. The white horse had been hammered in the forehead with a nail and a circle of blood was on his head. A jealous horse was the suspect. Part of kitty's face was caved in but I played with her and somehow got her face back right and her eye opened and she was SO HAPPY. She smiled and smiled."

The stuff came out on the page, \"x j l k , x j l k , x j l k , . \" But the letters were not in straight lines. They went up and down and up and down, in a sort of 'Navajo-ish' pattern on the page. I didn't say anything. I tried to type out some words. The patterns were nice. There were no vowels. I tried to type in a straight line but I could get no vertical action on the typewriter.

In the center of the massive round stone building was a room with a record player on the floor. Dora was picking out records and playing them. She played rock n roll songs we'd both loved in the 70's and early 80's. The songs she loved made me so happy I started dancing by myself. I was so happy listening to the music and dancing that my feet left the ground for short, and then longer increments. I became so happy with Dora that I started flying in the music room. I used my hands as rudders and cupped them in the shape of treble or bass ties in music scores, depending if I wanted to go down or up. I followed the air currents and was taken around the perimeters of the room. The air currents kept me from bumping into things. I accidentally made 2 guy (male) gymnasts fly with me.

I was going too fast to stay in the music room, because of centrifugal or centripical force, and the small size of this room in the center of a circular building. I could go frontwards and backwards. People didn't look at the ceiling out of habit of nothing being there. I could see people working cleaning and waiting tables. And setting tables. I heard my name. It was Alicia and her girlfriend Joshua. They ran and ran after me and when I finally saw it was them I came down to talk to them. We laughed. They distracted the employees with stories that I was pregnant. And we were laughing because they were lesbians and pregnancy was not an issue. To escape from the huge round stone building without being found out, I had to fly out the basement door. Tom Haney was working taking people's coats out to their cars. There were commuter jets that exited from a trap door and orbitted the sphere that was that specific universe of the building. They were fighter jets and five of them came from the trap door; one at a time and in formation. Astroturf grew on the outside of the sphere and I had to hold on tight to stay grounded. The jets come within inches of my back, inches from annihilating me."

Through this lottery a brother or sister could win the chance for their sibling to come back to life--but if you 'won' you gave up your own life. The committee killed you--I saw the committee and it was worth getting killed to give Dora a chance to come back for a while. My mother got real mad about me taking too long to fill out my lottery ticket for Dora's life. She thought I was afraid to die when really I was just looking at things. There was a 5 senses machine where family members could re-live moments--happy moments--and the last moments of life with their brother or sister's lifeless body, but very alive in the brain and soul. Evelyn was telling me about her trip to the White House. She said the 2nd lady (wife of the vice president) was breast feeding on the White House lawn; and she introduced Chuck over the loudspeaker as Springsteen. She said, \"Chuck Dean, American. As American an icon as Springsteen.\" And Chuck said, without smiling or any expression, \"I'd prefer to be compared to George Bernard Shaw.\" Alan and I were proofreading and there was a particularly long typositor order, marked\nwith\nbreaks\nevery\nword\nlike\nthis.

Clothes were all over the floor and there were a bunch of loose dollars. The dollar bills had flowers all over them and they were (bright, almost hot florescent) blue, pink, purple and white. They were BEAUTIFUL! I was worried I wasn't sure what we were going to do in the class, but Greg said, \"It'll be fine.\" I said, \"I thought we'd make half clocks.\" Only the numbers 12 through 6 would be used. I wanted to let the 6-year olds cut out their own numbers. Dora came back in and said, \"You found your pants. I knew you would.\" She was very calm. A lady came in to Bible School. It was Ackerman's mother. She had a beige shawl around her shoulders and a beige sweater. I wanted to go give her a hug because she looked extremely nervous."

We were to leave on the 3rd of the month but we had not seen each other in 6 months. I had $15. I looked on the sale rack and did NOT see anything I even halfway liked. They were all very extremely UGLY. The only one of any merit was the bathing suit made out of wood that looked like an Eskimo totem pole but I thought it would not be good to swim in. The lady said, \"Go try this on.\" And I followed her and... She yelled, \"NO! Go in there and take your clothes off and lay down on the floor.\" She would then hold up the bathing suit next to you to see if it fit. It was the store's new shoplifting prevention policy. Since $15 was only enough for the sale rack I went to another department. On the way I pumped some lotion from a display counter and put it on my arms and legs. I saw the signs and a stretched out beach towel in mid-air--it was a gimmick. The sign said, \"Fake Male Model Beach Towel $262. Get 2 for $300.\" I thought it was very overpriced, though it was a nice, thick, white beach towel. I was life guarding and it was boys' swim and there were little boys under the age of 12. Some had trouble swimming and the 50-60 year (old) adult confiscated all their floats. He said it was because their noise was unbearable. So the unknown and invisible superhero sent underwater attack tigers out in the water. First they clawed the man underwater and you could see streaks of blood disperse in the water. The streaks were the width of tiger claws where they sliced into the man's flesh. Just when the tiger was about to need to come up for air, the invisible superhero wrapped his tail around the knees of the Chinese karate guy so that they would get tangled up and bonk heads like the 3 Stooges. When I walked inland from the lake there was a left-handed girl learning to play the guitar. I was trying to help her but could get no closer than 15 feet away. I was right handed and she was left handed so our images were flopped and it was hard to help learn guitar from 15 feet away . She finally got the 'E' chord right and was playing it real good. Rudy and I went to college registration and my father said, \"I don't want any of that class stuff. I'll just lay here on the bed and rest until you get back from class and we can do something fun.\""

My mother said, \"if that man can afford a beach house, he should at least buy some decent clothes.\" Finally my mother drove right off the road and onto the beach. I wanted to say (that) there was a much nicer beach, but I knew it was best to keep my mouth shut. I told Britta, \"There's undertow water currents between the islands. Try not to swim there or you could drown.\" I knew this was hard for her to hear because her sister drowned but Dora let me know I should warn them. Dora said (that) if she was here, she'd know NOT to swim there. It was dangerous. Valerie's dad said, \"My daughter drew this picture.\" It was a vertical list drawing of a banana, a peach and purple grapes. He said, \"She's only in first grade but reads at a 6th grade level.\" We knew he was lying because Valerie did not read so good. Even by 6th or 12th grade. Then he made her join the army because he said she was a loser. The sergeant was sitting in a straight chair. I was sitting on the floor with Valerie's head in my lap rocking her. She was crying. The sergeant had been mean to her. I started singing, \"Do you remember.....that kind of September....\" And the sergeant said, \"That song's too sad. Don't you know some happy ones?\" And Valerie sat up and we all 3 (me, Valerie and the sergeant) started singing together in unison the \"SUNSHINE, LOLLIPOPS, AND RAINBOWS EVERYWHERE!\" song. \"Sunshine, lollipops and rainbows, when you're near me everything is wonderful when we're together. Brighter than a lucky penny, when you're near me, all those rain clouds disappear when we're together!\" When we were walking on the beach we were looking for shells and we had been singing the B-I-B-L-E song. \"The B-I-B-L-E (spelled out in song, similar to the B-I-N-G-O song, but a different tune.), Yes that's the Book for me! I stand alone on the Word of God, the B-I-B-L-E, the B-I-B-L-E...\" We were looking for shells and I was digging with my foot and uncovered wooden eggs with houses' faces painted on them. The wooden butterflies were cheap, cheap, cheap and the church family wooden shells (eggs) were boring. Then, digging with my foot to get the butterfly wings, I uncovered a long red ribbon of World War II medals on a red ribbon. The buttons (attached to the ribbon) were funny.

Dream tape recorded after daylight. ) At the great big university pool, that's called a natatorium, the floor was a clayish sandy color and rubberized, so your toes could grip good. A small group of grown-ups was sitting cross legged on the side playing a game that looked like marbles. But the marbles were round symbols of the state of South Carolina. They were in 3 separate code colors: (there were actually 4 colors; silver, gold and white. But there were many white marbles. There was only one bronze colored marble--it meant the same as the white ones but was much more valuable because it was rare. One of the 'marbles' was really the top of a palmetto tree, but chopped off, so it really looked like a furball. The other was suppose to be the moon. {{the palmetto tree and moon are on the SC state flag. White on an indigo background.}} I forgot what the third one meant, but it meant something. The grown people were playing marbles with the state symbols. I had to walk around the pool. I tried to remember that lady's name who was my WSI teacher at USC-M-O-U-S.... but I couldn't. I remembered Butterball's name. She was sitting on the floor talking to Butterball. The thing that I couldn't remember was why I was there at the pool. (Walking around the pool) I was carrying a cooking pot with some leftovers from supper in it. And it was leftover beef stew. It was in a pot with a handle and I didn't have anywhere to put it. I couldn't put in the water. If I put it down on the rubberized floor it would probably melt it. In my other hand I was carrying the state symbol marbles. I didn't have any pockets to put my marbles in. On the way up I had to sit in the car with this girl and she was driving me crazy. I tried to remember what she was so riled up about. But she was very angry about something and she kept going, \"eek eek grrrr grrrr augh augh.\" She was a filmmaker. We were doing a film shoot about prostitution. I was busy messing with the camera. I took the whole roll of pictures of these 2 shoes; men's work shoes (that'd been) spray painted black. The were aligned heel to toe but one was floating about 2 feet up in the air, so it looked like somebody was walking up steps, but just the shoes--not the person. I took all my pictures of that. The lower shoe was propped up on an aluminum can with the label peeled off. The shoes belonged to Woody Allen. We were going around the city because we had to do this film about prostitution. And this girl was just BOTHERING me and she wouldn't leave me alone, and I didn't have any money to give her. So after a while I just hauled off and I bit her in the arm as hard as I could. I bit her so hard that it was bleeding and you could see teeth marks on her arm. Then she was all self-righteous and she said, \"OH, I'm going to have to go to the hospital and get a TETANUS SHOT! People bites are worse than monkey bites, and monkey bites are worse than dog bites.\" I said, \"Well, you don't have to go to the hospital right now. You have 48 hours before tetanus sets in.\" She was worried it wouldn't heal. She went inside where the doctor was and went under the deck. She said, \"The doctor said to analyze and see if you're the one who bit me in the arm. To see if they're your teeth bite marks. So pull your teeth out and put them in my hand so we can see if you're the one who bit me.\" I said, \"I told you I WAS the one who bit you, and I'm sorry but you wouldn't leave me alone. It's just what I had to do.\" I was waiting in line to go to the bathroom and a little boy came and he tapped me on the arm. He said , \"I have something from the lady for you. I'm gonna put it in your raincoat pocket. Now don't look.\" It was wrapped up in a napkin. I was at the NBA basketball championship. I didn't want to be doing what I was doing but I had to. There were about 18 chicks; girls like me, and we had to wear these cheerleader uniforms. Blue shorts with stars and red and white tops. We had to do this choreographed dance and be all SMILEY SMILEY and sing the Star Spangled Banner. It was just crazy. You had to be all smiley smiley and it ended with a split and I hadn't done that in a long time, And I thought, \"WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT?\" It made me so mad I just got up and went to stand in the bleachers. When I'd rather be singing: (When I wanted to be going) \"and the rockets red glare (da da da dow)\" [sound effects like machine gun] \"the bombs bursting in air (eeaaaahhhh BOOM)\" [sound effect of bomb dropping] \"gave proof through the night (da da da dow, pow pow pow)\" [sound of machine gun followed by pistol] \"that our flag was still there (da da da dow, pow pow pow pow pow, eeaaahhhh BOOM\" [machine gun, pistol, bomb] \"Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave, for the land of the free, (eeaaaahhhh)\" [bomb] and the home of the brave.\""

I just decided to get the pine needles up with the vacuum cleaner since I was vacuuming anyway. The thing was that with all those needles were the actual pine branches with the lights still wrapped all around them. And I was vacuuming. When I was vacuuming, the vacuum cleaner sucked all the Christmas lights up in there. Oh Man. I was trying to act like nothing really happened.

MAKE SURE THAT ROCK IS ON THE LEVEL!\" They had a level with the little yellow bubble in it. But they were doing it the wrong direction anyway. But I didn't think bridges being level really mattered too much. Oh my god, it seems like it came along later. But.......ah.....there was a beach. Then it parted like the red sea. There was an exodus. And if you wanted to go swimming you'd just walk up there and then the waves would crash in from both directions. From the left and the right. Hello kitty. OK kitty. You're purring. That means you're happy. Then the water currents. They always came in from both sides. They would CRASH. They had so much strength for something as soft as water. There were all these water currents you could feel under the water. You could feel them at your feet and at your knees and then a different direction at your stomach, and a different direction at your chest...and you were lucky if your head was still sticking up above water and you could breathe. The water had you moving all different directions and unless you were a snake, there's no way you could keep up with it. It was in art school. A guy lived in the same apartment building. He said Evelyn had been there. But she was off shooting a film. And I was in art school. The guy who lived next door was sitting out in front of the parking garage. He was getting a car out from the parking garage. I said, \"I didn't know you had a car.\" He said, \"Cars are underrated.\" I said, \"I guess, but that's because I'm a bad driver.\" And then he...... I said, \"What do you need a car for anyway?\" He said, \"To take a shower.\" Then I knew what he meant. He meant that his apartment didn't have a kitchen or a shower. He said, \"I'm gonna go out running for an hour. But I'll leave the door unlocked (the car door) so if you need to take a shower you can get into my place. He wanted to go to the shower house at the beach. The brick one with a shower on the outside and on the inside. I said, \"There's a real nice restroom at Siesta Key. You could just go to the deli, but it's a really nice restroom. He said, \"Well, I'll think about it.\" Then um......then there was a cheat sheet. There was a test in psychology/sociology. Usually she gave multiple choice, but this one was hard. I made this cheat sheet. I rolled it up and stuck it inside my sleeve. I was waiting for a chance to go to the auditorium and sit on the floor and take the test. I was waiting for a chance to pull it out, but it would make too much noise going, \"rattle, rattle\" so I ended up just running and playing, and I failed the test. I'm sure. It was about stupid things. The year certain things were invented. The year blah blah blah. There was this lady who was related to the boy who went to take the shower. She had this little bitty baby. It was one year old. It was a little baby. It didn't look 3 weeks old. It was happy. It didn't care what anybody thought. It was eating sliced olives.

We passed peach trees so I assumed we were in South Carolina. I could tell they were peach trees because of the shape of the leaves. We passed over an orchard of unidentified fruit trees. The fruit was round like grapefruit but white like it had been under a rock. The sphere fruit was hanging. There was a loose prescription bottle with loose Prozac in there and 2 Clonodine. The Clonodine were pink and white capsules which were suppose to appease withdrawal and induce sleep by lowering the blood pressure.

She was being crucified on a big pointed (whittled) stick and a big star was drawn on the reverse 18 X 24 photo and twisted her head in the middle [of the star]. When it was time to go, Marianna found me and said, \"It's time to go.\" We had to film a special about church. Marianna asked me did I want to take on the semi-religious folks or the real holy rollers. I said, \"I'm not scared of the holy rollers and I might be disowned from my family for what I'll say but it's what I think.\" They made us go through a metal detector at the church steps because we were not dressed appropriately--me and Marianna. I was wearing blue flip flops and Marianna's hair was not combed. Once inside they gave me a black pair of high heel shoes but I wanted to wear my flip flops so I put them on, on top of my flip flops. We were sitting on the heavy old 1920's movie seats and regular church people were sitting in Lazy-Boys. A lady producer came and got Marianna and when Marianna walked back up the church aisle her eyes were wide open and lots of make up and her hair was perfectly in place and combed. Then she pulled the mask off. The wig was attached to the top of the mask. The church ladies had made a super thin latex mask of Marianna's face with lots of alert make up and attached perfect and straight hair that was more yellow than Marianna's. Because Marianna hadn't combed( and wouldn't comb) her hair, the wig was attached (to the mask). Marianna pulled off the mask walking up the church aisle and said, \"I'm gonna keep this for when I'm too busy to comb my hair for the gallery. I was afraid she'd get in trouble for going against the church. On the desk I was writing, writing notes for my arguments against religion. It concerned Hindus and Buddhists, and the fact that they could be just as right as Baptists. It was a matter of perspective. I was getting bored in church so I dragged a piano between the rows. Then I had to drag the iron chair and it make a loud screeching noise. A lady brought a stack of hymns and choir songs for me to play. I didn't say anything because I had no intention of playing them. The sheet music on top said, \"When Jesus Calls\" in swirly writing. It was a threat. A little boy came and started playing at the piano for the first time in his life. I watched him. I wanted the church people to leave him alone. The preacher man told me he'd tried to call me and got a message about \"all-star free-lance terrorists.\" I started laughing because it was the Simpsons and I had come very close to taping Reverend Lovejoy's sermon, but I knew my mother would call and get offended. On the Sunday Morning Bible News, the interviewer asked me religious questions about my dreams with Dora but I would not answer. It was sacred and between me and Dora. I went grocery shopping with Evelyn. In the vegetable section was a plastic bin with loose Cornflakes, artichokes on a stick in front, and dried bell peppers in back. (red ones, green ones, and yellow ones). Evelyn said (that) it was either wood chips or Cornflakes and they needed to get themselves organized. She was trying unsuccessfully to put handfuls of Cornflakes in a plastic bag. I knew I was suppose to get a bell pepper and when I broke it off and pulled it, a Mexican man's head was underneath the bell pepper smiling. (the pepper was regular size and the man's head was the same size as a bell pepper. The pepper had grown over the man's head.) \"It'll grow back,\" he said."

The suckhole at the bottom of the lake was run by a vacuum system with a big heavy window frame. The cord got wrapped around the fan blades. I was trying to get it untangled so the filter system would work in our new 'swimming pool' because I knew we needed a drain and filter for healthy swimming. The water came up to my neck and finally I had to wait for the detective to help me get the filter system going. My aunt Dianne was dying and Elizabeth was alive and she was saying (that) the ladies had forgiven Dianne for sleeping with their husbands because she was on her deathbed. Their forgiveness made her calm enough to get very nervous about the fan blades. The lady then gave a test and rated you on readiness and though I could play the Mozart piece I could not keep the broken crayons off the floor around my desk. Papers were wadded up and sticking out of my desk and the floor around my desk needed sweeping bad. Finally a lady tested us on order, neatness and handwriting and then she told me to just go listen to music and draw. The desks were in a circle. I had long hair and I had gotten 3 wads of bubble gum stuck in my hair; separate wads, in the back, underneath, where it's all thick, and I had to cut it out with scissors, finally, because it was too matted up to do anything else."

They were sitting on rocks at the river--which were covered with 3\" of water from the river. It was surprisingly clear for a muddy river. I knew I had to leave and to come back. I had to walk in the shady woods with Dora and we passed a contraption, number 5, on the obstacle course. It was circular cross-country skiing. Dora was playing on it but something stopped her. It was a(n) arrogant fat man in a white shirt and said, \"Can I take this apartment and take it down to the lake and bring it back.\" And Dora said, \"Yes,\" so relaxed and calmly. I said, \"But....\" I was going to say, 'but it was my turn next.' But I knew I needed to swim at sunset. Swim hard back and forth across the lake to exhaust myself for all the aggression inside. I needed time alone from the relatives. Grandma and Grandpa and Aunt Bobbie and Uncle Bill had huge enlarged distorted eyes. I thought it meant they were going to die but I found out it was a botched obsolete eye operation they had had several years ago. There was a list of 5 phone numbers on a piece of paper. One number was 718-480-1188. One number was for Evelyn. One was for DORA. The circle of children from the family was sitting in the grass waiting to play. There were 7 heads of brown haired kids. I kept looking frantically for a blond-headed little girl. But Dora was not there. I was looking for her. The sun shined on my shoulders and I knew it was time for me to swim back and forth across the lake alone without talking to anybody."

My neighbor Maz was making room in his apartment and organizing and he had a friend who stared and never said anything. I started cleaning too and was very proud I'd filled a garbage bag with old newspapers. I knew the linoleum was very used because it was covered with very UGLY wall to wall carpeting. I decided to put a small old drawing table in there to cover the carpet. A man was interviewing me inside the apartment and asking me about the problems of dogs, people and cats shedding hair in apartments. I told him I was no expert on cleaning, but I used to clean this fancy loft for Bryan Hunt. Bryan came out and did NOT say \"Hi\" but started highlighting a pretty young girls hair. He had her chin on the table and her big blue eyes were staring open. It was very cold and I went to the Spanish bodega to get some saltine crackers and stuff to make oyster stew. There were no oysters and so I was gonna get just milk and butter and cook that, but it had disappeared from the shelves. Only odd Campbells  soup was there. Clear watery soup with 3 or 4 thin, thin brown twisted noodles and a few black beans floating amongst them."

Take care, Armando. -- Love, Merri [Armando Perez, co-founder of Charas El Bohio (a community center on the Lower East Side), was murdered April 4, 1999] There was a protest and we went there in roller coaster carts on the rail. There were lots of us. It was for Charas. There were also many prisoners, demonstrating hand to hand combat, to show the crowd of investors what we were capable of. We each collected things to throw off the roller coaster and break. I took a white plaster statue to throw and break. We had to climb under the barbed wire and throw the objects to break out before we climbed under, being careful not to break them then, to save them to break later for the protest. Circus performers were there and they jumped from the press box onto a set of coiled box springs. I was all set to jump. I wanted to so very bad, and then this grown up lady told me I couldn't. I told her I WAS NOT scared of getting hurt. That I would be having fun, even if I did get hurt, and that I had just as much right to jump as the clowns (did). (These clowns were poverty-stricken and wearing very ragged clothes, and for that reason, I admired them more.) One was on stilts and he jumped onto the coiled spring mattress and another one did flips after jumping onto the springs, and another one did back flips, and another one jumped onto his knees. Team studio 305 was following the 4 white girls to Sunday School, when William came along and told us we could follow him on the highest altitude land pass trail to the lowest altitude destination. First I was scared until he told us the secret... The secret: that the ridge along the top of the mountain would eventually lead to a path, that lead beneath the waterfall. In the hollowed out space underneath the cliff between the 500 ft. waterfall and the huge rock mass it fell from at a higher altitude. He was so happy because he was surprising us with a cookout. A picnic under the waterfall and he even carried the charcoal and the grill down the long winding mountain trail, even though it was a lot of extra trouble."

It said, \"Rudy's first grade project.\" It had a little hat and a space (for where his head would have been) and a shirt overlapped by a sweater and little pants and socks and shoes. Rudy unhooked the hanger and took the hat off. Then you could see his head when he was 6. There was a big gash and hair had just barely grown back from where they had to shave it at the emergency room. It hurt me so much to see what Rudy had been through. The hair on his forehead and sides was regular. Just the oblong tip top of his head had been shaved. [Me and Rudy] were on David Letterman together.

Then I would scrape around it and save the wax shavings. This scraping was on the state teacher's exam. Then the pennies grew into copper cookie cutters about the very same size as a penny. This time I scraped even better because I had practice, the first time. Rudy was very happy about the green wax. That I had gotten it ALL OFF. Then we watched a little girl and a little boy. He was oblivious, playing. She had 2 braids and blonde hair. She stared at him a long time. Then she bolted up to him, grabbed his shoulders and kissed him. Then he chased her into the tall grass, taller than them. I couldn't see them but I heard him say, \"Now I'm suppose to put my hand down your pants.\" Back at class the puppies were playing on the teacher's desk. It was Mr. Holland. One peed in his water bowl and I washed it out with hot water from a deli coffee pot. Then it was time to go. Class would resume in 1.5 hours and it had taken over an hour to get there. The girl was playing the bass [that] I wanted to play. It was an unusual bass and most of the string part was covered up except a little cutaway for your fingers. On the way home I walked past a roadside produce stand. I ate a strawberry and got one head of lettuce. When I got to the Rocky River bridge at Mitchell Presley's (Ekom Beach) the bridge was washed out because of the flood, so I had to walk another way. I was walking down the old Chestnut St., an abandoned road a long, long time overgrown with kudzu. Near the railroad tracks was a[n] old junk car that had not worked in a long, long time. Lying across the back seat was a black-haired man nodding out. The officer said, \"He's O.D.'d.\" He was gasping for air. He was dying. The officer said, \"Do you want to see him die? And I ran and screamed, \"NO.\" I'd seen too many people die already. His little boy was left playing near the railroad tracks. He had a huge turban on his head, sort of 3-sided with his hair sticking out. His eyes were black. He'd been through this before and he was not alarmed."

I acted like I didn't see the cops and they evaporated into thin air. A man and his son were hitchhiking down the Old Bradenton Road and I hitched a ride with them. We ended up doing spiral loops under the Manhattan Bridge and the waves were breaking on rocks. I had a wire 13-gallon trash can helmet on my head and I took it off.

There were many dishes to wash from Christmas dinner. I just turned the water on and watched it splash them. I did not scrub or use any soap to wash them. The lady had left for me: mostly pairs of cheap metal sunglasses--all broke in half right across the nosepiece. She had a drawer full of those things. She was extremely organized. 5 partitions inside the drawer ???. She had asked me to keep the fire going for her so the place would be warm when she got back. Even the kindling and middle size sticks were organized and knots in the branches downhill slanted and turned to the left. I put a knotty twisted branch in the fireplace to keep up the fire. People started knowing my name and I ran through the dark back halls of the church basement, running from them. They were at my heels but I lost them around corners. I stood there still and faded into the background like a lizard. I ran up the cement floor basement stairs, in that still and faded dark mess, 'off limits' except for the janitor. I barely got away. William could not get a wire attached in the engine of his car so the radio would not play. So he rode his bicycle. He met us there. I was astounded he got there before us.

An upright in the small room for practice and a concert grand Steinway in the big auditorium. The auditorium had 5 long rows of fold up metal chairs. People started filing in. In each seat were pages of text typed on white paper. I did not know what was on the paper, but I did know these people had come for some kind of convention. I warmed up a little bit in the practice room, but not enough. A lady at the secretary desk confided in me. She had just hung up the phone. She said, \"That was somebody donating a piano. Unfortunately, it's just an upright and those things are practically worthless. Anything but a grand just gets in the way, but I hated to sound snotty and inappreciative, so I accepted it.\" I was so envious. I wished somebody would donate a piano to me, but I knew I was not a non-profit organization, so my chances were slim at best. I went in to play for the convention. They were suppose to be impressed that I had been out on the streets and was now playing classical piano, but they just yawned. I stood in front and said, \"Hi.\" I had my music scattered all over the piano. Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven, Debussy and Bach. Two pieces by Bach. Goldberg Variations #1 and #8. I was missing part of Beethoven. I had 2 copies of The Girl with the Flaxen Hair. (La Fille aux Cheveaux de Lin) and Mozart Sonata in C. I wished I had learned page 7. It was beautiful. I had music to [Chopin's Prelude] Opus 28 #7, which I did not know. I had 2 copies of the Debussy. I could not find the rest of the Beethoven. The music was scattered all over the place and I got the pages mixed of music. I couldn't find anything. I started on back. I was getting nervous with the dead silence broken by an occasional person clearing their throat. When I lifted my hands to play they got tangled up in the electric cord (white) attached to the lamp on the left end of the piano. It had no shade. It crashed to the floor and broke. I said, \"Oops,\" and kept looking for the right music. After the uncomfortable ordeal I realized my main problem was not organizing the pages and getting the composers together. William came in and said he'd like some authentic Chinese food. He said I could order it take-out or get a cookbook from the library and make it myself. Since we were in the neighborhood, I got a cookbook from the local branch library. But the recipes did NOT seem authentic. There was green apple pie (sour) and (sweet) \"vanivalar\" ((vanilla)) ice cream sweet. There were pork roll sandwiches with lettuce on them, in 3-D shapes of pigs."

Scott was sitting on the wooden couch looking at pictures of castles. He called them rooks. I called them castles. He was trying to think of the place this castle was.

I said, \"You should put as much effort into your acting and forget about the head shots for now.\" She was simpering. I said, \"you should quit whining.\" She was looking at a book of photographers and bragging about her Mother. She flipped the pages of the catalog and kept complaining and I said, \"WOULD YOU SHUT UP!\" I looked behind me and Mary Reynaldie was taking it all in with amusement. Her eyes were thinking. My father was making home made peach ice cream and you could tell when it was ready because it started coming out of the top. I was in charge of scooping it into 12 Dixie Cups. my father liked vanilla wafers with his. Soggy in ice cream. I was running a race and I forgot about the finish line. A little girl was balancing her bicycle on the curb, trying to get to the very top of the hill. [I assumed the finish line was at the top of the hill, but I was wrong] Exterminator inspectors came into the apartment. I said, \"I'm busy now.\" He said, \"You'll be busy later too.\" So I kept doing what I had to do of everything around Zeb's bags and my books and the clutter. I didn't have time to be concerned about my mess. I followed him through the door. He had a vacuum cleaner. I thought, \"He sure cleaned up my kitchen fast.\" There were 2 brand new duck head phones and a fax machine on the kitchen table. I loved the new phones he put in. It was sparkly clean. He said, \"This is NOT your kitchen, it's your neighbors.' \" I knew he was right. WE went back to my messy place. 3 messages. I hit \"play.\" I had left a message on the answering machine telling Dora how much I loved her and missed her. I could not remember where I called from."

One guy and woman got in a fist fight in the corner and I tried to lure them out of the fight with snowballs, but I had no flavor juice. Just the snowball ice. Rudy said, \"Merri, you need some Kool-Aid,\" but he had to catch a helicopter. The address he gave was the church's medieval garden. I said, \"Rudy, is there enough room?\" And he said, \"...if there is on 34th Street. I'm just a little worried about the Math.\" Mr. Patterson kept saying, \"If you get out of town tell the president our town sewer needs 53 turns to the right. The sewer is between the church and the bank. I said, \"OK,\" but I had no intentions of concerning myself with the town sewer. Not after how Mr. Patterson had carried on. My mother had built a strange musical instrument the whole width of the Bobo Chapel, but the strings were so loose they laid around on the instrument. When you plunked them nothing happened."

An old man was suppose to have saved my black old shoes, men's, but he had lost them instead of putting them in a cardboard box. Finally the boat left but we were running 4 hours behind schedule and had to bail out the water that was filling up in the boat. Finally, finally we got to fish and the salty old bearded man was grumpy. Me and Dora got our fishing lines all tangled up and he made us stand in line twice. Once to get untangled and once for bait. 2 hooks were on a line and a safety pin hook at the bottom, because some fish preferred to big safety pins. Squid was bait, but sliced up small. There wasn't much bait in the bucket. When we ran out of bait, me and Dora had to get into somebody's lunch to find something we could use for bait. It was all wrapped up, the tuna fish sandwich with lettuce on a roll, in white paper and a very small paper bag. They'd eaten the first half. It was sliced in half. I tore the bag in excitement and we scooped out tuna fish from the center with our index fingers and baited the bottom hook with tuna, the top hook with lettuce. I caught an inflatable black toy pig about 9\" in length. It had alphabet letters, random, on it. Mary Susan Smith, a sissy girl, caught a swordfish."

Just before the final blow, I said, \"I'm sorry,\" and watched his last breaths. It was gut-wrenching sad. But it had to be done. Blood was all over the beige carpet and folded-up clothes that were stacked on the floor. The couple married one year came strolling through the sliding glass door. I yelled at them, \"You could have been shot! Police would call it self defense because somebody could say they thought you were breaking in. Would you help me clean up this blood?\" But all they'd do was put a donation in the plate. She put in $1.00. He put in a five. She said, \"You sure are messy.\" I said, \"Well, we were doing laundry. What do you expect?\" I had to go to the convenience store for the Sunday paper. The paper was empty.

Dora said, \"Merri, do you know how?\" I said, \"Well, not exactly, but I'll figure it out.\" She said, \"Merri, don't, you'll get in trouble.\" But by this time I had pulled up the tulips and daffodils out of the ground. They had not bloomed yet. They never would now. The bulbs and green stems were laying in the dirt and only wild onions were left growing alive."

I wasn't paying attention and didn't see the red blinking light. I couldn't remember if the guy said for me to push the levers down or up, so I pulled up and the jet's tail was scraping along the highway and making sparks fly. I said, \"DOWN.\" The guy had to siphon oil from his car to put in the jet and he kept shaking his head in disbelief. The lady at the film and TV party made a joke about 10 hits of codeine. I had boxes to mail and clothes were everywhere. I had fun at the girls' and loved them and tried on some crazy outfits and even some lingerie, but I had to get going to mail my boxes and draw the Brooklyn Bridge in black, blue and red on a NY Times full page double spread ad that had lots of white space. I filled it up beautiful. The Brooklyn Bridge drawing was finished in the paper. It advertised nothing. Because I didn't get the jet in the right place, the store rent and was closed and the jet pilot fixed spaghetti, tomato sauce and raw fillet slabs of sword fish and it was TERRIBLE. So I went to changed my clothes and fell down the hill--but I only told him and my mother I was going to change clothes because I knew they'd say NO if I told them I was going to roll down the hill. The hill was huge, with grass, real green and scattered yellow, \"daisy-type\" flowers."

He had time to kill until 9:30 p.m. when he had to leave to got to Queens for the score. He said, \"Do you want to come look at my drawings?\" I said, \"NO I DON'T want to come look at drawings you did in 1987.

I had actually only seen them once but it seemed like a million times. He got so upset (that) he couldn't get the pill bottle open that was sitting on the table. He finally got it open and swiped out a handful but spilled them; his hands were shaky. He tried to break a xanax  in half like he was cutting back and swiped up a handful--quick-like, like in playing jacks. He put them in his pocket and left. This made me fed up with New York and I went to Florida back to my old art school to paint undisturbed for a while. Before I left I saw them throwing out some beautiful, very stylish, black standing lamps and I wanted to take one. There were 5. But it was 6 feet tall and a lot to carry to Florida without a car. When I got there it was night and I was appalled at the long distances between ATMs, when you didn't have a car. Kids at the steps near the ocean, hanging out talking to me. I resolved not to suck up to their brown nosing, even though I was lonely not knowing anyone. I went to a bar where they also fixed bicycles and in came girls who'd found 5 bicycles. Those deco lamps had folded out into bicycles. I was mad at myself for not getting one when I saw them tossed out. They were all identical--flat black Schwinns, sleek girls' model bikes. The girls were sewing square multi-colored scarves onto army backpacks. I left the bar and it was raining and I climbed in somebody's window, but walking across the floor the booby trap got me. It had rubber hoses and suction cups that would grab me and was like a rubber blanket of leeches. I finally got out and the art student recognized me. \"Aren't you the one who broke into my house?\" I said, \"I'll return your tape.\" At least his place smelled like turpentine. I went into an all-night Chinese restaurant (looking for cigarettes) and to get a cup of coffee to go. She rang it up--$1.50. I said, \"$1.50 for a plain old cup of coffee? You can just throw it away. I won't pay $1.50 for a fifty-cent cup of coffee.\" I felt like I had done the right thing."

I said, \"How do you make these calves stop jumping?\" Because they were making it hard for me to walk. They were jumping up real high. Their little hooves were about 4 feet from the ground. There were lots of them too. Hank was walking out there in the pasture too but I was walking by myself. He was being very nice to me and I was chewing bobble gum. Lots of it. When we got back from the pasture, Rudy said, \"Merri, you've got bubble gum all over your face.\" I had been blowing bubbles and popping them so I could hear the sound and I didn't even notice. I went to look in the mirror and sure enough, bubble gum was stuck all around my mouth--it covered my lips and went up to my nose in some places. I couldn't get it all off.

But the shape and the icing leaking through the paper--you could tell it was cupcakes. 2 were not wrapped but they were specially decorated for Christmas. One had a Hershey's kiss on top. The other had a big horsey cheap, blue Christmas light stuck in the icing. By this time the broken muffin had multiplied into many more muffins--of different kinds (but none the same kind as the first one that fell). There were 5 new muffins that came from the original muffin. Blueberry, purple, cranberry and 2 more I didn't know what kind. At a parade we were weaving a hug American flag--a choreographed weaving of hundreds of people carrying 12\" wide rolls of cloth--red, white, blue. Each strip of cloth was about 100 feet long. Nobody bumped into each other. 2 boys or else very short men were tap dancing out in front. My mother wanted to watch the tap dancers. A fancy lady in a self-important hurry asked me where she could go for lunch. I told her, \"Go to the penthouse at the Hilton,\" because I knew she didn't want to eat any cupcakes. A girl was soaking wet and running around screaming where was her walkman somebody stole it. Bonnie came with a radio and threw it down on the concrete and smashed it and then ran real fast and flung herself bare-legged down on the concrete, sliding head-first and scraped her knees up something terrible."

It just didn't concern me enough to bother with what they thought. It was not important enough. I was doing my laundry in a basement and the ??? It had been in his family for years. A watercolor I had done was on the floor. It was a study of the door to the others and how colors change the light that is on both sides. The door was cracked open but not very much. Not enough to walk through. Three colors they had out there they had over there do not exist here, so I had to use yellow and purple and green. It was a mess of a quick study to capture a thought for me--worthless to anybody else. But the big do-gooder president of the \"help-the-crazies house\" thought it was making good use of the crafts program. He couldn't have understood what I meant and would have just thought I was more crazy and I didn't care a flip about what he thought of me, so I didn't say anything. I got my laundry out of the dryer and tried to fold my sheet. I cannot fold it good. It was light blue and flannel and it was wadded up like a lump of scrambled eggs from McDonalds. I met a little girl and a teenage boy who was beautiful, but not pretty, and he couldn't have been a boy or a girl. I said, \"Are you a boy or a girl?\" And he said, \"I let the boy decide that.\" There were 7 little newborn puppies and kittens laying on their stomachs watching TV with their eyes closed. I tried to make sure they all had room because they couldn't walk yet. I made sure they were warm. One was a tiger kitten. His name was Tiny Boy 2. He was beautiful but his head was like a grown-up tiger and could look mean. He was about 6 inches long. The girls were in combat uniform and had devices to change their voice when they spoke and some had masks on their heads, but I could tell by their hands who was who. There were hand signals to go with the words--some words were from street gangs, some from Castro's speeches and some from Martin Luther King. Evelyn was in this group, but she had been taken to jail for race mixing. I was in colored town, helping a black lady whose baby was sick. I was cleaning and doing laundry for her. We were walking down the road where Vera used to live. It wasn't paved cause it was colored town and the city didn't bother to pave those roads. Colored people didn't much have cars. They walked mostly. When we were way past the houses a black and white cop car passed us. The lady said, \"You go ahead. I ain't gonna cause you no more trouble.\" I walked ahead, not sure if the cops had spotted me. They turned around and came back to get me. They said it was worse because I was working FOR a nigger. They took me to jail and told me to go to cell-block 5A. When the cop un-cuffed me my elbow bumped into his arms and they all screamed at me. I wondered which cell Evelyn had been in. The cells were glass booths. They took my clothes and gave me a sheet. One cell was a glassed in bathtub and the other was smaller--a shower stall. I took the bathtub so I could lay down if I could sleep, even though I was scared to sleep because I could see in their eyes. Rape was in the cards. There was no window. Since it was glassed in there was no air and when I used up the air I saw a tiny window that could only be opened if a bar was undone and water was turned on full force. The window was high and to prolong your life for air, only meant you were gonna drown later when the glassed in cell filled up, which it was doing. Then, just in time, an inmate came and unlocked my cell. Men prisoners were allowed to roam free. He had on a dirty white t-shirt with black writing and stringy red hair. The other prisoners hated him because he was a rat. He fought with me and got me down on the ground. He was on top of me and I could feel his stringy hair on my face. The prisoners and cops didn't help me. My kitty came to my bed to wake me and I hit her--thinking she was the rapist."

They gave you your cash at the end of your shift and I was gonna come back tomorrow. The sign on the blackboard said $8.50/hr. broke down to $5.60/hr after taxes.

I met them outside at a restaurant. Justin was going to get married---they had rented the restaurant to have a private wedding. I made a comment about the fancy-fake restaurant--a smart-ass comment and I offended everybody there. The only thing I could do was leave. On the way out, Jasmine was coming in. She wanted to paint and my paints were on the floor. I was learning to use meringue as a medium. Not from the pie, but from my mother's mixing bowl before she got the pie finished.

She talked on the phone to a guy she liked. He was a male prostitute. I did not find him appealing in any way. The building floor on 22 St.--something fishy was going on there with girls who rented rooms in this place. They rented some full-time, but you could tell what they were doing. Something fishy was going on--you could tell by the sounds ??? but then intense frantic conversation. Liz knew who rented rooms in this place. She rented it for 12 hours. Liz got half the day and the male prostitute took the other half. The male prostitute rented it for secret activity (that) only the girls of the house knew about. They made little inside jokes and that was sad. Because they thought it was cute. She came back and now she's fucked up big time on drugs. We needed to gather postage stamps. Blocks of 5x5 stamps but somehow the total was always 10, not 25. Some stamps were unusable because the circle perforations had been popped open and exploded like bubble wrap. Stamps were all over the floor ??? and under them was a coke vial and Liz sniffed the last coke and threw the vial out the car window. I was trying to go to sleep. I wanted to take a nap. I'd just got off my shoes when a knock came at the door. He said, \"Your 12 hours is up. Where's the guy? Finish up and get out.\" I said, \"WHAT!\" And he said the maids were coming to put clean sheets on the bed and then I understood. I wanted to tell the girls, but I knew they would not listen anyway so I started gathering up my stuff to get away from this dangerous place. My bags, now more and too heavy, so many, so many shoes and my roller skates and something a guy said made a piece of paper wrinkle in slow motion. Smooth wrinkle. The (male prostitute) guy left something on the shelf. He was looking for it. I said, \"Next to the TV.\" He was finished the 12-hour shift and the girls were relieved but soon it would show up.

It felt good and he rolled over and we were front to front and he got up to take his shirt off and just that second the teacher walked in. Nobody had done the assignment, because we didn't understand what to do. The teacher left and we were suppose to continue but things fizzled out. Me and Nick and Rudy walked to a mall. It was partly closed and partly opened. We stood in front of the automatic doors and watched them open and close. We walked through the closed part to the open part. Nick had to go to work at his job. He was a security guard. He worked nights. I went back to class and spilled a couple of tiny drops of soup onto somebody's paper. They had written with black ink on pale blue paint. It all blurred and ran into each other. 4 lines of text in all--2 above, 2 below. It all blurred and blurred till there was nothing left and it was my fault. Then the teacher and Jasmine came in to do a reading. None of us were expecting this. Nobody was ready. A fat country boy read an eloquent piece about growing up in Madden's Station. I yelled in excitement, \"That's where we kept the horses!\" It was inappropriate that I yelled but I kept pointing out Madden's Station to everybody around me. Jasmine came in for the reading in a floor-length black dress, lace. She was dressed to listen. I was trying on pretty bras. A black lace one and a white lace one. I did not want to cover them up with a shirt so I walked around in the black bra and forgot I wasn't wearing a shirt until the big teacher came in and then I remembered (that) I had been fooling around with Nick and she would think it was more than it was and kick us out so I put on a white t-shirt.

I set out to make some ice. I filled an ice tray and put it in the freezer. I left the freezer door open but the ice made so quick I could not believe it. I took out the ice and set out to make some more. If I closed the freezer and refrigerator door it would make real fast, I bet, but I had to leave. The folks coming back might shoot me if they came back on Sunday afternoon and a stranger was making ice in the refrigerator. I was in a chicken restaurant that was expanding.

The teacher told the kids to unbutton and unzip their pants and drop them while standing in line so they would get done sooner.

We both had books to read and she was dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and I was dressed like Fidel Castro in shorts. We practiced and it was funny but when we went on stage we were 45 minutes late. People were already yawning bored. We failed miserable. I forgot my book to read irrelevant passages from and I had to go back to the locker and get it. Vicki forgot her book. I could not wait for it to be over. Neither could the audience. We were going to take photographs with Jay Mills. He was meeting us at the gallery. He usually rode his bicycle in from Connecticut. He had a favorite hat. It was a McDonalds hard hat. It was obviously a rare out-of-city hat and it had been stolen. William said Mills should wear a NYC McDonalds hat in the city because then nobody would want it. We were getting ready to go and Jay Mills said, \"Merri, you need to get your camera and your lens and your film. They're all in different places inside the gallery.\" And it was like hunting for Easter eggs."

I propped her up on pillows and tried to make sure I put a log on to keep the fire going hot and not die down. I had to keep leaving and come back to check on her because there were things I needed to do. There was a drugstore in the airport and I was going to get some things to help Dora: some medicine, Vaseline, and on the way I had to walk through the high school commons and there were lots of tables filled up. I met a table of 3 misfits. A very intense quarterback football player who used to be a heavy drug addict and was not rehabilitated and bearing down hard writing on his papers--trying to straighten up and fly right. He was studying the 12-steps. He had 2 friends there. The one girl--she was very butch, husky, with a bad haircut like an adolescent boy would get in a hick town barber shop on the half-days when they were busy (Wednesday and Saturday). She was gathering information. His other friend was a morose black girl. She sat without talking at the table with her fingers laced, elbows wide and resting on the table. She was deep in thought. She never looked up to see anybody. She was the only one who saw the big picture. The tables were metal made to look like fake wood. They could fold up. William came to the school to teach a class and mostly guys were taking it. The rehabilitated football player and his 2 girl buddies were taking the class as one person. Other than me, the rest of the students were guys. The football guy and friends (3 counting himself) wanted to dress up as Bible characters. They were going around trying to find a wolf skin so he could be Abraham or Moses. ???The 2 friends were his lost sheep. I knew William already, so I could be me. I said, \"William, right now, I want to smash the table with a hammer, just to hear the noise.\" He said, \"OK.\" /??? Sitting on high stools. The guys were working hard. One guy was painting the table green and when he painted it, it became transparent and green. See-through metal green. I remembered Dora and I went to check on her. ??? tampon stuck and went to the doctor ??? about 3's and 7's. We were standing in line soaking wet. I was wearing long thin cotton pants for running and a thin long sleeve cotton shirt, soaking wet and I was cold. Then I ran to see Dora. By now I was dry from all the running and not so cold. At a church they were lining bags to take to shut-ins. A lady, she said it was donation bags I was going to take one. (they all had coffee, eggs and other stuff in them) but Dora persuaded me not to. She said it was not a sin to steal from the church, but it was a sin to take anything from the kind old people."

We had a conveyor belt darkroom set up but first I had been rubbing wet paper on a cocoa metal box to lift a transfer copy of the letters from. The transfer was lifted in tiny little couscous like beads. By the time I finished the first one it was midnight. The art stores were closed. A crazy (retarded) lady from the building had been ranting and raving in the middle of the street in the busy part of the city. The cops brought her--since the lady was going to sleep, unaware of the art supplies she wasn't using. I left a sandwich on the counter. Jasmine was helping the lady and Jasmine let me use her tissue paper, since when she woke up there would be more. This time I got more and the big letters lifted, though the small letters (ingredients) had been near perfect the first time. The gallery was being rented out for a wedding and the bride was a no-show. I was supposed to get married but my mind was on the art project in the darkroom. I was invisible to the wedding guests who were looking at their watches. They had forgotten to get drinks to go with the cake. So a takeout delivery was made: one pint of O.J., a 12 oz. can of apple juice and a couple other cans of juice. I put them in the refrigerator and left. The guests were at the table waiting for fireworks and instead all they got was mustard and ketchup. I was walking up 1st Avenue and stopped in front of a storefront. Inside there were 5 lace slips from another country, another century. They were marked $30.00. I didn't have the $. The poems were scattered on the floor of the empty bar and the guys were leaving to go check out all the topless bars. They asked me did I want to go, but I knew it was just out of politeness and instead I wanted to stand in front of the window of the closed shop and look at the beautiful slips on hangers. $30 apiece."

The basketball court was 2 doors down. At center court was an adolescent girl just developing. They had her on the news and the bleachers were full. Kids were making fun of her and she was upset because the extra weight of breasts interfered with her swimming time (added seconds, kept her from winning). They used a stick pointer and pointed to her breasts and leered at her, calling her the best swimmer in the world, but they didn't mean it at all. My mother said, \"Merri, go to the grocery store and get some bread,\" but there were 4 loaves already. So I told her that.

One team needed another player so I played. Then the game moved inside the gym. I came in and right away it was my turn to serve. I said the score, \"1--20.\" We were close to losing. The ball was too flat. It wasn't even a volleyball but that didn't matter as much as it needing air. The first time I went to serve I missed the ball altogether. Then I hit it over and it touched the net and went over. Like a let in tennis but I didn't know what they called it and their rules were confusing how it was OK in tennis but not OK in volleyball. We stopped playing and the other team, the good team who won, told us we could sit on the floor in the narrow part until the next game. They got to sit in the bleachers."

Their minds were the same but their faces were changed so they looked exactly like the other (Merri=Dora, Dora=Merri) when the little girls woke up they didn't know, except when people called them by the wrong name. Only when they looked in the mirror and saw the other sister did they know something was different. But in time we got used to seeing the other sister's face when we looked in the mirror. This was OK. Dora smiled back at me. But then the parents did another operation to put an old man's head on my body and when I looked in the mirror I was an old man. I had never seen a little girl with a gray stubble beard and stubby, prickly, gray, white, black sprinkles of stiff chopped hair on her head. She took the puppies out and let them run loose and play in the side yard. They were brother and sister puppies. I wasn't suppose to let them run loose but I did anyway. I was running under bridges instead of over them on the lower (upper) end of Manhattan."

There were firemen hoisting themselves uphill on a pulley. 4 firemen. One was a woman. They had a bucket of water each and one had a plant waterer. They were waiting for the 5th fireman, a woman who would not use the usual route. Just then a very fat black woman dressed in Sunday clothes cut loose in a wagon pulled by 4 black horses, sleek and strong. They would not go up the hill toward the firemen but down the hill and crazy curve to the right and stop. They did this twice from the same starting point--where the uphill horizontal pulley started. The 3rd time she had passengers riding--a rich preacher she'd met on a Caribbean cruise and someone else. The horse went crazy and kept going right toward the picnickers down where the hill leveled off. I watched to see them hop up out of the way. It was funny but they were scared and she was screaming apologies. Finally the crowd, some in bulldozers and high machinery, circled around the worn out horses closing them in with the angry crowd and closing off my view. I'd been sitting outside the doorway, trying to catch some sun between the shadows and a man kept offering to let me use the headphones from his car generator to save my batteries. I went in the car with him and others --he offered me tapes to listen to too but I told him I had my own. We were going fast around a curve when my door flew open. He was yelling, \"Shut the door!\" An 18-wheeler got close up on his tail--inches close--because he slowed down too much. It was crazy for him to worry. When we got there I had a waitress job at a dark coffee shop that looked like a bar. After not-too-long a fellow worker started talking cult-talk to me and I realized they were trying to get me. I had tables to wait. A guy had asked about bagels and I said, \"What's spread out all over the counter, that's what we've got,\" and offered him the tasting bagel to try. He said he'd have whole wheat toast, no butter just jelly, cut diagonally. I tried to cut it but the knife ripped it instead and there was nothing to do but toast the bread, torn into 3 pieces and explain. When it came time to get paid, the cult woman gave me $50 in Confederate money. I put up a fuss about it and said \"I need money.\" She said it was probably worth a lot more but I turned it over and the price tag on each bill said 40 cents. She was in charge of the weekly office cult. That was the name in big letters on their church. Weekly Office. I started screaming about their no-good lying cult and walked off with Theo who'd asked me about some towels sewn together. Evelyn came by and we went to a thrift store where 3 blue jean jackets hung on backs of chairs. One had names in ball point pen--boys names across the back. One had a black sharpie drawing of a boy in a hood with rhinestone studs at his elbows. One had pockets in a weird place. Evelyn found a bright aqua teal blue coat she liked. I had to lifeguard. Mary was covered up to her head in the sand and she got up effortlessly as the sand fell away. I got a phone call that Ed McMahon was casting a movie in my home town. I walked to the Long Island watershed district and looked over the high wooden fence that ended. A patrolman said he couldn't arrest me for looking at the fence, but if I touched it to try to get over he would arrest me right then. I touched it and found a foothold to start climbing when he left. The only path I had not tried was one that looked not like trying--that it lead us nowhere--a footpath. The others were car roads. There was long since trampled grass and a shell from boiled peanuts with one peanut left inside."

I sat in the boat and rocked it in the water. It felt good. I lost the boat and was pulling myself, arm over arm, by the rope back to the dam but then there was a current swinging me in a huge counter-clockwise circle. The current was stronger than me. Rudy and Lisa were relaxing near a pool. Rudy was in the pool and walking back to the Isle of Palms-ish hotel. I started, hesitated, then Lisa came out and waved. I had a playground (grocery store) ball. I kicked it and asked Rudy to go get it. He was in the water. He said, \"If you wanna be on the Oprah Winfrey show, you go get it.\" Oprah W. was doing a show about lovely city pools. We left the ball. Then Rudy went to practice swimming against the current in the lake. Troy and another guy were practicing too. I was picking up green beans from the dam and taking them to the front porch. When I went back 2 were all wet and flattened out. I asked the guy in the passenger side where my beans were and he said he'd been using them for band-aids on his ankles. Rudy and his swimming buddies were eating rice from stainless steel bowls. Eating from bowls the other one held. It made a little circle. One said, \"We don't like to look like we work for a living.\" On the ramp a futzy girl in a huff brushed me aside and I said I'm not taking the boat anyway and started dancing like a leprechaun, singing. She imitated me and I started singing the Violent Femmes. \"Just last night I had forgotten of just how sick I had gotten and just how sick I had become..........\" She didn't know this. A guy chimed in and she flirted with him and they went away together. 2 snakes were kissing in the shallow end and a baby snake bit my toe. Alan said, \"These 2 computers are bubbling--bubbling!

A clean-up crew came by with a clean-up poster offering to clean for $5. I thought there must be some mistake. That at least they left a \"1\" out. Then the family was off to 6-Flags to get the special deal before daylight. We rode the roller coaster backwards through water that was coming off the roofs. Then in the bathroom my mother said she saw a man's arm without the man in the front doorway. I got separated from everybody. They had cars. I had roller blades. I didn't know if they'd left buy it was 6:23 a.m. by now (it was 6:03 on the roller coaster) and now it was broad daylight. I skated down the interstate farther and farther. I passed exit ramps. Then I realized I was alone and that they were probably waiting at the gate till the park opened regular at 8 or 9 a.m. I knew that the further I went the further I'd have to go back. I kept going. I was later at a hotel room. Debbie was there. I had a small bed. She had a water bed. Little by little the room got messier and messier. Fruit rolled all over the floor. I found a xerox paper box. Inside under my bed, Debbie had put 2 open packages of sliced rye bread, the front pieces all clawed and mangled. Behind that was a bag of Thomases English Muffins, all soft and squishy. 4 of the 6 were there. I was watching a cartoon I'd never seen before and making the color and resolution change by hitting buttons on the remote."

There was an old house that was made into new apartments without doors. I was supposed to be moving there but I didn't understand where one apartment ended and another began. It was not a loft. Out front was a big old oak tree with low branches and a table had been built around the tree, in a big square, with room for people to sit in chairs between the tree and the table. Lots of apples were stacked up on the table in a pyramid. They were green apples and huge--about the size of soccer balls. Alicia was there with her girlfriend whose name was Rex. I kept walking in at the wrong time when they were getting all touchy feely private with each other. Rex told me, \"Why don't you just draw a rope and I'll hang myself.\" Guys at the table around the tree were laughing and talking. Seven African children were naked, playing in the mud. Covered in mud. This was in appreciation to their mother. They sat at the table all around her. I was looking for a box to prop my head up on. A wood block. On the sidewalk people were confused. A huge crowd dispersed. I didn't know if it had ever been there or not. I was up the street talking--listening to a lady whose mind was somewhere else."

And the lady who had owned him and killed him stood talking to him, trying to soothe him as he lay dying. I went to the other refrigerated room. I picked up a chicken. It was $3.03. Another one was $3.05. It was $1.79/lb. I was trying to find one for less than $2.00. I knew they did not want to cook anyway so I left without getting anything. Walking up Mott St. someone said, \"Miss, you dropped a bill.\" And it was money. I folded it up and put it in my pocket, only to find out later it was counterfeit. The edges turned pale blue and blue grew into nearly half the bill and the ink disappeared. I went into the grocery store and an alarm went off. Screens at every checkout read \"CODE 207M.\" Then a guy came to see why the alarms went off and he said, \"Oh, it's because you're really an A65.\" I was in the freight elevator with Bryan Hunt and he said, \"You fell asleep on the couch 4 years ago for 5 hours and when I woke up you were gone. The bed at the foot of the bed and you were gone.\" I said, \"I don't remember that.\" And he said, \"I'll ask you again tomorrow.\" And I said, \"I won't remember it then either.\" We were flying in an airplane over Columbia. Rudy spotted a beautiful house next to the zoo and the river and the highway. We parachuted out and across from the house we landed in a bunch of scrappy twisted up vines and late fall underbrush with clearing in between. I said, \"This is what I like.\" My father held up 5 strands of barbed wire fence, some new, some old and rusted, for us to roll under. I got barb wired stuck in my face and the doctors did not know anymore how to pull out barbed wire from the skin."

We were in a cavernous big auditorium, on the way to high school elections. There were 3 guys running. None of them were from our school. One of them was sitting on the floor voting for himself repeatedly. One was handing out bookmarks. One was drawing pictures of himself. People were forgetting to vote."

I kept grabbing handfuls and always there was more. I was moving from 2 places. Grandmas and the log cabin. I had cleaned out from under the bed and nailed up what was in a closet--a board over it so it looked like wall. I said to Rudy, \"Don't let me forget to take down that wall.\" Rudy went to take a shower and his hair was sparkly blonde like Marianna's. It was luxurious in the shampoo bubbles. My father brought a fellow over. I was wearing my overalls backwards because I put them on that way to see how it worked and then I didn't have time to change them. I was packing to move. The police were at the door. my father came and told me he brought this fella over and told him he could make a special milk shake drink. my father handed me the milk shake cup and ice cream. I had to stop cleaning. The police were knocking. My mother surprised us all by shouting from a hidden bathroom. She was taking a bath. We didn't know she was there. It was time for breakfast, she said. It was french toast. Stacks of it. Rudy put a piece (of French toast) in the sink and watched water run over it. My mother put 1-1/2 on my plate. Rudy got as many as he wanted. There were 30--40 pieces of french toast on a platter. One waffle square. And a 3rd tray of waffle-ish french toast. The man was still waiting for his ice cream. The police were still there. The ice cream man had a picture of a shadow of a wolf. He kept saying, \"You can see the wolf but you can't see his eyes.\" Rudy and me looked at the picture and it could just as easy be a bunny. my father said the man needed to hook up his computer to see his e-mail. There was an electrical outlet in the closet, but I tried to explain to my father it needed a phone line too. There was a tray of plants. A man was asking me for Valium. I told him I didn't take that stuff anymore. The plants were dancing. Flowering, budding and growing leaves in comparative unison. They could see. They were facing each other."

I was drawing my dreams, on the newspaper of the day I dreamed it, and they were making good sense. William was watching it all. Nick slept on a couch and set the alarm to go off every hour, but it would ring every 30 minutes. I'd write my dreams within the ramp, crossing the bridge, convinced. William opened doors. Fine artists began becoming more conceptual. Conceptual artists were starting to paint. William had gone around his hairline with a very, very thick magic marker, black, to get some painters thinking. But then they (the painters) shaved his head. It was all stubbly like a baby chicken's head. He went to talk to the lady in charge (about the program, not about his hair). A young woman, black, had asked him to help her understand her dreams. I left to go to the bathroom. My aunts had come to see what this gifted/talented program I was in, near their land, was. They were obnoxious and loud. In the bathroom I had (hid) my face behind a painting. Then I locked myself in the bathroom. They finally, FINALLY left and I looked out the screen and my mother spotted me and they all started back in. I said, \"Please, My mother, just DON'T.\" Inside, away from the family terrors, William was working with the girl. She was pacing. William told her dreams are only able to communicate through images and surface tension. She said she was gonna go think about that for a week. Dancers were balancing. (Touching the railing with only their toes, every other dancer in the line had both feet touching. In between those were dancers with only one foot touching. The were balancing in mid-air. Looking like elegant divers about to enter the water in a graceful back dive. The ones with one toe touching had the other foot bent at the knee, toes pointed, angled back toward the head. Girl dancers. The lady said we could keep the house free till after Christmas. 8 weeks. And she could get $150. per winter for each person. I still didn't know which category I belonged in, the thinkers or the painters. Mostly I'd been talking about my dreams and drawing pictures of them with a black magic marker on sheets of the day's newspaper, dreamed then, The NY Times. Little kitty was with me there--finding secret trap doors behind walls that only kitties could fit. I could keep her there too. Zeb was there.

They pulled and pushed, but he pool was too shallow but it was all they could do. Then a bigger monster escaped and came toward the baseball field. They thought it came to see how the game was going.

We fooled around a little and stopped and turned the light on and he said, \"You started it. You aren't gonna be afraid to be in a room alone with me now, are you?\" and I said no. It was late afternoon but warm and I wanted to go to the beach. my father was gonna drive real fast to get there while I could still get some sun. Dora didn't want to go but I wanted her to go. I took a sweatshirt and a towel 'cause I knew it'd be cold afterward. Marianna had gone back to do her old job for an assignment. She was CEO of a murder investigation of an all white mafia motorcycle gang that went from NY to Hartford, Conn. The 3 suspects were scattered out and William and Mary were helping catch the bad guys. (murderers)"

When I got back it had gotten cold. We poured it from the pan. It was half cooked. I tried to eat a bite but it wouldn't even twirl on the fork. It was stiff and stuck together--gummy on the outside, hard on the inside. The girl said it was just right for her but I said, \"I'm gonna have to cook this some more. I hope you don't mind.\" Then we were going to Arizona with some homeless people--her and the teacher. I was unpacking socks from shoe boxes I'd wrapped in gray socks and throwing out the boxes.

They piped in Aerosmith and Ozzy Osborne and Black Sabbath, AC/DC. We were dancing in the balcony aisles, me and Dora. I was freer in my dance and was finding strange rhythms within the music, using my hands like rudders to a sailboat. I had taken a shower in the kitchen and the living room carpet got all wet underneath. It was someone else's turn to take a shower when the Charleston Philharmonic came to the backwoods. I went to the basement to use a computer. Alan was there. He straightened out many tangled wires that were my thoughts. He was working on a project. Trying to update a system that was archaic. He came in and announced to the staff that he had something for them. He waited till all 4 staff members came to sit around the table (after they turned their TV game show off) and dumped K's and Q's out of the bowling bag. Inside was mostly some of those pale ivory folders, some colors, he was holding in the bowling bag that was broken in just right after many years of use and a satchel that was somewhat falling apart. Alex had been working part time freelance at an ad agency. I knew something was up because of his attention span and his preoccupation. HE had lots of money. He was in and out. There was a young boy and a young girl. The boy was photographing the girl. I told her to hold the cat so she'd get some real expressions. The family was staying at the beach. When we got back, Alex was standing outside in a towel. He was hiding out. They were after him for something. I tried to get him to tell me. I could see worry in his face. He brought belongings. He told me to get all the damn animals out of there. He couldn't think. Eileen was doing a class and asked us to act out cleaning. People acted vacuuming and sweeping and scrubbing. I stood leaning against the wall. My father came in to get rid of Alex. He took a shower and stood in front of class in his towel that didn't reach all the way around. I went and told Alex he had to leave. He panicked and told me they were after him. The cops came. He disguised himself and a black man claiming to be him said wasn't I gonna kiss him good-bye after all that time we spent together. I didn't. I said goodbye. Then Alex, disguised as an old man, started running knocking things over with a gun inside a stocking cap he held in his hand."

Chuck's mother said Chuck used to play out in the busy highway in front of their house when he was a little boy and he caused terrible accidents. Philip Martin said he was going to kill Chuck with the very pistol Chuck had traded for the army men. But when Philip went to shoot Chuck, the shot gun shells were too old and he didn't know how to re-pack them. The school lunch room was busy. It was just before lunch. It was the most hectic time. A lady worker asked me if she could have my orange. I didn't really want to, but I gave it to her. I was riding in a car with a sunroof with Elena. I wanted to hear. I was hearing the song. It was beautiful. Debussy. Claire de Leu (La Mer) and it went on for 2 hours. I was humming. There was an aluminum barn. Chuck was bammed on the outside doors of the aluminum barn the cows were in. They were getting mad and ready to stampede. A swinging gate went across and back against the fence (180 degrees). The little boy could fit between the fence and gate but the cows were gonna be mad! I showed William Chuck's army men. He loved them. My mother had planned a Christmas dinner party. Invited me, her and 3 guys she wanted to match me up with. She said she'd picked the seating arrangements by chance--over and over till they came out how she wanted. I started telling her about Chuck's army men and she walked away."

As soon as I finished moving and cleaning my room I could go to the darkroom and print. I went ??? It was big and nice and I looked for a way to make the oblong and ??? Jasmine had to leave and looked at the new darkroom. My mother came by and was putting lady-ish touches around. I got on the train. I went to see Ziggy Stardust. The next show was at 9:30. It was ???. Nothing could be. I got dressed in the only clothes there. A plaid skirt ripped off short. 2 young girls--Lolita types--were giggling and dressed like school girls and an older man was list--giving them a ride to school. It did not matter they were late. They might not get there anyway. I walked by the church where little girls in green girl scout uniforms were lining up. Lots of them. Little ones, taller ones. There were lots of other little girls--little--4, 5, 6, 7, 8 years old. Not much older. They were sitting in the church yard around a tent, when they lined up there. Across the street. Hundreds--thousands of little girls, little, were sitting in the grass at the Presbyterian Church. More were coming. They all sat on the grass and clapped their hands fast as hummingbird wings and the dresses stayed still. You could see thousands of blurred little hands clapping, the girls cheering, there bodies still, sitting in the grass. In their spare time they sewed on patches, squares divided into triangles. I walked out a door into the snow. When I was returning to the inside of the Woolworths, a foreign family that spoke no English was coming out. The little girl, about 3-4 years old, was ancient. I accidentally bumped into her as I was coming back in. Since they didn't speak English, I didn't say anything. Then the child said to me, \"You could've said excuse me!\""

Now I had 2 pictures of pianos. The other was at an angle--like a shot of a car. I got to the dinner and assumed I was late, but others were coming in late too. We were splitting for cocktails. At my table were people I couldn't relate to. A boy and girl in love who only had eyes for each other. 2 women with grown children and all they did was talk about their children. A very, very tall horsey woman who didn't talk much sense was stuck with me for conversation. Her sentences were live wires--popping around (hopping around?) in crazy directions and going suddenly dead when the power went off. Snakes, black and vertical, in the air. ??? I had stopped talking. I was given 2 names to write on the black board. Lots of TOSOKO. The people next to me were trying to be polite. ??? We both wanted to hear and Dora picked some off my plate with her hands, because she had no plastic fork and because she liked to do it that way. \"Leave some for me,\" I said. It was the end of the world. Highways were empty. I took the car as far as it would go up frontage road to connect to the highway. A guy drove up the wrong way on an exit ramp and asked me directions. I was standing outside the car--looking at the road."

She was past being concerned with such things as appearance. K-Mart was said to be having a sale on old Halloween masks from the 30's. The masks were wax metal, you could put them inside your mouth, bite down and the mask would grow out over your face. But when I went to buy some, and buy extras for friends and experiments, K-Mart didn't exist any more. It was as if K-Mart had never existed. I went back to get ready. A black boy with a fairly new dope habit was on our front porch. He needed a fix and was getting antsy. He started yelling at his friend. He was getting desperate. I went to take another shower in the outside shower. \"2 showers a day?\" a fellow said, who was trying to get a conversation started. \"Yep,\" I said. And that was that. I was wearing a 1950's, early 60's one piece aqua-blue bathing suit to take my shower but I wanted to be naked outside in the world. Stephen had been up at the green house, sitting inside a red car, holding $10. out the window, hoping a dope dealer would pass by. I still had to get ready. I put on a black shirt. I took it off. I was wearing a blue shirt, very high on the waist, and I put on a bra under it and an olive green shirt of Dora's over it. I could see down my shirt and it was sexy to me. Before I left school, I was helping some very small children get down the steps of the church. One little boy was not any higher that 4 inches. His leg joints and bones, one--one leg were made of wire. A dentist did the operation, and instead of attaching a foot, he attached a huge index toe to his wire bone leg. He went down 2 steps. They didn't have a teeny foot his size. Minutes to work. Gauze and overwork were everywhere. The little toe-boy's father came in and picked him up, because coming down the stairs had worn him out. I was living at Grandma's house. The case workers were coming out to make sure it's alright--clean-wise. Grandma had left it pretty OK. I didn't know how to give them directions to get there. All I could think was Grandma's house. I'd never needed more that that and didn't know how to say."

We had 3 weeks to make it. It was suppose to be organic. Rudy was in charge of the project and had an insulated bag to carry the salad all over the country and to London if necessary. In California there were organic vegetables at every shop--but there was a beach and we wanted to spend our time there. When it was time to leave I couldn't pick my clothes up off the floor. I stayed at the beach house. There were security guards making the rounds. One fixed a big plate of grits and breakfast meat. I was trying to tell him we grew up on grits nearly every day. He was not listening to me. I was talking but nobody would listen. Then it was time to get back to the salad. Rudy came back and we went to Aunt Joe's and Uncle Gene's. Their house was changed into a summer camp for rock and roll kids and the other side for Christian youth. There was a sign out front that was orange. It said, \"Fishing @ 90 m.p.h.\" I was confused by the sign. It seemed too fast to be fishing. Uncle Gene had painted a sign and a \"Anderson\" coat of arms on a black board with white paint. The letters were blocky like he made them with masking tape. It made me mad that he took our name for his yard. The crowd was getting bigger to make the salad. Dick was in from London. Lots of hip rock and roll kids talking with Rudy, laughing, getting lost in his stories. The Christian campers had started moving in on the other side of the house. They were--each group--trying to sing their music louder. A lady, a boy's mother from the Christian group, was next to me, working out on the weights. When she yelled, \"sliders,\" a guy with big, black army boots would slide down the pulley and kick me. I asked her what they were doing.

There were no \"no picnic\" signs. We decided to live at the picnic. There was a teeny little trailer for me. Very teeny and very, very small on the inside. There were dancers, enough to make a tribe. Mess, clothes, used towels scattered around and NO BATH MATTS! So I went to the store where they had lots of bathmats. Pastel colors I didn't want. It was small and square and almost black. Then I saw the one I wanted. It was like a shammy with Velcro all around the sides. There was a history pageant. A trip back to the 1700's. People were walking across a stage. People walked across the stage--a line of them--they were not used to wearing clothes like that, and looked more like a herd of cows than people. I stuck out my feet to look at my silver slippers. They were beautiful. I went to show that I knew how people walked then--wearing all those hoop skirts and everything. The girls in the pageant were vain. With the centuries old, and dresses they wore in the latest styles. Then I went to Linda's store. A guy who was Linda's partner had hurt his back. He had called a special cab to come in the middle of the historical pageant and pick him up. The historical pageant had to start early because it was mostly old people in the audience and they were falling asleep. When I left Linda's 2 people were there. A man and a woman. I knew but didn't know. A different guy connected??? There was a man, a politician, wearing a suit standing in the ocean in his shoes. Waves came over and he would run. Campaign promises he wrote in the sand and the waves wiped them away. The politician laughed like crazy people. I had to go to an address in Chicago. 330 something north side. A strange cab stopped. There are not yellow cabs in Chicago. I was working on something and when I looked up we were on the inter-state--an abandoned parking lot outside the south side of Chicago. The cab stopped there. I had been putting make-up on in the car. Now he was going to rape me and kill me and I knew this. When we passed a sign that said \"69th St. South, I tried to jump out of the car. He locked the doors. I honked on the horn--reaching over and fighting and hoping another car would help. College kids packed in a car looked and sped away laughing. I started praying out loud and saying Bible verses, because I'd heard this sometimes diverted killers. Some of the words I got wrong. So I knew he'd know I wasn't really a dedicated Christian. A girl called Rudy from Chicago. He remembered 2 cab services that he suggested she try. Metro Cab and Mary Alice C"

There was no light on the porch so I screwed a light bulb in a cylinder that came from the wall -- so my father would have a light next to the bed to read from. There was no lock on the door but my father was not scared. When I was staying there, the criminals were on the loose. When I was screwing a latch onto the door, the 2 criminals came to the door.

Silence. Holy silence filled the air. I thought I would talk to her to find things out. She was standing in front of a book. I thought it was full of ancient, age-old Chinese knowledge, and she could translate for me and tell me about the art. But when I got closer I saw that it was a Catholic prayer book. It started with \"Hail Mary,\" and she said it would cost me $10 for her to explain it. I didn't care a flip about Catholics, but I didn't want to look cheap, so I told her I didn't have money with me, so I'd just look around. She went into the kitchen to talk with her mother, who was making soup. I started looking around at the Chinese art that was thousands of years older than any Catholic stuff. I knocked a mop over and it caught fire and the mop landed on a scroll and I picked up the mop to beat the fire out and hit it against the carpet which was a very, very old Oriental rug. It caught fire too. Finally I got them both put out, the mop fire and carpet. There were big mop-size burn marks on the scrolls above my head. I was trying to make them go away when the plants got in my way and started breaking off when I touched them. The front of the temple had been clean, sparse and holy. There was a little front room to the temple. It was a little closed-in front porch. Me and the Chinese boy went to have a picnic on the floor of the front room. A little dog was tied to the chair. The couches and chairs were covered with old cloth and rags. Very dirty. The floor was covered with old clothes, walked upon for many years. The place was very dirty. You walked back through the door and it was the holy temple. You walked out the other door and it was dangerous traffic flying by that would hit the screen door if you opened it too wide. I went to look for Paula in her church. She wasn't there so I laid down on the floor to take a nap. I went to peaceful sleep. I woke up and saw art on the walls. A guys work I didn't think was any good titled \"Christmas on Halloween.\" It was paintings of motorcycles in the sun. Harvey's work is between 2, and his paintings on the left, 4 on the right. I said, \"I used to sleep in an empty room this size when nobody was here.\" We were out in a park like a farm. An overweight army guy who liked to ride motorcycles was trying to find his future wife. He tried to dance with Christine but the chemistry was not there. She brought him to me and I thought, \"He wanted to marry her, now 5 minutes later he wants to marry me. He just wants to marry somebody. Anybody will do and I am not anybody.\" I went down the hill and he followed me and asked me to go on a motorcycle trip to Texas with him. He said you had to dig holes in the ground to get drinking water. I said, \"Why don't you just go to peoples' houses and knock on the door and ask if you can use their hose pipe. He said, \"Camping is not like that.\" I said, \"Well that's what I'd do if I was thirsty.\" I went to take another nap, but Harvey came to wake me up with a question. There were more questions. A kind of question game had started up at the counter at the diner. They wanted me to play but I didn't. I had 6 notebooks of Dora's to sort through. Lots of papers and writing and psychology papers. Even the cloth belt stuck in the notebook was precious. I didn't want to throw anything away. I wanted to save every piece of paper from her studies. I unfolded everything. I opened a folded newspaper, thinking it was a psychology article, but it was a whole page, a drawing with thick strong lines of a little girl ballerina--drop out white on dark, dark gray."

Dramatic titles and war ravaged, truth seeking heroes--always misunderstood and usually in the military or at least the CIA. Me and Mary had stayed over at Marianna's. It was now very late Saturday morning and we were getting up. There was a fire escape in the center of the building--where the chimney used to be and girls from other apartments were just starting to get up with towels and sit on fire escapes. Marianna met me at the door with one dollar bills. An artist was doing an installation and signing his name with mashed potatoes. He also needed a big pile of mashed potatoes to write his name in the mashed potatoes the way you'd write your name in the sand. But not mashed potatoes spread flat and thin like sand--a mound of mashed potatoes, lumpy as a landscape, and there was one baked potato on the table. I was going to Key Food to get some mashed potato mix with the right texture (Marianna's words). On the way I stopped at a NBA basketball game. I was sitting on the floor beneath (behind) the backboard with my kitty and while I was watching the game she ate the baked potato. The basketball went out of bounds to kitty and she clawed the basketball open and started eating it too. I went back empty handed but Key Food was open 24 hours. This artist was also gonna carve his name into pears. Marianna asked me to go to the library and get some pears. The library was late opening and the staff was hung over. Sure enough, a chef was at a table cutting up pears and putting them in plastic bags. I told him I needed some whole pears--but they all had cut marks in them. Some were beautiful green pears with warm spots of red. A guy on the train was trying to get to Williams St. and another guy gave him wrong directions. I pointed to a stop in Wall Street we called \"Williams St.\" I told him to take the F train. Blue or orange. There were empty plastic bags on the very top floor. The elevators went up and down. There was a girl I was talking to at a diner counter. She asked for steamed lettuce and chicken sandwich. I was wearing a black slip. She said she was a painter. I asked her about her art. She said Velcro in playgrounds. I thought of the little girl drawing but her art was Velcro escalators. A couple had a one week old baby in a white dress. The guy was wearing the baby's bonnet on his head. He handed the baby to his friend with one hand. The baby's head was wobbling. He didn't seem to care. His girlfriend had just had the baby I guessed. He left her, walked away down an escalator. I rubbed her stomach gently--it was sore. Her nipples were sewed--tied with black surgical thread and I wondered why--if it had something to do with childbirth. When I got home there was a secret message, with the new address rubbed out and the name rubbed out--the only legible parts were clown school reunion and the town which was foreign in Europe. I called right away--with the door wide open, sitting on the floor when I realized Zeb had been sitting--perched on the back of the couch with his chin in his hand--his elbows propped on his knees--all along."

It was a big machine with gears to make it run. You had to pull out the trays, fill them with dirt and plant little seeds inside. The growing plants would give the ice cream machine power to run. There was a box of chemicals I wasn't sure if it was fertilizer or poison. The guy told me to shovel it into the trash can and it would disintegrate the trash. The customers had finished dinner and ordered ice cream. They told me what they wanted. I couldn't remember. We didn't have that many flavors anyway. Then you had to fill a paper cup to put in the metal slot and it worked like a water wheel or windmill. When one was frozen you had to take it out and fill the spot to keep the balance. Then the shift was over we had to do prep work for the next day. Since it was ice cream season, the snakes were sleeping. Hibernating in a box. A bunch of them all in the box together. A lump of snakes. Still and breathing just barely. We had to pick out a mat to frame a picture of flowers. They were saying \"Match the art? Match the art and I believed in only matting in black or white but I didn't want to jump in because they were so frantic. I watched an old back and white TV show. We were on the way to dinner. W had been on a ship traveling. Rudy was on the upper deck. There were some dolphins swimming right next to the ship. Jumping in a circle--one after another, like a backwards water wheel. Then I called Rudy to look at the dolphins. He didn't hear me so the dolphins jumped onto the boat and turned into penguins. They tried to go up the ladder to see Rudy, but they couldn't maneuver the rungs with their flippers. They were trying. We were walking with the picture framed. A lady was taking apart the frame and mat and art and back all to be carried separately- \"What are you doing?\" I yelled and I put the frame back together. Jasmine was now disappointed in the green-beige mat and went to paint it white. I was learning to skateboard. While I was waiting I learned skateboard tricks. Doing OK too. The older man was trying to set himself up with me--pair off, but I just concentrated more on skateboard and playing Evelyn's guitar. Dora was going to get a haircut. To the place she always went. Since we were still on Mott St. I decided to go to Wendy's and get a salad. The college girls working there wore bathing suit tops. They had all been laying out topless and their breasts were very sunburned. They took off their tops at the counter. I asked for a salad and the girl was not paying attention and she put it in a paper soda cup. I asked for a glass of water and it tasted like toothpaste and I asked for another cup. A teeny baby toothbrush was attached to the lid of the cup."

I told her I'd been posing naked for artists. She asked me which ones and we talked about Raymond Kushner. I found a little girls sandal. It was after a yoga class. Women were talking in the locker room of how they felt good about their bodies. I found the sandal on the square wooden porch with a roof. I picked up the sandal. I wished it would fit me. There were words written into the leather. The brown beads were wooden. I had to go work at the county fair, stacking trays of food. My mother was after us 'cause we were late. It was the \"famine-feast\" at the fair and there was a huge feast. There was a black boy who was looking very sexy. I had to keep putting more trains in the stack."

It was a long road back to Laurens and I wondered, if I drank the coffee, where I could go to the bathroom on the way home. There was a very steep hill. Midway down was Veronica. She was wearing an elegant black cape with a beautiful curved deep neckline. From the edges of the shoulders and trimmed in beautiful soft fur like a fur boa almost. I wanted to take her picture. I had one shot left in the camera. I had a present for Veronica. A little yellow chair with an Eiffel tower in it. She liked it. I'd taken the last picture and a boy was gonna let me ride his bicycle down the hill and take pictures of me but there was no film left. My mother was doing room inspection and I was afraid the lady would come back and get me. I had left my camera with Veronica and forgotten about it."

We were in different places. I could not see Dora. I walked across one roof and looked while Linda and Marianna had been working. Linda's newest store was on Lafayette. The entrance on Crosby. Marianna had been cutting out wooden dolls with a chainsaw. Linda was getting a show ready. Lots of little dolls and stories and photos she'd cut up for the stories. About the people not having money for a place to stay--so one person checked into the mental hospital and everybody slept in/under the bed with him. There was a picture of the guy in bed with a blanket and so many other faces cut out and put in there with him. There was a break with a fashion show of Linda's dolls. Soho-ish ladies were there. One had on a lightly sequined pale green dress with buttons and labels across the back. 4 labels on back, one on front. \"Medicaid\" one said. She was a high-class society lady trying to look hip. Linda had a sister named Lee--who used to be a crack head and lived in the park. Now she was a skydiver and adventure enthusiast. There were dolls to paint. One person said, \"This should be relaxing,\" and I said, \"You have to concentrate like if your ears are real dirty and you're trying to clean them out and you just can't get them cleaned out.\" \"A good analogy,\" Linda said. I was painting in the girl. ??? Dora. He said his Dad was killed by a drunk driver and I told him about ??? Marianna had found my old invites. They did not invite me. William was driving. He had a dark blue mustang. It was parked in the yard. There was a beautiful butterfly painted in the intersection of the road. A mysterious person had painted it."

Under the tree--near the center of the area was a big tree and the grass didn't grow very much in the big circle area under the tree. It was mostly leaves, twigs and weeds there. But you had to run the lawnmower across the entire yard. You had to cut the grass. There was no doubt about that. The deer under the tree froze--got scared by me and the loud noise of the lawnmower, but there was nothing I could do. The yard to cut got bigger. It was behind the Abrams house. I wasn't cutting in straight rows, but loops and curves and arcs. There was a hose pipe laid out--loops and circles too--and I kept trying not to run over it because the lawnmower would chop it up. A woman was sprinkling salt into a small container of rocks and water. The salt would stir up invisible but you could still taste it. It was for her husband. The salt would keep things from growing. Poison. There was an algebra test. I had all the answers for it written. ???. I couldn't help but laugh over Dora not being able to dance. When I took the test, I'd erased strategically, so it'd look like I had to work out the answer. On my desk I had a stack of albums and notebooks. One had a funny drawing of a blue monster on it. I held it up for a guy across the room to see and we laughed out loud. Next on the stack was an album by a band called \"Twig Boy.\" I thought the name was so funny I held it up too. I went to the building next door and saw a man in a blue sweat suit, ringing the doorbell. I recognized him as being a runner I saw every morning in that sweat suit. I went to speak to him but he was not attentive. He was going on a ??? purposes. He was ringing Ben's doorbell. Ben came out and they left. I went by the store before going in. I got 2 cans of coke and 2 quarts of water. I went out on the back porch to look for something. It was night. A hand was reaching up and had cut through the screen. It was a man's hand. It was holding a rusted metal spike, razor knife. I knew he had climbed up on something to break in. And the evil way his hand was groping, I knew my hand had to smash his, but I was afraid he'd stab me with the rusted spike. More than afraid. I knew it would happen. So I picked up something, I had no time to find the best thing to use as a weapon--and I crashed down on his unsuspecting hand. (A he was reaching up from below, his head was below porch level, so he couldn't see me.) I came down with a bang and started screaming, \"Call the cops! Call the cops! Call the cops!\" I was stuttering. I'd been stuttering all through everything. I hoped my father could hear me screaming so he could call the cops."

It said, \"Although 90 percent of Americans prefer white meat on a turkey, but on a turkey, only 30 percent of the meat is white. The problem is how to meet 90 percent of the people's desire with only 30 percent of the available product. The story went on to tell of Thanksgiving meal fiascos in a pretty way, and was mixed in with a newspaper article about drunk drivers. I had to memorize a part of a Shakespeare play for a dinner party. I didn't know if it was a performance or just entertainment for us. The guests at the dinner party. I was memorizing the part I was in. I was doing a part with a guy next to me. He was foreign. He said he could do 120 drawings of objects but he could not make a painting. I told him about a painter from high up in the mountains. He told me the name of the country. It started with a \"P\" or an \"E.\" I couldn't remember it. For the performance or dinner party, there was a round cement table in the center. In the middle of the table was a porcelain bowl, set into the cement with designs inset. Then it gradually became cement. The leaves and grapes in cement--the design on half of the circle. I painted it all pale green. Then the paint could be wiped/peeled off the porcelain, but stuck to the cement--to the leaf designs--and you could peel it off a little and it looked like the leaves were in motion. It was my job to set the table--a fancy table--with glasses for red wine, white wine, bread dishes, butter dishes. I set the table but then realized I had forgotten to put the tablecloth down, so I put it over the dishes and glasses. The guy said he could pour the red wine if there were glasses on the table, but (that) I'd forgotten and there were no glasses. \"Sure there are,\" I said, \"they're under the tablecloth.\" We were on a train. ME and Corinne--when Corinne went to sleep on the train she was a woman from another time who always wanted coffee. She wanted sticks of chewing gum too and I had some in my pocket. There was a little boy on the train. With his mother but all by himself. He knew everything--you could tell by his eyes. He never spoke--there was no need for him to--everything was in his eyes. His mother went to sleep. He strayed from her. He stood close to the doors--watching them open and shut--knowing something in his eyes--a slight calm mischievous smile on his face--but everything in his eyes. His hair was the color of mine. It was curly too. His mother knew he was suppose to get off by himself at one stop--and so he did--she was barely awake. He was alone now. His mother had fallen sound asleep again. He walked calmly down the platform and while the doors were open, he came back into the car ahead of us. I had to keep sight of him. Everything people knew of him or expected of him was wiped clean. The train was his world and he was everything. I knew this little boy was the key to light and life and everything anybody could ever want--because of his eyes and the energy they emitted from the little boy. Detached and immersed, at the same time. I was mesmerized by the little boy and at all costs could not lose sight of him. There was an artist whose art was to cut out pieces of the road with a jackhammer and/or chainsaw. The dean of the college was upset when he went in somebody's room and saw a piece of the road on the wall. The artist would cut his squares 4, 5, or 6 feet square from the sides of the road--where the white and yellow lines were painted. The artist, he/she liked the wear and tear on the paint on the pavement, where the paint wore off the top of the small pebbles in the road, and the energy of skid marks next to the slow-painted solid stripes--worn down by many years of cars driving on them. When I came up I saw the forklift and a square of the road cut out, but still in place--I knew the artist had been at work. A farmer in a pick-up truck stopped to talk to me. I was worried he'd call the patrolman about the road, but he was stuttering and stammering was all that came out. He was trying to pick me up. I didn't know how to operate a forklift. If I could get the slab of road onto the forklift, I knew I could figure out how to drive it, but the road was too heavy and I knew this. The farmer didn't even notice the road missing."

One flew up out of Greenwood Lake and landed right on top of Sotheby's. To try to prevent this in the future Sotheby's was getting a surveillance camera to photograph their places once every hour. I was in the army. There had been a huge flood. Disease was rampant because of the heat. We hiked, looking for damage of the flood and possible survivors. The flood happened because of the drought, the water couldn't seep into the ground. After the flood there was a fire. I went to a group of psychiatrists' offices. I had been there before. Behind the reception office was a door. Behind there was a long hallway and then it went in a big, big square, the hallway. I started walking around the hallway square counter-clockwise. I looked for a door that I had been to before. Some of the office doors were open. All the psychiatrists were men but not the psychiatrist I was looking for. There was a rack of round shirt collars, cut off from the shirts. They said, \"20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's. You could buy a t-shirt collar to state your age group. It hadn't gone over as good as they'd hoped. At sunrise I walked down a road where the water was. Fog was rising over the water. When I was walking Dora appeared and I wanted to hug her, but my arms were full but by the time I emptied them, she was gone. \"It's like this every morning,\" I said. As I was leaving the psychiatrists office, walking the last half of the inner square, the heavy cloth pillow case filled with onions broke and landed on a pile of harvest display nuts the secretaries were getting ready. They could keep them in the display with the various nuts and squash and gourds, but I wasn't sure if the pilgrims had onions . In a Volkswagen bug the engine and seats had been taken out. I was at a residence beach where there were private schools only. ??? ??? I went up to the top of a very steep mountain. At the very top was sand remains of an ancient village. The sand was beautiful colors and was moving slightly. There were volcanic geysers barely active there. I knew to walk on the edge because the sand could shift and give way and swallow you. Around the top I dug a trench in the sand wall to watch the sand slide down. I tunneled a little gap in the sand wall, but there was enough of a ledge to walk around barely. There was a shelf of damp sand around the edge that would not give way. A girl was looking for the laundry room of the mountain. Stairs were built into the mountain, a stairwell tunneled into the dirt. The natives inhabited the mountain. The holy chief of the natives was very, very dark. He had a headdress of white feathers around his head in a circle. He was very wise. His body was concise. The most valued possession of the natives was a pick-up truck, but the chief was the only one who knew how to drive it. It was old, black and smaller than the average pick-up truck. Me and a guy got in the pick-up truck with the chief. The sun was starting to go down. It got very cold on the mountain top when the sun set. The guy asked the chief if he could borrow a jacket, and the chief gave him a beat up umbrella. All bent up and ripped, but you could tell it was a generous gesture, and hard to part with. About half way down the mountain, I got out of the pick-up truck, because I wanted to see the stairs inside the mountain. They were circular stairs, and there was only about 2 feet space between the floor and the ceiling. Since the handrail was circular, I slid down it and ended up in a swimming pool. I wanted to cut my hair one inch long. I had been waiting for her. Waiting for Dora. People were either working overtime or going to lunch. I couldn't concentrate on anything else because I was waiting for Dora. She was getting a salad. I knew this. We were meeting my father at the city Park to play tennis. I got there and saw the bus. The courts were full so we went fishing. my father caught a big one and the kitty was walking right in the water, looking for fish. She did not mind getting wet at all."

I wanted to tell her it was big art, not schizophrenia, but I didn't say anything. Aram liked my project. We had a break from class and I went and put on some huge white socks with fuzzy green stripes. The socks were the size of snow boots. I had a pale green cotton warm-up jacket too, with a hood. I figured if it was too warm, I could fold up the jacket and use it for a pillow. I went to the bathroom and a girl was in another stall. I thought the seats were too high, but she said they were just how she liked them. I fell to sleep sitting on the toilet. I woke up and the girl was gone. I was late for class. I went to get a soda and rushed to class where they were all watching \"The Ten Commandments\" with Eileen on a black and white static-ky TV in a garage. My father was moving from the Franks house. I took a shower. The tub overflowed. The shower stall overflowed. The sink overflowed. There was lots to pack. Jessica and another girl kept hanging around, asking for candy. They said they knew it was there from last year's Valentines. I told them I didn't have time to look for it. They found it under the sink. It was all stuck together. Jelly and candy apples and red-hots They were happy. The were going to shave a dog under the house. They were euthanizing a dog who'd lived there a long time and I didn't want to leave. Dora was sitting with the dog. The dog's puppy was playing and didn't have any idea what was going on. Water had flowed over everything so it was hard to pack. Nick was cutting things out and working very hard on a little art project. my father packed up the 18-wheeler and Aunt Linda, Uncle Bob and family, My mother and me got in the truck. Going down a big hill, my father picked up speed to make it up the other side. Just when we started going up the hill on the other side, Aunt Linda said they had to get right out, because Uncle Bob had spilled his soda and because he was diabetic, he would lose all his energy. I thought this was selfish of them, as we would not be able to make it up the other side. My mother's lower eyelid was stuck in the steering wheel. It was pulled out 3 or 4 inches away from her face. The steering wheel was pinching her eyelid, stretching it out. I knew it must be very, very painful, but she sat without showing any expression. \"You know I don't have any lower eyelids.\" She said when she finally got her eye pulled out of the steering wheel. It looked painful. Back at the house I was packing up the last stuff. Nick had worked all night on an art project to give to Raymond as a present. He had covered a piece of my paper with pale green paint and written a note to me asking me to give the project to Raymond. I told him (Nick) (that) I didn't want to give anything to Raymond. He said that Raymond had a bigger name than me, I told him that was not true and my name would be big, and I rubbed the note out. I told him I was an artist, and he said Raymond was the closest thing to an artist he knew and that made me mad. I was ranting and raving. He had worked all night. I said, \"He wasted a whole night on a no-good artist and you didn't even see my work spread out in front of him there.\" I had gone home. When I got there I sat down to play the piano. The Halloween and Christmas music got mixed up with classical and the notes were mixed up. I was trying to play it anyway. Dora came in and wanted to play and I told her I'd just sat down, to let me finish first. But then Dora was gone and the lady from the library was trying to take my picture and I was crying so I asked her not to and she said, \"Why?\" And I said, \"Isn't it enough reason to stop because I don't wish to have my picture taken right now?\" People were donating parts of their bodies to bring Dora back. A black man showed me his certificate that he had donated his skin. I hugged him from the piano bench. When Dora came back she didn't look the same. Her skin was drawn too tight over her mouth, nose and eyes, so it looked like she was always screaming. The TV news did a special and made Dora look awful. They accused her of being on drugs because she had to wear 3 different pairs of glasses to see the world how it was--one pair of bifocals over her chin. She rolled her eyes and lifted her head and they showed that close-up and over and over in slow motion. It was a football game promotion and I was ready to kill that camera news lady Betty."

I saw Theo standing on another hill and I yelled as loud as I could, \"Hi Theo!\" A girl was trying to get the record to play. She couldn't quite get it. She knew it did. So hard to get the record to play. She said, \"I'd like to get a hot dog. Watch what I do.\" I found a piano notebook. ??? I was working on the job. It was a job everybody hated but we all needed. Every once in a while 2 big mafia-like guys would come in the work space and grab somebody--lift him off the ground and carry him out the doors. The worker was always terrified. The rest of us were paralyzed with fear. We had to keep working. When one guy got carted away, I was the one to take over his job, making hot sandwiches on whole pita bread--uncut. There were stacks of square wax paper and round stacks of pita bread you were suppose to cut a slab of hot meat into 3 pieces while it was on top of the pita bread. First you had to put down wax paper. Next to that you had to put a couple of sprigs of broccoli and a dollop of sweet potato soufflé on top of the green. For color. While the guy was showing me, ashes from his cigarette dropped on the sandwich. At first we blew them off, but then the guy decided to toss it out and start over--because ashes were sprinkled over the food and he didn't want the big boss to cart him off too. Maria was sitting, hugging her knees, in the backyard under a bush. She was very happy. She was in her own world and not on earth. She asked me for a cigarette and when I gave her one she sucked in like heaven. I roller skated once again over next to the piers where the health food stores were. There was a class. It was a discussion about old paintings. Messages had been painted into the paintings hundreds of years ago. One painting had an important message for the unborn child of a pregnant woman in the class. A French painting. The painting had no words, the message was just a picture of a young tree. New trendy pizza places had opened up on this street. 3 fancy new restaurants. I had left a phone message for a guy named Perkins about him not being in class and the woman he was in love with was there. Jasmine told me he was very upset about the message I left. We were climbing a huge hill. I was on roller skates and just before I got to the top I had to skate down again. It was so steep and I couldn't decide what to do. I was driving. At the turn in from Hickory Tavern I missed the turn and went into the high school parking lot instead. I didn't see the stop sign. I thought I hit the driving instructor. He filed a report while I typed a poem on the computer that Chuck had left me. One line was, I thought: I want to know. But really it was: I want you to know. Chuck had left a toy skunk in a tree on the left and a monkey in a tree on the right. I traced their outlines through the car windshield. Grandpa was driving and stopped at the curb near the post office and opened the drivers' side door to look at all the stickers inside the hinges inside the door for the car maintenance and race car stickers."

They would not go in any turnstile. I was at a McDonalds to get a soda. One girl in line there was very sunburned in the middle of winter. Another girl was there with one normal leg and one real skinny leg. She was wearing shorts. When I went out, a group was doing an escape from McDonalds. They had been working and living at McDonalds. A black woman, a white man, and his 2 little boys. The woman was sad to leave McDonalds but she knew it was what she had to do. The little boys came out carrying duffel bags. On each end was an insulated Dominoes delivery box--insulated. They were packed and ready to go--waiting outside in front of McDonalds for the right opportunity to escape. They had a plan. First they would act like they were getting in a car. Then they would get out and get in another van. The man would walk and run, and I would skate. Odds were, some of us would make it. We figured it out scientifically, with a chart on the temperature butter fat disintegrated. I stopped and got 3 cans of soda. I was eating a banana. All mushed up.

I was practicing piano and when I got up to go to the bathroom an older lady took over and was playing dance hall music. I went to iron some clothes and I wasn't wearing any clothes.

Some channels had other foreign languages. Always the same clown in glasses and his buddy. The real film was starting.

I found a smaller lid to put on the pot and turned it off. It would keep cooking. We had a town meeting concerning Dora's death. The man who killed Dora and his family were speaking. A postcard had come from Europe. A lady on the ??? wrote on the postcard she was trying to lose weight because she could only see 16 of her toes and not all 20 of them when she looked down. Near the cash register, I had snot on my hand and I slung it off on the man's back who killed Dora. Then I ran. And jumped into a bush till he went away. He went up to speak on stage. I came in. His wife was there with the slide projector and I couldn't help but make snide remarks in response to what he was saying. He said, \"We all loved Dora.\" I said, \"YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER!\" I was mad. I got out my camera to shoot pictures of him while he was talking. I really wanted to shoot him with a gun. I knew the camera would make him nervous because he was lying already. His foot was tapping nervously. So I took a close-up of that. Then I got in tight on his face and he sweated. The film would not advance. I'd made him so nervous with the camera that he'd forget what he was saying. I announced to the crowd that I didn't have any film in my camera anyway. I said, \"Dora was a little girl too.\" The lady removed the picture. She had been projecting slides of their children, and mumbling, mumbling. I climbed over to huge steep hill and slid down the moss. Deep in the caves were little leprechauns. The colors were green, purple and orange. Rudy had come over for supper. He had come on an underwater jet that swam like a dolphin playing. It was the newest of planes. There was a home-furnishings and art store I'd been in. I went in again and looked at the art painted on the walls with distance. A hooker followed me and on purpose hugged me, but I paid no attention. Maybe she thought I was cold. Aunt Linda had drove us onto the wrong road. The man who killed Dora asked me, \"Are you a leader?\" \"Are you a leader?\" because my house was up there. I did not answer him. U.S. Army reserve."

We were all sitting on a ledge about to start the installation. An ice skater was working out choreography. A catchy in and out step that made you want to be a good ice skater. William was installing neon lights to make a shadow of the ice in colors. I was suppose to work on a mural design. The first was partly up there. We looked at it. It had snowmen on it. Then William asked me to do one and I did chaotic Christmas lights strung on nothing. Jeffery said the clocks with the snowmen were just inviting surrealism speculation and that was asking for trouble.

It was 11 a.m. She was to get there by 1 p.m. Since bathing suits were on sale at Belks, My mother thought I should get one. We went to look at them. I wandered off by myself with weird contacts in my eyes. One was my father's college ring. I had the idea to get a necklace made with 3 stones--each stone exactly the color of my eyes, Rudy's eyes and Dora's eyes. 3 shades of blue. I looked at a rack of hair ribbons. I liked them. One was brown with wide frayed edges. I tied a blue boa-ish feather in my hair. The stem broke and stood at a crazy angle. Frothy blue billowing as I walked. When I got back my mother was looking at the swimsuits. One was an old blue/navy one like hers. Others by Catalina had little cotton daisies embroidered. The one-piece blue, navy/white suit like my mother's old one was $1.29--but it disintegrated when you touched it. We left without getting anything. When we got back I realized I had not taken a shower. And Dora was due back any minute. When she got there she looked beautiful. Her hair was very blonde like when she was little. Thick. Cut with short straight bangs and just even with near the bottom of her ears. We stood in front of the bathroom mirror, holding onto each other's shoulders and looking into each other's eyes. Alive sparkling with love our eyes but Dora could not stay. As soon as she got there she was gone again. The kitten was on the living room floor playing with some lettuce. It was alive, the lettuce, and it would jump, hop and move by itself. Then the kitten would jump the lettuce and the lettuce would try to hop away. The kitten spinned a lid into the clover and jumped--pounced after it--on top of it in the clover. WW III happened. I was riding with my father in a school bus, looking at a book of tornado statistics. For the months of this March/April the book predicted tornadoes--I looked on my birthday to see the likelihood of a tornado hitting on my birthday. We missed the school bus. In the bus lot school buses were blown in a ditch--the roofs pulled off. The tornado had hit and we didn't have any food. Time was running out and my father left the barnyard--he pulled the freight. A mother and her near-grown son were eating their lunch in the front door. We walked in and asked for something to eat. \"I'll cut up some more cabbage,\" the lady said and she left to go to the kitchen. \"Can I use your bathroom?\" I asked the near-grown boy. I had to pee very bad. Keith had been on a trip to Mexico but was apprehended and now was in a total darkness treatment center for 6 weeks."

A waitress was on the run from the law in a convertible--with her new husband. She was about to divorce him if necessary. She had a little daughter. She was going to leave with her mother and cross the country--working in diners by night. She knew that at night time she could hide easier--working out in the open at all-night diners and truck stops, where time stood still, and cops would sit for hours with coffee and pie, killing time while the shift clock ran down. Her husband was driving the convertible. She had spunky blond short hair and glasses. Next to them on the highway was another convertible. A sex kitten older woman with the biggest red hair-do I've ever seen pulled up and made a move on the husband. She was about to divorce him anyway, so she (the wife) didn't care really what was going on. She was on-the-run with more important things to think about than petty jealousy. Into the sand, you would stir with a stick and say the words \"mars\" and after you said, \"Mars the Red Planet\", the sand would get lots of finer sand in dark red powder--like black cherry jello mix swirled in. Mixed more and more. Then you'd pick up the sand on the beach, pack it down a little--wait and the little teeny baby space creature would come out.

John Harrelson was at the table and he said he'd met a boy, 30 years old who was cross country skiing 12 miles to come see him. Across from me were 3 gay guys and 2 sharing one fold-up metal chair. Then I saw the boy in question riding down a huge steep hill on a dirt bike with dust flying behind him. We were on a train. There were 5 extra stops on the line to transfer from. On the 5th stop was a ladder of metal rungs going up a huge cave wall to transfer to another line. When I transferred there a time before, I hadn't seen the ladder and had climbed up a tree limb through a window. A park bench was in our front yard and 2 guys were sitting there drinking water. Ackerman and another guy. They were talking about tennis courts. The other guy said he would never make kids learn to play tennis because the sun would get in their eyes. I said you should learn to be able to play no matter where the sun is. They filled up their plastic water cups with the spray nozzle on the hose pipe I'd turned on the night before. My mother came and yelled at me about the wasted water. I got defensive and said Ackerman was drinking water too. She said she was gonna squirt water under the skin on the back of my arms and I'd have cancer if I didn't make an appointment like she said. I was trying on some blue jeans that had tiny, tiny patches of cloth the size of snake scales sewed on in a vertical pattern, ringing in very muted colors of greens, blues and purples. Like Joseph's coat of many colors. I didn't know if I loved the pants or just wanted plain Levi's. Aunt Linda said, \"If you keep running your butt will get smaller. You will look good and the town people will talk nice.\" There was a huge, huge pencil drawing--too dark--on the table in the basement of the church. It was huge overall but each individual section was the size of a fish scale. The drawing was underneath, but smudged over and I had to carefully blot it with an eraser to reveal a big, huge delicate drawing of Dora's face.

Some were postage stamps of women from the Royal Family. Some were books of leaves in pictures in the beautifully designed squares of intricate, tender drawings of leaves. The pictures were still, but moving. The leaf would hesitate and then sway, as if to fall from the tree or open up majestically. In the locker room was the project on movement. One thing they showed was a baby hooked up to an I.V. of blood. The baby had unhooked itself, though it needed blood. The baby needed the blood from its mother, but the mother had AIDS, so getting the blood would be slow sure death. So the baby had unhooked its own arm from the I.V. and walked away. Disappeared.

One pig's curly tail was just above the surface of the dark water. I thought, \"Oh, great, the sharks will love this. They probably never had pork before.\" I waited to fell sharks at my feet. Finally they tossed about 30 inner tubes in the water. They were bigger and clumsier up close than they'd looked from the huge ship deck. I slowly commenced gathering them on a string together.

He said a certain kind of pollen--the next county over had gotten out of control and when the spray truck sprayed insecticide it gummed up the pollen and this county didn't have the antidote and it was painful but harmless. I got a grocery cart and got groceries. Toys and appliances were mixed with the groceries--it was hard to tell front from back. I looked at Chinese vegetables but I got a strawberry popsicle. I was walking home eating my popsicle and I dropped it and Brittany came with a spoon to help me scrape it off the road and save some. She had a lot of it. I had the rest.

Home was in the church office. I kept looking. She had a pencil sharpener in her office. I saw her pencil, my pencil, she pencil, ??? office, with the blinds drawn. He was afraid to leave the church. A maze. Stones to write about the house. Down a hall way I was asking her, I had to get clothes ??? piled up old clothes. The preacher's son was Phil and he uttered an off-hand remark about me skipping church with my camera. Counter point. I got lost and tried. ??? or just as ??? I ran. There was a sauna for a few minutes on the way. I went in--it was a place to think. But I saw the urinals and realized I had accidentally gone in the men's sauna. I ran out. My project was a trampoline. I jumped in the shower, not haven taken a bath for a week. Christian applauded me. Keith sat behind the blinds there scared to talk. I nearly bumped right into Stephen. He screamed a notifying full of anger. I was terrified. I ran. I hoped to escape. I was in a movie theatre. Names and ratings of films flashed across the screen. I did not see any things I wanted to see. Me and Chuck were sitting in a car that wasn't moving. We were planning a trip. I was bringing up other people who might want to see Chuck, but he wanted just to go on the trip, me and him. A woman held up a doll to the window. I took a picture of the doll's face. Her face stayed the same. ??? When we were driving a guy tried to open the door from the outside. \"You can tell he's never experienced death,\" I said. He doesn't take it seriously. Me and Chuck were so comfortable in the front seat with each other. All stretched out and touching, right up against each other, not sexual. We drove past Miss Flora's house. It had been torn down. Trees had been uprooted. The swimming pool was still there. Chuck said, \"Betty, you're as relaxed as a boy with the whole day in front of him.\" I was leaning against his chest. We pulled into a family campground. Cars with trailers pulled behind them were lined up at the exit. A patrol man was talking on a walkie talkie about the leads. One driver, he said, only had $20--taped to the inside of a tire to get home on. But the car was dependable, he said. A guy was sitting in the car with his girl friend and the patrolman went to ask him to roll down the window. It was major league baseball autograph week. It was Derrick Jeter, also called Black Jack Mulligan, in the car. The patrolman went to the window to ask for an autograph. \"You're Derrick Jeter, some call you Black Jack Mulligan,\" he said. They had to go to the bathroom. He was changing clothes inside the car with his girlfriend. I caught a ride back to the campground with a man and his wife, and wanted to go to the bath house to go to the bathroom. I pulled up young bamboo shoots and planted them so they'd grow into trees around the new lake. To make it look more natural. Derick and his girlfriend were trying to think of the right thing to say to each other. They were in the lobby. They were asking if I was gonna eat there at the diner. The girl and Derrick were trying to say the right thing to seduce each other. A waiter brought a dish--3 fried eggs and toast, called, \"3 eggs on the run.\" The girl I didn't know, she said, \"I always try to join in on today.\" I said, \"What day is it?\" and she said, \"It's Thanksgiving. Identical plates were helped and a table stood, full of them. From memory: Dora was sick. Very sick. She couldn't speak or move. I picked her up and carried her to the airplane. There was only one seat available on the airplane. I put Dora on the plane, because she had to go to the other place to get better. Then I tried to get on the next plane. Stewardesses were in the restaurant of the airport, because the next flights had been canceled. I waited. A stewardess was complaining about having to serve 7 kinds of salad dressings in first class. In coach she only had to serve 3 kinds. I finally got on one plane and transferred planes and got back to Dora. I carried her and laid her down gently on the ground. I sat next to her. Ackerman had been watching us from a parked car for 8 hours. I didn't know if he had been taking pictures, and I didn't care. I had collected 2 kinds of balloons for Rudy. Shiny mylar balloons and regular ones. Only one red shiny balloon was left. Nanny didn't want Rudy to have the balloons, but I went around on the merry-go-round and kept them there, tied to a tree."

The weight room turned into a thrift store, but all arranged by solids/stripes. I found an old cotton cut-up football jersey I loved. I was at a picnic. The Kennedy family had a tree house there. They had a tall ladder partly painted, partly just metal, not painted, that they took down when the press was around. They had a tall vertical sign, hand-painted that said, \"The Kennedy's\" There was a fountain. A very old concrete water fountain. I was trying to put a post in the ground for a volleyball net. The net was already attached. It kept leaning over and the net was not taught. I kept trying a few inches over to dig a hole. We tried to put the post into a metal drain. We took off the cover. Inside was a pool of water. A copper whale had been in the water, covered with the lid since we were little. It had a hinged mouth that moved. I said, \"Look, Rudy,\" and I held the whale out in my hand. A film had won for best documentary about whales. It cost $1800 to make. The film was about whales in captivity--the female whale had died and with her died any chance for baby whales. They put the male whale to sleep."

I was suppose to go to my high school reunion, but when I walked down through the gate I decided to go play the piano instead. It was 11:00 p.m. I had played the first 2 pages of a Chopin Nocturne (in E flat) when Andrew came bustin' in that I woke him up and he was gonna write a complaint to the landlord. He said instead of me playing could we go look at my art upstairs. I said, \"Can I at least play the last page and then play the whole song once more?\" He said he would call the police. And could we go look at my art work or watch the TV. Then I said, \"NO. Because you're being a JERK. I thought you were a nice guy but I wouldn't even want your eyes looking at my art.\" He said, \"Well can we watch TV?\" And I pulled all the electric cords out of the power strip at once--a fist full of electric cords. It was getting late. At 4 a.m. Evelyn came over and asked me to go to watch the Butterflies of Love video shoot. They were shooting at a bar on 13 St. Between 1st and A. I said, \"Are they about to start?\" and Evelyn said, \"About 6 or 6:30 a.m. they'll start shooting.\" I said, \"Evelyn, that's so late (early?) and I'm so sleepy.\" But I decided finally I would go meet Evelyn. I walked into the bar. There were many rooms and hallways. I went into one and it was a huge dark church--very dark, with velvet movie seats--dark, dark blue. Evelyn was wearing a dress like a little girl and had to go accept her certificate at the front. After Evelyn got her certificate I had to go home and boil some water before I met them. It was getting later. When I met them and it was a dark big room. Cameras were rolling out. Film cameras. I didn't see them, but I heard my name. They were at a table. William, Evelyn, Ackerman, a guy I didn't know and a girl there with Evelyn. Evelyn was entering a boxcar derby and talk at the table was getting serious. What could she build a car with? She didn't have much money. \"A shopping cart!\" I said. Evelyn wasn't sure she could win the box car derby in a shopping cart but then I started breaking off the legs and bending the parts to show how it could work. Everyone thought it had a good chance. Ackerman was happy that I broke and bent the legs of the shopping cart. He said he really admired the way I did that. I was filled with new confidence. I said, \" Evelyn, it's getting late,\" and Evelyn said, \"We need you for a party scene,\" and then it started. They were using a quarter horse in the shoot. He was buckskin colored and beautiful. They needed me to walk the horse down a long, long pier through woods with sand. The horse was tied with a long long strip of ripped canvas (like to paint on) about 9 inches wide and 100 feet long. I knotted it around my hand. I was talking to the horse. We got along just fine. I tried to tie the canvas around my waist--so not to lose him, but his lead was getting too long. We came to a swimming pool with steps. The horse wanted to go for a swim, so I led him in the water. William said, \"Merri--you and that horse are gonna be seeing a lot of each other!\" I was glad. I liked the horse. It was time for William to start singing. Their back ground dancers were warming up--gyrating madly. Girls of all races with proud belly buttons and long skirts. Hair pulled back from the face. I still had the horse. I walked back and forth on the long pier board walk to the shoot. I lost my balance and fell into a shallow-ish end of the lake. I could see the bottom covered with small dead fish--gold fish size. I didn't want to step on the dead fish. William said, \"Merri, don't be playing in the water with the dead fish. We're about to start shooting. Come on to the set.\" I went, but I was all wet, having swum above the dead fish without stepping on them."

Burning and dodging them--but it was all one even color--neutral shades--but in color--fuzzy and blurred even marbles drying and stacks of paintings on large paper or strips of canvas. A tour group came in but I wanted to go dark and roll my film. I had to wait, so I left to come back. I sat a table with 2 ladies. They were talking about Rose O'Donnel and I got loud. \"I hate her, I can't stand Rosie O'Donnel. She's a fake and she's not funny--SHE'S THE MOST ANNOYING PERSON ON EARTH!\" The kids didn't know what to say. Corinne came to the door. We left to go to the darkroom. Corinne Christian was there and he was old friends with Colin (Coleen). A guy I knew--but didn't know who he is. Corinne knew. She had come to listen to me play the piano. I got my music. We still weren't dark in the darkroom. A lady was interviewing me for a scholarship. I asked her to repeat the 1st question My brain was wandering. The words were technical and meaningless. In a van I stared at Stephen--he would not look me in the eye. His energy was on the edge of the edge. Scary. Shifty. We rode past the mayor's house. Stephen yelled out the windows. In the darkroom were stacks of embroidery. Ladies had woven bedspreads of all kinds. They were neatly folded. One was white and knobby like lace. My mother had made it. A man in a suit held it--wanted to buy it--exclaiming how beautiful lit was. It was cotton with little fringe."

In the drawing a man leaned over petting a little dog. A notice was posted that doors would be fixed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, if anyone knew of a broken door, or if anyone just wanted one propped open--guards would move huge planters with plants (tree plants) to hold the doors open on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Andrea White had been cooking for 800 people. It was a big event for the building with dignitaries. Oprah Winfrey had on a guest who made a quilt out of dough. It was called \"Baby\" because she worked on it the whole time she was pregnant. It was ivory and navy, with patterns sort of like bandanas. Then it would turn to a natural (neutral) color. It was patterns. In the ink, on the dough, were the daily notes the man had written to his wife while she was pregnant with their baby. There was a meeting in the auditorium. She (Andrea) had cooked a native Mexican dish. Oprah tasted it and screamed. It was hot. She kept fanning her mouth and exclaiming. She had very long fake acrylic nails. I saw the quilt. I did not think it would be very warm and comfortable--old dough. I wanted to make my own quilt. I had seen bad art--terrible art and was determined to do something that mattered--took a year. Dora loved my quilt idea. The paintings I saw made me mad--terrible--a man dressed as both groom and bride, on the floor wrestling with himself. It was a bad painting of a good idea. The paintings were done by the people from the drug treatment unit. A man was feeling power over others. He had been intimidated too long. He was mean to a lady who didn't have any teeth. She cowered, but laughed contagiously. She had no money. Another guy was leaning--he tossed a drain into an empty grocery bag in a fire place--a quilted and non-working gold house.

Me and Tommy got $5 and went to think separately until we moved on. Dan visited my father and told him some crazy reason his feet were sick. my father told Dan it looked like the wind would blow him away. I was in a truck. A girl on a bicycle, not looking in the direction she was going (her head turned backwards) and rode right into the truck, but my father stopped in the nick of time.

I was at a grand opening and a big mansion. I was sitting on the floor. When I got up to leave I looked in the fridge for a soda. There were 2 cans, but I decided not to take one, because they belonged to somebody else. I didn't know who. When I got up I could see that there had been 2 people, sitting on a couch behind the column watching me. They were watching TV too. I had turned the TV off and turned it back on. A girl came to talk to me. I thought at first she was the younger sister. I told her this. She was happy she appeared younger. But by now her face was much older. She suddenly got tired. She showed me a big swollen scar on her left temple. Hair wouldn't grow over the scar, so she had an odd asymmetrical hairstyle. I was in class. I thought I recognized a guy from last semester, but it wasn't him. Because the girls were clustered on the left side of the room, and the boys on the right, they asked me to move my seat over to the boys side. So I did. When I left class I was roller skating down a wall. A guy was making me take my skates off, put high heel shoes on and jump down. I told him it would be much easier to jump down in my socks--a waste of time to put on shoes and take them off. We were in a hurry. We stopped at a rest area to go to the bathroom. The place was crawling with transvestite teen hookers of both sexes. I went to the ladies bathroom. The line was so long I went in the woods. Because of all the hookers, I told the European girl there was no need to use a rubber to just go to the bathroom--she screamed at me-- \"Don't tell me how to go to the bathroom--I'll decide that for myself.\" I walked away. The teen hookers were strolling or sitting on the curb with hip bones showing over low-slung skirts. They sauntered languidly. One was sitting on the curb playing with his little puppy. It was weird to see that thin young boy--all elbows and knees, with a skirt and a bra and all that make-up playing so gently--just a young boy with a puppy."

I went back to the room. An extra bed had been put there. A stranger's. They had put in a bed much bigger than the tiny ones for me and for Elena. I went to the beach. The day had disappeared. It was now 4 p.m. Young Asians, some with bleached blonde/yellow-ish hair were walking on the beach. An Asian girl and boy--both with bleached blonde hair were holding hands singling Olivia Newton-John songs. They could sing good--especially the girl."

It was notched iron like a bed frame. The brothers came. 7 brothers. I was suppose to be with one of them. Marry one. But it kept changing which one. They loved music. I had wrecked their car. The little 2 room cabin they had was on the rock. A little bathroom where you had to climb through a window on the roof to get in was at a slant on the side. When I went in I pulled on the roof to climb into the window and the rock tower. The cabin was attached and came crashing down. First I thought it would fall on me. I stepped aside--it crashed to the street below--a winding mountain path. It took out most of the bathroom and their color printer that was in there. I went back and they were marching to the Barnum Bailey Circus music. I wanted to hear my father's swing music he had calm in his body. He leaned quiet against the fence. The brothers said they had not woke up enough. One brother who had been badly burned and had cancer and took to his bed. The other brothers marched around the perimeter of the field. ???
