I don't want to go, and I tell Uncle Albert that someone is coming by to get me at 11:00 a.m., but it makes no difference.  Someone does finally come by for me, though:  Uncle Joe.  On the way home (or wherever we are going), we stop at an old school (2-storey) where summer school is going on.  I am to tell Pat Byers goodbye.  There are about 8 rooms on each floor.  I go to the door and look in each one.  Everyone is apparently having a lot of fun.  When I am spotted, I get in trouble for being out of class, but I explain that I don't go to school there and I have come to tell someone goodbye.  I am beginning to think that I won't find her when I see the back of her head, in the 16th room upstairs.  I tell her goodbye-I don't remember how..  By the time I go back outside, it is dusk, and almost dark.  I wait until dark for Uncle Joe, look around the building, etc., but can't find him.  I am growing worried."

As I am standing by the bench, Coach Bowles tells me to play center field.  This means I may get to bat this inning.  The coach gives me detailed instructions on how to hit the pitcher-how to stand, what to look for, etc.  I look at the pitcher, and to my amazement he is just lobbing the ball.  And the fences-strangely wire now--are ridiculously close.  The batter just before me makes the last out.  Thinking the game is over, I walk out of the gate.  Then I find out that the game is not over.  I ask the lady selling tickets if I may go back in, since I just came out.  She says no, so I watch the rest of the game from outside the fence.  McAddo High loses.  Aunt Aimee says that some friends are coming by to take them home.  She doesn't want to ask them to take me home, so requests that I call Grandpa, Mother, or someone else to come and get me.  I am greatly dismayed.  It is 11:30 p.m.  Somehow I get home."

Grandpa finally has to do it.  I cry a while and then wake up, greatly relieved to know that it was just a dream.  After I go back to sleep, Grandma is showing me how to load a shotgun-wadding, powder, shot, etc.  She says to take \"3-inch balls\" out of a can and drop them in the barrel last.  By 3-inch, she means 3 steel shot about twice the size of a BB and one about the same size as a BB.  We then go into the woods to hunt.  The woods in Uncle Joe and Aunt Wilma's vacant lot in River City, I am pretty sure.  The first thing we see is a rabbit.  I lower my sights and track him.  Grandma keeps saying \"Shoot.  Shoot.\", but he runs between us and a house.  I think the shot has rolled out of the gun barrel, but I am afraid to look down the barrel and see.  As we come to sort of a cliff, Grandma finally looks down it, and I was right.  We go back to the house and pick out more 3-inch shot."

Grandpa tried to straddle them with the wheels  When I looked back, amazingly he had done so with the twins, but the single boy had apparently raised his head while the car was going over him and was struck by something under the car.  When I looked back, the twins were standing over his body.  We ended up at Uncle Jack's, in a house similar to the one at 606 South Wilson."

It is so wide and thick with grass that with all my power I cannot strike a ball across it.  There are also numerous obstacles such as shooting around a corner when you come out of the first two wickets.  Once, when my turn comes, I see my ball lying within about one foot of another ball, but as I draw closer, I see that it is quite a bit farther.  I hit it, however, and upon taking mallet's length to take two shots, I must lie through a doorway or a wicket or the like.  This means I will have to swing almost parallel with this object in order to strike my ball cleanly and at the same time miss the corner of the object.  I shoot at another ball, about 25 yards away.  With the first shot, I miss the ball at which I am aiming by several inches."

The next day, I believe, I meet this girl on the bus (in my hometown), and we get better acquainted.  She seems to like me, and lets me put my arm around her.  When we get off the bus, I hold her hand on the way to her house, which seems to be on Newton or Richmond or Sandusky.  At this point, she seems to be Phyllis Rogers.  She asks me if I want to kiss her.  I look up the street to see if anyone is around, and then I kiss her.  We go up to the house, and I remember I don't even know her name.  At this point she seems to be Emily Koch, although she looks nothing like her.  I take out my address book and sit down in front of the house.  She says her name is Emily Myron, and her phone number is (something like) J1-01J11.  Just as I am starting to write it down, her father comes to the door, a small, slightly rotund man.  I stand up.  He says, in a rather brusque way, \"Don't sit on my flower bed again.\"  I say, \"Yes, sir, but I don't think I was.\"  But I look around and sure enough there is an impression in the dirt, which I touch to make sure it is real."

I catch one, and the other crashes to the floor.  With this delay, I am the last one out of the museum.  When I get to the car, a station wagon with Mrs. Witherstone driving, kids are piled up in the back seat almost as high as the ceiling.  Mrs. Witherstone, however, is the only person in the front.  I figure there must be some reason for this, so I tell her I will ride on top of the car.  I sprawl out on my stomach on top of the car, but as she accelerates, I start sliding off, so I jump off before we get moving too fast and run alongside the car, keeping up quite easily.  Next, we are downtown shopping and we come upon two \"pee-pee stations\" side by side jutting out onto the sidewalk.  The front wall of these was made of almost clear plastic-sort of milky translucent but not completely transparent; nevertheless, you could see through.  Jimmy Creagar went into one, and Patty into the other.  Doug and Jimmy Duggan watched intently from outside.  I needed to go too but had no intention of making a show of myself."

There are runners on first and third, and on the next pitch our catcher steps across the plate as if to throw to second.  We all think it is just a bluff.  But then, seeing the runner decide not to go to second, he makes a weak throw to first, which doesn't get there.  The runner coming in from third stops about 3 feet from home and watches the ball bounce a ways past the first baseman and doesn't continue until it is retrieved.  When it is, the first baseman's throw to the plate is high.  I make an instinctive lunge for it, but stop."

There I found our car, terribly bashed in from the rear, and the motor in the floor of the front seat.  I went and got Sharon, but she could hardly bear to look at it.  Then Daddy more or less put the blame on me.  He decided it would cost more than it was worth to have it fixed, so he bought a new one-a Chevy, I believe.  We were looking at it on some kind of clay or sand flat when I saw a huge red, hairy elephant.  It must have been 50 feet tall, with huge long legs and a long trunk.  I remarked to Daddy, isn't that a huge elephant?  He said they were all that big.  Then the elephant started toward Daddy, who had some peanuts.  As it was about to get Daddy, he threw the peanuts to me.  The elephant came after me and soon was sucking my hand into his trunk.   (The peanuts were in the other hand.)  I would pull away and run, but the elephant could overtake my 20 steps in about one.  I saw I couldn't run away, and was afraid he would trample me, so I threw the peanuts at him and continued running.   Sometime later, Daddy and I and possibly Sharon were sitting in a garage.  Daddy said, in a nice way, \"You still haven't admitted you're not a very good driver for what you let happen to the car.\"  I almost burst into tears.  (When we found the car wrecked, the windows were up and uncracked, and the doors were locked.  Daddy thought I forgot to lock it and the thief locked it after abandoning it.)  I tried to tell Sharon what I thought might have happened-someone hit the car where it was parked, and the police towed it to the place where we found it."

I put him down and give him instructions on how to get out.  When he gets down to the next floor, however, he seems to be Rover (our dog).  I can see him over the landing, and tell him to enter the open door of the elevator, which will automatically close and go to the next floor, where I will have him repeat the process."

I know they have been drag racing, and I am very mad when I found out Nancy was in one of the cars while they were racing.  I put my hand on the windowsill of one of the cars and it has blood on it, which gets on my hand.  On the way back we pass a house about 40 feet off the street.  It is the Ottos' house, and I see Robinette Otto lying under the window.  We stop and find out that a magician had been showing his tricks, had wrapped a cord around Robinette's neck, the end of the cord had broken off and it was too short to unwrap, and she had choked to death.  I am very shocked, and I want to cry but can't for some reason.  When we get home, the Ottos' house is still near outs, and as I pass it I see Mr. & Mrs. Otto and Laurie.  I ask them if there is anything I can do, and Laurie says they would like to have some Scotch tape.  I go home and find we don't have any, so I am going to go to the drugstore but they change their mind.  I try to comfort Laurie, but none of them shows any emotion of any kind.  I am halfway convinced that I am dreaming, but it seems very real.  I am very sad."

On the way, a smart-aleck guy gets on who won't give the bus driver the 7-cent fare when he asks for it.  The bus driver drives on anyway.  He is a very short, mousy man with a tan leather jacket.  Later I notice that they are sitting together.  When Nancy and I and the bus driver get off at St. Bernard and Broad, the other guy leaves, and the bus driver is really glad.  He says the guy was going to kill him.  I have an urge to do something about it, but I don't.  At this same place, I discover that I am not wearing church clothes.  What's more, I realize it is Saturday.  I don't have any money.  I ask Nancy if she has any, and she says no-only 20 cents.  For some reason it seems that is not enough.  I don't remember how we get home.  It seems like there was some really dramatic action between the bus driver and the other guy.  When we get home, there is a long cardboard box like department stores use, and its lid is moving up and down very slightly.  Daddy says that some dog discovered that Grandma Clifford had been buried alive.  They dug her up, and she was still living.  The lid is her breathing.  I never do see her.  Sharon is there, and as I am going to tell her about this, I see a card which has been sent to us, like a greeting card.  Mother says Uncle Ben has died, and I am horrified.  I open the card, and inside is several clippings and a full copy of my hometown newspaper.  One clipping has Uncle Ben's picture and part of a headline above it which reads \"Higgins Second Only to ....\"  I wonder if they could be the second richest people in my hometown.  The clipping is an orange newspaper like the local newspaper late editions, and so is the whole newspaper, so I look through it to see if I can find the whole headline.  I can't find it on the orange sheet or anywhere."

At one end of the platform is a pole about the size of a good-sized flagpole.  It is the end of a long machine serving as a conveyor belt or something.  It looks just like the rear of a 1958 Cadillac but stretched out to about 40 feet long, with scallops and dips in the whole length of it.  The molds have scalloped edges too-sort of like a cornbread stick mold or a knife sharpener.  From a pulley atop the pole, an iron block is quickly lowered by a rope which I hold.  Each one falls into a mold and assumes that shape.  Once, I get up onto the platform to try to do something to one of the molds, but the person I am working with says my hand will look like one of the molds.  So I use a stick instead, and retreat back over the molds.  The footing is very tricky.  There are also some large black oil drums.  I'm not sure what the \"Cadillac\" thing is, but every once in a while one end rises way up and comes back down.  On the opposite side of the machine is a large tree, and beyond that is a little store.  You can't see the \"Cadillac\" from the back door of the store because of the tree.  I take someone around the tree and show them the machine.  They are amazed.  I stop once and go in to see if Jim Wheeler has come yet.  He has just got there."

Pretty soon a fat gypsy came around the corner and told me he had seen a couple of boys running toward the woods.  I set out for the woods, wondering how I would go about such a task as killing a person.  I thought I would ask him first, \"Why did you kill my father?\"  I felt the side of my leg to see if the dagger was still there, and it was.  When I got to the woods, I could see a few people at various distances, but realized that I didn't even know what this killer looked like.  Soon I came upon a clearing where the old woman and another woman stood.  They were just leaving, evidently from visiting a grave.  There was a garage nearby.  The old lady said to look through the crack in the door and I would look \"right at his nose; he's hanged himself.\"  I reluctantly peered through the crack, and there, hanging by his feet, but definitely very much dead, was the purported killer, with his mouth slightly open in a sardonic grin, all his teeth showing.

It gets pretty windy, but I don't think the funnel actually hits us.  Grandpa and I go outside, and there is just a wispy black cloud left floating over.  It is almost dark, and something hot and glowing drops onto the back of my hand, and another falls on the ground.  One is a sort of miniature jeweled dagger.  Both are 5 or 6 inches long.  By the fence in front is a saw with a yellow handle and some other tools.  I ask Grandpa if they are his, and he says no.  I can't figure it out at first, but then I remember how objects are picked up by tornados and deposited elsewhere."

On the way down, however, I decided to let go over the water.  I kept falling and falling-not slowly, but pretty fast, like going off a high diving board.  I wondered why I hadn't hit the water, but discovered I wasn't over the water at all.  I don't remember hitting the ground, but the next thing I realized was that I was inside the house kneeling beside a chair or divan with my head on it.  Daddy was occupied with something in the doorway of another room, but he was talking to me.  I wanted to try to make him think I was dead, but I would forget and open my eyes every once in a while.
