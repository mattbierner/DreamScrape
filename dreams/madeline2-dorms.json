It was night in the parking lot and my brother Stuart ambled up behind.  I swung around and hit him in the groin.  I had to explain my action, that I didn't know it was him and I was being cautious.  There was chocolate and mint ice cream in a room with a fan.  Some time during all this I managed to take my socks off.  I saw my boyfriend Jeremy and someone else for a moment; I apologized to Jeremy for getting him sick.  Stuart and I were outside watching a castle(?).  It was a dark castle, and flames were shooting out from a barred window.  Then later, again.  It was Satan.  I got scared and jumped below to hide.  Stuart yelled not to, but it was too late.  Satan came out.  I saw his face and heard his voice, but I don't remember.  His fingers were twice the size of mine, blotchy and red.  His fingernails were black and extended about half an inch past his fingertips, like curved hair it was so thin- but enough to scratch.  He touched my cheek.  I was to take an orange pill he gave me, which would blind me.  My brother Stuart had to guide me and we both had to horizontally scale the length stone wall to which we were left clinging, twice.  We were doomed if we failed and fell."

            "content": "I wasn't sure where at first, but it turned out to be school.  At first there were like Ferris wheels or something.  Then we were recruited into a half-constructed house/warehouse.  It was kind of like a Navy thing, kind of like a prisoner deal.  All wood, no windows.  Everyone was on the floor, except for those giving orders.  They had us do pushups and such, but I couldn't get my right pinky out from underneath my other fingers.  The girl next to me was counting erratically.  Then we were supposed to pair up and construct wood panels to add to make a very thick front door.  I was alone in the task.  Then I was at home, and my maternal Grandma Jane was asking whether she should throw some white bagels away.  I was then back at college, and passed the swimming area; like a summer camp.  They were playing some song about 'fat girls'.  I woke up.  I went back, and had a sort of continued dream.  We gathered around the outside of the building, going to put up the door we'd made.   When we went to put the door up, we were punished for one of the panels (sandwiched) coming off.  I was going to go on the side of the building to try and fix it.  The house was to be some sort of gauntlet.  I stepped off the side, and in the field, bees started swarming me.  More and more with each step, flying around, on my face, my arms.  There was one on my left cheek that sort of tickle-hurt.  Like metal in a mouth with braces.  I haven't had a bee dream for a very long time.  I thought it was interesting, and refreshing, dreaming at all."

            "content": "The dream started at home, I guess, and I was chatting with my good online friend Del.  Its sequence was actually later, before I was to sleep at my boyfriend Jeremy's, and I was waiting for Jeremy in the room.  We arrived at his house, where I was going to stay for New Year's Eve.  Jeremy wasn't around; he seemed to disappear after we got there.  So I went into the guest room off to the left, and took a nap.  I woke up and saw my mother through the doorway at the table.  They were about to have dinner.  She saw me and came in, invited me.  I went to the bathroom, and at this point, the house was the way I dreamt of my maternal Grandma Jane's when I saw my dead uncle alive.  My great grandmother's sitting room had an entrance to the bathroom, and there was another on the other side.  I walked back to join the group (now it was the front portion of my parent's bedroom.)  But when I got there it was dark, and I could hear breathing, like someone was asleep.  Puzzled, I went into the rumpus room.  I made a mental comment to Jeremy's house being like ours, but then, it WAS ours.  I played the tape my brother Stuart left in the VCR.  At first it was something from Christmas morning, and I was about to reset it to the position I found it in when it changed to just claymation stuff.  And then it was a bunch of people dancing in a small kitchen, with a counter near the dining area.  There were 2 of me with the dancers.  But then my mother walked in from the kitchen talking to Jeremy's mother.  \"Here she is, oh she must not have understood,\" my mother said.  I paused the tape in the VCR and suddenly my father and Grandma Jane were sitting on the couch.  I followed my mother and Jeremy's mother Harriet to the back; apparently my mother's friend Peggy was supposed to be out there too- they were raking gravel, and it was light, not pitch black like it had been.  I went back inside and sat down on the bed in the room in which Jeremy and I were staying, and I wondered where Jeremy had gone- probably off with friends.  We all went to the mall.  I was with Jeremy, his friends, and their significant others.  We were in one store, and I followed Jeremy through the food department.  French bread; I had to ask him where he got the particular loaf.  I went back to the refrigerated section.  Everything seemed partially eaten- empty boxes and bottles.  Jeremy was gone at this time (indeed it may not have been him who I asked about the bread).  I was left with his girlfriends.  I kneeled to get some soda.  There was a bottle of pineapple with a 3-cornered cap.  There was only one bottle of root beer that hadn't been opened.  I didn't find any chips.  At this point we'd left the food section and were standing in a 'down-home' country-feeling clothes department.  I couldn't see the food anywhere to go back.  I decided to let it go and follow the girls so I could at least get out of the strange store.  I complained to the lady at the register about the eaten food, she didn't seem to care.  I split from the girls when I found my mother, Peggy, their friend Jill Block, and some of her other friends.   They seemed to be doing a lot of fun things.  They changed plans quickly; next thing was to paint a chocolate model ship.  I parted with them and walked the length of the mall.  It was short.  The stairs were not conducive to use.  Rickety old wood, cluttered and confusing, with little bridges hanging beside.  I made my way down anyway, and although it wasn't, it quite resembled a basement.  Lots of workers, including my dorm friend Patrick, my longtime classmate Ralph and several others from the high school badminton team.  Finally I found several of Jeremy's friends, but still not Jeremy.  I went up one set of stairs, to outside.  I followed a hanging footbridge and an annoying cocky white boy jumped down in front of me, then jumped to reach the ladder in front of me.  I pulled the extension down and he got hurt, as he was still hanging off of it.  \"Why'd you do that?\" he snapped.\"  \"I guess I'm not as tall as you,\" I glared back.  He let me lead, as he wanted to see me fail.  I stepped over a trip wire, and landed on top of the sprinkler head so he got more wet than I.  It was a booby-trapped tree house.  Having passed all the traps, the boy conceded, and trusted me to send the zip line rider back to him after I rode across.  The adults came out- this is what they had been working on in the backyard.  One guy's wife had done the majority of the planning.  I joined the people in the depths, the underground portion of the lair.  People were running around goofing off- a lot more than there had been.  All the while I was still looking for Jeremy.  I made my way over some rock formations lined against the wall.  There were shards of white laying around, sculpted to look like skull remnants, and it was indeed creepy.  I sat next to a rock that had a face sculpted in it kind of like a gorilla.  I kept my eyes on it for quite some time almost mesmerized and it seemed to change- so that it almost looked like Jeremy.  I hesitantly kissed it.  Then Jeremy's friend was beside me and it brought me back to awareness.  Everyone in the cave but the two of us sitting there was leaned up against pillars, expectantly.  I got up to join the group, and the friend did too.  It was possibly a paintball thing."

I followed Benny down a little leafy path.  I hit a grassy patch and fell on my face. We grouped together for a picture- a lot of the relatives were there.  Ahead of us I watched an old home movie, someone on the porch of a house with a large grey dog.  As the dog moved it morphed into a man in a costume.  Then we got ready for the picture and it was hugging Aunt Fiona.  Tried to get everyone in the picture- family.  My paternal Grandma Fay was on the couch behind me, my mother's uncle Bert and his wife Loretta were on the other side of the camera, as was Ann (supposed to be Alice from the Brady Bunch).  Then Bert and Loretta's son Rick showed up and we wanted him in the picture too.  He took off his coat and my mother asked if he would eat fish (as if he were vegetarian).  I went to the back of the house, turned on the light and closed the door for my brother Stuart who was in the bathroom and I went to lie on my parents' bed with my father- he was curled up in his blue pajamas with the bedspread over him.  He was annoyed by the situation too."

I asked the teacher then if I could go visit.  I was allowed, and got in line to go into the area.  Long line.  I was not allowed in because I'd left my purse and ID with the group.  I begged not to have to go back.  I didn't have time to wait in line again.  I didn't get in.  I went back to the class and sat down in a movie theatre on the left of the teacher, who was not Mrs. Drager anymore, but my university core teacher Sylvia Roan.  I told her I didn't want to sit on her hair, which was lying across the seat, so I moved it."

Jamie had given his brother something to give to us, two little pop-up cards.  One showed an image, motion, like from TV, of him, his brother, and his father at a rocky area, like in the Stone Age.  In the other, we got a small live frog and a mouse.  They were mine, I guess, but I let my brother Stuart look after the frog.

Then about before I left I asked if they had any Ondar CDs.  To my surprise, they did.  I was looking at the selection the old man handed me.  I decided to come back later to look at it since they were closing.  I believe it was this old man who partook in the second part of my dream, which seemed almost as if I were in my obnoxious roommate Chelsea's pledge class, I suppose.  The old man told us (there were 3, possibly Chelsea and my quiet roommate Sally) to grab all our stuff, no second trips (and we had tons of stuff) and go up the narrow staircase to a sort of attic.  There was a rail down the middle, and the right side was blocked with presents.  I headed up the left side despite the fact that the man was coming down with an armload of presents; he was dictatorial and didn't expect me to do something to hinder him.  Indeed, I normally wouldn't have, but I didn't like the treatment we were getting.  So I did not let him down but continued up the stairs.  There were racks of books, like chip racks in a convenience store or gas mart.  I was put in the back room.  Two glass panels were angled blocking off part of a screen that led into the dark of the backyard, I suppose, with a bit of grass and then a drop.  To the left was a fan, and I was putting my stuff on the right side.  I think Bob, my psych TA was there watching me, assistant to the old guy.  The old man came in and gave me more orders.  I was getting pissed off.  I started arguing up in his face, and backed him into the first room where the other two girls were.  The issue was something of a war, and he expected us to fight even though we had nothing to do with it.  I was yelling in his face, and he would argue back.  I got so mad I actually pushed him backwards, knocking him and a rack of books over.  With tears in my eyes I stormed back into my 'prison'."

She worked here in my college town.  It was dark.  We started out in the back, walking by the tennis courts and the pool surrounded by the handball walls.  The pool was Olympic sized and a bit run-down looking.  There was a large inflatable raft like thing floating in the middle of the pool that I was supposed to jump on.  I landed on my stomach and got a little wet.  How I got off it and back on land I don't know.  We went to the administration hall, in which the rooms were quite cramped compared to what they really are; it was like they were all squished into a train car.  Dana saw some desktop stuff that she'd left from when she worked there.  It hadn't meant much before, so she had left it behind.  Now she wanted it back.  I talked to the principal Mr. Davidson, and it took him a while to remember that she had worked there.  There was a bug that kept flying around and bothering me.  I'd covered my face and wanted to put my fingers in my ears so I couldn't hear the buzzing.  It kept following me, and I wandered down the hall.  I don't remember how, but finally the bug was swatted, and when we stopped to look at it lying on the ground, it was apparently about 4 inches tall, green, and holding a red and white umbrella.  He was known as a professor, and used his bug form to molest women."

A little trouble at first, but I got his mouth on my left nipple, which was apparently all the conditioning it needed.  I felt a maternal connection to it.  While I was doing this, Jeremy was occupied with someone else.  The kitten stopped and the other person left, and I was concerned about the fact that it was like we already had a child, and we'd lost our freedom in acquiring it.  The nanny arrived; she was very much like a man in a dress.  Norwegian, I think.  I talked to her, and she had been confused.  She had though the flight was for 9 at night, not in the morning.  I apologized and Jeremy came in and talked to her.  We were going to let the nanny litter box train the cat, and teach it to roll over, and I felt that while it would be helpful, we'd also be missing out on the cat's life and the joy of having it.  I nursed the cat again on the right side.  This time when I picked up the cat, it was more like a mouse.  We left the room and now Jeremy was gone, but my brother Stuart was there.  We were sitting in a sort of waiting room and the TV was on, but I got excited when I heard the music for Quantum Leap in the next room."

And there was something with my boyfriend Jeremy.  Memory lost because the second part of the dream was so vivid.  I and two others, and a friend of a friend named Ann.  I was going to drive her to get something.  I left her at the car because I'd forgotten something.  There was an assembly in a multipurpose room like from elementary school.  John, who runs the dining hall at my college was guarding the doors.  There were four or six men of a mob-like gang.  The leader was named Vinni; he was short, and wearing a white suit.  I was headed for the cafeteria when someone of authority called out, \"Don't let them in!\"  One, two, three men stepped up before John, one on each side.  Vinni was following behind me.  Not sure what he was after.  I thought about slipping in through the door, but thought that it might entice Vinni to try the same thing, even though he was probably already planning on doing so, as John was occupied with henchmen.  All that was on my mind was what was said, of preventing him entrance.  I knew somehow that it would pose a great danger with so many people inside.  I turned around and stabbed Vinni right in the gut, with a screwdriver.  Twisted it about a couple of times, surprised at the lack of resistance and friction.  He fell, and I silently, as if in a trance, ignored the awes from the assembly and entered.  I turned right and walked up the aisle with so many eyes upon me.  Remorse was already in me, and I knelt, crossed my chest like a Catholic, and prayed.  Not at all feeling absolved, of course, for such a massive sin, even if in the name of good.  As I did so I heard someone from the assembly audience say, \"At least she's got morals.\"  I crossed my chest again and stood up.  I did not bear to look back at the audience, for I was in no way proud of what I'd done.  I had done it, obviously, without thinking anything but that he could NOT get into that assembly.  I continued my silent, trance-like walk up the aisle, and sat down amongst the others on the floor.  I got my sweater-drying rack and something else, and I thought about checking my laundry, that I'd forgotten about it.  Then I was in a greenish room, I suppose like my paternal Grandma Fay's bedroom.  I was on the floor to the right of the bed, and my boyfriend Jeremy was sitting on a chair next to the bed.  I felt bad for the murder but I was glad to have the guilt on my head, not Jeremy's- as if the former part of the dream was 'redone'."

Under boards, roll across on pencils, in the end I got stuck in a pyramidal sort of construction, suspended on the corners only by thin rods of pencil led.  There was an anxious tension as I was freed before the collapse of the heavy wooden planks.  After that I did some stretches- was able to stretch completely past my toes without any pain.  With the splits it was similar- I wanted to feel the stretch.  I could have gone past 180 degrees if there were some way of putting my legs in such a position."

The people who bought our city weren't normal. I sat in the driver's seat of a car, to which they had tied a rope and were pulling.  First on a hilly dry grass setting, and then water.  I noted it was like a magic motion ride, the way the jumps were unrealistic, staying at such a high elevation between gaps of plateaus protruding out of the water that we were driving across.  About two of those, and we arrived.  A small place indeed.  A couple of floating log-ends (rather large, could probably fit 25 people on one).  It was like a grand set of wharf pillars, the wood very textured and floating at different heights.  Some bunched together, others would have to be climbed to get to some higher up.  There were some suspended overhead as shelter.  The food supply consisted of a small box of plants, one small plant for each type of food.  It was smaller than a shoebox, but somehow supplied all their food."

I busied myself again doing something else, and only half listening I started to understand some of the Japanese.  \"Coming to come\" or something along those lines.  Then I was in a house, looking for the bathroom.  One was taken, and I went to another.  No toilet.  Another, and again, no toilet.  I was perplexed and had to go!  I went back to the main room.  It was some sort of spirit that the Japanese family was afraid of.  I went back to the bathroom, scared, and that's when it happened.  I helped the couple out of the house and we ran.  The spirit was moving.  Everyone on the beachfront panicked.  The beach had a lot of people, and large concrete stadium style sitting steps.  I ran down them, past people, and at the base of the steps stopped at the opening of a drainage tunnel.  Blood was leaking out of the higher ones and I got some people to help block off these before it was too late to contain the spirit.  If the blood got out it would become airborne and kill everyone.  We stomped on the tubing that stuck out far enough to pinch off.  A bit later Mulder came out, and he said that what we were doing enabled him to do whatever was necessary in the house to rid it of the ghost.  We were safe."

I climbed the fence and went to grab it, and it turned into a necklace chain- I wasn't surprised I guess because it all had supposedly happened before in a dream.  I handed the chain to my brother Stuart.  In an elevator, I guess we were discussing the issue.  The whole mission was to save his girlfriend Sheila.  We hid off in some place and prepared.

Candy was eating ice cream from a plastic wine glass and speaking to me in Spanish.  I went down to the beach where the suicide had been.  There was a line of men walking by, and one of them suddenly grew to be about twice as big as the others.  I was to figure out why.  There was a demonstration regarding trial air tanks for snorkeling, and somehow this was the cause.  I tried their little air tanks.  It worked at first, but water started to leak in.  I came up after inhaling some water. Then somehow it was like a 'do-over' and Stuart was going to kill himself again.  I talked to him first. He told me that he would leave his life in our (the family's) hands. I told him not to. He was planning to die by some sort of injection. I yelled at him trying to convince him not to. I said, \"If you're dead, then what's the purpose? You wouldn't be able to cuddle Sheila [his girlfriend] anymore..\"  His retort was, \"What, feel her up? I'm not completely horny. I'm happy just to be in her presence.\" and then he continued on with the attempt. Sure he was leaving his life in our hands.  I was angry.  Something happened with the injection and he bled to death instead.  A little later, I was sitting on a log. He came and sat down next to me. I asked what it was like for him to be dead, if he was happy now.  I guess we had a sort of wake party, with lots of food."

I passed my French classmate Briana a couple times and talked to her in French.  The people I was working with finished up and I went to another part with my father where there were people wrestling.  He had a ketchup packet in his hand and I didn't believe him at first when he mentioned them for the blood affect.  But then they started squeezing some, so I squeezed the one I was holding.  I got a little bored in watching and went to pick up a bunch of pens and markers I saw lying around.  I think they were using those too, because most were pink or red.  I went to look at the fish display.  In one there were tiny water worms.  Swimming, they looked to glow brightly and had arms and legs-kind of like the Cingular logo.  One settled on the side of the tank, and looked more like across between slugs and insects.  They were about 3/4 of an inch, and they kind of glowed in the water.  My high school friend Leon said something about them making good pets, and so while people were looking the other direction I lifted the lid slightly and put my finger by the surface to entice one.  It worked, and he came out, but I was afraid that somehow it wasn't something I understood well enough and so shouldn't let it attach to me.  It came out of the water, but before it could get on my finger I pulled up and closed the lid; the thing would probably die if I took it.  We moved on.  At one tank there was a sort of flatfish creature, like a bat ray but about 2 or 3 inches across, and a little taller at the head.  My good online friend Del was there and he said something; the fish came to the surface and started 'talking' to us, in its own weird language and deep voice.  It translated what it said for us, and we still didn't really understand, so we moved on.  Del was looking in the end tank, and I went back to the talking fish.  Again it came to the small open crack, but it looked different this time.  Its mouth was as wide as the end of the tank and had little feelers all around the edges.  It was hard to understand.  It called me Laura and said something about Dennis.  I asked if that was Del and it said yes- the voice sounded feminine and a little echoey now.  I called Del back and it seemed to want to 'prophesy' for us or something.  I don't remember just what, but the stuff it was telling us was important.  Originally, Del had lived in the aquarium to the right of the fish.  I watched the whole thing.  He looked to have the cilia like the prophetic fish's mouth, like an eel I suppose.  He and the other fish in the tank had been close.  Then a girl got angry and started hurting the Del-fish.  He was in danger.  The prophetic fish called to me for help as I watched.  The Del-fish and the prophetic fish raised their tails in the air, I was to cross them, join their power.  I did so."

I was worried about Jeremy because he doesn't like snakes but I was going fast and had to keep my eyes in front of me to look out; I couldn't look behind.  I just hoped that everyone behind me was watching where I jumped or skirted.  We crossed a little run down bridge and ended up somewhere with some people who knew what was going on.

I was trying to come up with good call letters, and the man told me to come up with a Plasticene figure.  I started looking around to move again.  I was looking amongst some huge houses, with little streams and bridges and a cat in the water chasing a floating paper hat in the moat.  I stopped at an open house held by an Indian lady, with thin logs leaning against a tree.  The lady was complaining about the landlord.  Entrance was through the music room- someone was playing a run down piano and another a little flute.  There was a stage.  There was a gash in the wall so it was very thin, and wavered when tapped on.  My old friend Jenna's father was there, and apparently my brother Stuart was looking at the house as well."

The light in the kitchen was on, and I heard my parents talking about insurance.  I yelled, but I couldn't yell very loudly.  The straw moved back towards me and dangled.

I went to the bathroom and found the woman in there.  I hesitated pulling my pants down to go pee.  I started, and the woman saw I had black pants underneath.  She commented about it, but it seemed to make her happy.  She asked me something of the timing of a 7-course meal and it being 8 o'clock.  She was extremely happy and wanted to treat Jeremy and I to it for being the first customers.  This of course made me nervous.  Then she told me the rules to our stay.  No chocolate.  I don't remember the other two rules.  At some point she found out I was vegetarian and took that into account in her cooking.  What she ended up bringing me was a sort of vegetarian stew.  It was very good.  I tempted her to try some.  She picked out a lot of broccoli.  She spit some of it back- she didn't like it.  Then we were in the forest.  Going down from one place, there were pictures on the wall.  I was told one of them was worth quite a bit if we could pick it out.  We couldn't choose our own speed of descent, however.  So we took the next path.  There were several groups and what looked like three trails.  We passed one group with my friend Neil Block and his father Jerry.  We went up one trail, and it lead back around to the main.  Rejoining the group, I led the way to the third trail.  I ended up behind, though.  When I went to catch up, I ran through some weeds that whipped my legs.  I made some comment, and the guide laughed at me and told me I was supposed to have jumped over.  Hard to do when you can't see.  I took some of the weeds and whipped her legs, and asked her if it was so funny while her own legs were bloody.  Someone else had blood all over the bottoms of their shoes.   We went up and were walking on a platform.  I saw a 'sheepcat'- it had some of the fluffy curly hair on the sides.  As we passed a treetop, it leapt at me and bit my hand, and was hanging there.  It was a kitten, not like I'd thought before.  A rather vicious one.  I managed to fling the cat off, and it landed a ways in front of us.   A dog ran past and attacked the cat.  When I got over there the cat was amazingly still alive.  It bit me again and I flung it off.  It fell down over the railing about 50 feet, with a thud, onto its side.  The dog came to attack me, then.  It was heavy, but I managed to fling it also over the railing.  He landed harder, right next to the cat.  While the cat had attacked me, I still yelled at it and told it to run, shake off the shock before the dog got to it."

I knew she understood.  I turned and went back to help at 'my parents'' ice cream store.  I met a few people on the way.  I was going to re-open the store after the performance when a younger girl came out of the neighboring store.  She had curly sandy brown hair and freckles.  She introduced herself as what sounded like \"Shirlotte Kearnsy\"  so I wondered a moment if her name was really Shirley or Charlotte.  I decided it was Charlotte.  She told me she wasn't actually new in town- that explained why she looked familiar.  She was quite a bit younger than I, but I liked her and had a good feeling about our friendship.  Later on, I went to get my pen and pad.  I saw Charlotte and her father, Bob MacKenzie.  He was yelling at her and was insanely mad about something, trying to force her inside.  She wriggled free and I told her to run.  We went and hid in my parents' store.  There was an entryway with crackers and I asked if she wanted some ice cream.  On the door she saw a picture of my boyfriend Jeremy and me.  She saw how happy I looked and exclaimed we must be married and have a ton of kids.  Her small-town country girl thought process was evident in what she said.  I looked at the door and it saw in the picture her and me, not Jeremy and me.  But I told her no, he was my boyfriend and we're very much in love, that people with that many kids lose love.  We laughed.  My \"mother\" was at the counter.  We didn't get the ice cream, though.  Somehow, we found out that the mayor of the town had an affair with someone's husband.  Later at a dinner it somehow came out.  The mayor confessed to her husband, but the man she cheated with looked cold and spiteful- probably proud of what he'd done."

It was, of course, incredibly short on me, but apparently that was okay.  We were in a rush.  I had to teach at the school.  I went to get the keys.  I didn't know if I was taking my mother's new car, or mine.  Mine was old looking and rusted.  I took my mother's.  It was evil.  My mother and Stuart and I were standing in the kitchen doorway to the living room.  Stuart argued with us, and my mother seemed to be angry or uptight as well.  We had some green blob that we were throwing at the car to calm the evil in it- kind of like spraying the glop in the Statue of Liberty in Ghostbusters two.  Stuart was infected with evil, my mother probably was too.  I threw globules at all of us, and we continued throwing it at the car, still in a hurry.  I went out to the street where the car was parked.  The steering wheel was on the passenger side.  It was not a new car.  It was hard to control.  I had the brake with my left foot.  The accelerator responded far too easily.  I forgot the girl, and took off.  I was driving from above, going that speed, watching the curves in the road."

We tipped a rock and slid down it.  There was a mummy living in white rock.  He had braces and was excited about some mouth thing- a guard or dentures or something.  Still, we had to be careful.  One small ravine over another mummy cavern.  The mummies met and fell in love.  Then, there was a new episode of Night Court.  Bette Midler was supposed to be one of the characters.  They all had defects.  Bette I think was supposed to be Markie Post's character Christine.  Her arms were stuck inside her outfit/mask.  Bull took off a mask to reveal a gross ring for a head.   He had a brother with the same affliction.  His brother pulled off the mask of Roz.  Dan, we discovered, was not as tall as I had thought.  It was an illusion because he was levitating.  In Harry's office, a gray cat sat on a ledge to the right of a picture.  His tail slinked down into a lock.  Everyone left and I went and looked in the safe.  It contained an old book- the book Dan wanted.  Two pages had been torn free of the worn old thing.  I started to read.  'When the people chant your name, your power will be unlimited....' Two names were specifically mentioned, one being Laroquette (not Fielding), including some history- someone from La Roque.  I saw somewhere a screen with a line diagram.  Then there was a commercial.  I was lying on my stomach in front of the TV.  My parents, my maternal Grandma Jane, and my boyfriend Jeremy were there.  The commercial showed a woman taking off layers of something, like the layers of a prosthetic limb, I thought, for some reason.  It was netting.  Chair, chest cover with straps over the arms and ankles- sun protection, and I was thinking Jeremy would probably want me to have one."

Red and blue were similar, a diamond, and such like that, displayed around the room like a showcase.  The red, blue (and one other color) Were like flowers, or two-piece flowers.  They were very elegant dresses.  I decided on the red one.  Then, it became a store.  Behind each dress opened up a section of designer-wear following the similar style.  I was a clerk there.  It seemed like the managers of the store were up to something fishy.  They called us to close the store for inventory, or something, right in the middle of good business.  We had to pull in all the displayed clothes back into the 'store' section and close it back into a showroom.  There were a lot of workers.  We were trying to take things back in sections, keeping clothes together, and I wanted to put it in size order, and all facing the same direction.  I was able to do this for a while without getting reprimanded by the managers because there was so much commotion.  My neat-freakish side showing would not be appreciated.  Someone asked if it was tedious, but I told them I liked doing it. I took a load of it down to the basement, and found the shoe section.  The displays were tall and narrow, and the boxes were like for model trains.  I took a small white sandal down and looked at it, was about to help down there in the shoe department too, though decided I wouldn't like that as much.  A woman holding an upset toddler was approached by a teen carrying the same sandal.  The teen was saying the shoes were not penniless.  The toddler was fighting it and complaining.  The mother told the teen that she wanted him to show her.  He held up the sandal and showed two small round inlets.  He pushed up on them to find them empty, and the child squealed, happy to be right.  The mother asked me to get a pair, and I boxed and handed her the pair I was holding.  I told her I wasn't supposed to, but did it anyway.  The other side, there was a pile of stuffed turtles with flowers on the shell, that could flip over and cover the head.  One said 14.95, one was half that, one said free.  I was trying to figure out the deal, because they were all very similar."

There were quite a few people gathered in the kitchen.  2 younger girls.  In my brother Stuart's room, there was a circle of old ladies in their underwear.  One of the young girls entered, also in her underwear.  She was walking on her hands and feet, with her back to the ground.

A person was supposed to enter their social security number before they could get it (paint? air? don't know).  When I asked someone to do it for me, it didn't work.  I wasn't allowed to play.

The sales lady was not nice.  Then I was playing baseball with 3 other people- 2 girls and a guy.  The field was too small, so we were going to move to a real diamond.  A group came and took the first one, second already used, so we went to the smaller, run-down third.  It was hard to play with that few of people.  It got even harder when a group came and dropped their junk down in the line to first base.  We started moving their stuff over.  I picked up a violin.  It had no bow, so I started to pluck, but the strings were very loose.  They only had fine tuners at the bottom, rather than anything at the top.  And there were maybe 8 strings, not four, in reverse order.  I asked a lady about it.  It was special made.  I tried tuning it a little, and tightening the strings so I could play.  I looked again, and there was a string running diagonal across the front and other strings, with no tuner.  I thought that was odd."

I managed the first 3 in one place.  For the last one I had to go to the 'cnoctory'.   There, my old roommate Chelsea was sitting on the ground finishing off what she had to do.  A pink elephant with spring body that walked sideways over itself.  We moved on to a shaded café.  There were little compartments.  I put my little booklet, gloves, my possessions to represent me in one.  Then swimming.  We reached Lake Powell-heading towards the Rainbow Bridge.  I got slammed into a stalagmite.  We went around it.  From behind, there was some sort of mass attack.  I was pulled along in the current.  I saw a sign say something like Zaire.  There were some small statues, about a foot tall.  If you gave it part of yourself, they'd come alive.  I told Chelsea to use one.  You had to give five things.  She said, \"No, you., and pointed to one that took two items.  I found out what it wanted.  I don't remember the first, but breath was the second.  I gave it, and fell, weak.  The little statue guy came alive and defeated our enemy before crumbling and turning back to stone.  The danger was in how much you give.  The weakness, and would they give back?  Then my mother and maternal Grandma Jane took me for my driving test.  I had to take a permit test before the driving.  A lady held up a picture of a cow and a llama.  She mumbled out a question, and I was nervous and couldn't understand, so I didn't know how to answer.  I went and sat and waited with Grandma Jane, and came back to find I wouldn't even get to the driving portion.  I'd only gotten 87 on the first part.  That question.  I asked her about it.
