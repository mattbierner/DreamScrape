There is a boy sitting at a table with us. He's eating a huge bowl of fruit and ice cream, which came in rectangular chunks. Ned tells us to meet at 8:30 in Major Hall Dormitory."

Nan Lawson and his friend are there with my dad and Lisa, and they're all swimming. We park the car. By the time it's parked, they're done swimming and are walking up towards the cabin. My dad says jokingly, with his characteristic laugh, that he's sorry I didn't do as well as I wanted. He thinks I've already found out my grades, but I haven't. Then I realize the school has sent my grades home and my dad knows what I got. I ask him. He tells me I got 12 points, meaning 4 B's, with 3.0 grade points for each. I go nuts. I fall on the ground and swear and hit the grass with my fists. I'm pissed off. My friend Esther Thurman's car is there. I'm on the ground next to it. Esther and my friend Marybeth Neumann come to console me. Part of my anger is acting. My old basketball teammate Carl Everson is there. I ask him if he can relate to my dilemma, because he did really well in high school. He says that college is harder."

I tell him we need different colored lights: one red, one white, and one blue. He says he has something that will work. We put the boat in. Once it's in I'm having major trouble steering. I want to go backwards, but I can't control the motor. The boat keeps going in circles, and I get frustrated. The motor is still running, and I pick it up off the back of the boat. The prop is tilted so to propel the boat downwards. I go underwater. My clothes are heavy. I am wearing flippers, and still holding the motor. Something tells me to kick my feet and I will go the surface. I do, but I don't see the surface. I want to turn the motor to propel me up. I don't feel any panic. I may realize I'm dreaming, but nothing becomes of it."

We throw one at a kid. He tosses it inside a nearby building, through a little hole. It blows up, breaking down the wall of the building. Stephen and I go into a small door. The room we go into is large and bare. It's painted completely blue with rust patches all over. The room is then the top of a mushroom cloud water tower. Gino Teavor is there. There is a door on the other side of the room, straight across from the door we entered. I go to the far door and carefully peer out. It is a long way to the ground. I lay down and put my head out the doorway. There is another building with an old blue rusted top. I look out the other door. There is a police car below with its lights on. I look below my feet. There is a grate with rung steps going down the center of the water tower. Outside there is a rope going down the side of the tower. If I go outside the police might shoot me. So I take the grate off and start climbing down, going as fast as I can. I don't know if Stephen or Gino follow. When I get to the bottom of the tower, I fight with a fat police officer. I think the other officer is hurt. Stephen and Gino aren't there, or they are bystanders. I throw a hollow metal tube about 6 feet long at this officer. I miss. He throws it back, and I dodge it. He jumps up as I swing, and it goes under his feet."

It goes down over her hips. It looks like she is wearing only that. She asks grandma and grandpa to borrow a pair of pants, because she's cold.

I enter a door after I pass the Russian lady. I am in grandma Redding's old plant room. There is a kid there who plays soccer; Kevin Nielson I think, and I think he's drunk too. He tells me he saw me score a goal. I tell him I don't play soccer. We are down by the exit door to the plant room, and we go outside. There is a pack or bunch of wolf-like dogs outside. They start chasing Kevin. I yell at the dogs. They turn toward me and I run. I am ready to kick the dog coming directly towards me when it jumps at me, but it doesn't jump.

The greenhouse is about four feet deep, and there are wooden 2x4's supporting the grass above in various places. The spot that we fell through is a portion of this area.

I think we can take a shortcut by cutting across the Parts Company lot. The land there is hard and we can bike fast. I turn too soon, near the Roadside building, and have to go down a ways further. There are employees outside. When I get over by the Large Company, I find I'm in Golden Acres riding my old red Huffy bike with crooked handlebars. The neck of the bike is loose again. There are some soccer players kicking a ball around in their yard."

There is one kid, I think from Rival High School, who dunks easily. I should be able to also, but when I go up to dunk I just don't get high enough, and end up laying it in, or even missing the lay-up and going for the put-back.  I'm on an outside court, which is hard packed dirt. Someone has a long metal rod and they jab the dirt in one spot making it not-so-smooth. There are a number of groups of people there. Bud Slick, Donald Dilson, Daryl Yeller, and Simon Naver, people I know from high school, are each in a group. Donald Dilson's group is tracing the outline of a body on the dirt, which is then the Armstrong High School gym surface, using white chalk. There is a black man there with a cane, which is like a metal rod. He is hiding it down the leg of his pants. The national anthem is played. The game is USA versus Mexico. Mexico is a shorter and smaller team. I feel like the team I am playing for, the USA, will easily defeat Mexico."

I look up and see the moon in the sky next to the sun. They are about one thumb's width apart, I judge. There appears to be a \"bite\" taken out of each of them. I think this is weird because they are never that close to each other. There is an alien face to the left of the sun. It is black with white eyes and a white mouth. I wonder where this is coming from, and then I turn around and see that the sun is reflecting off the windshield and bumper of the car behind me back into the sky. Ahead of me and to my right is what looks like my friend Nate Nelling's car. I pass it. Then I am in the car, and am passing a semi-truck. I am nervous about being in such a little car. I make a turn on the road when going almost 60mph. I feel the car kind of shake. The sun is really bright as we round the curve. I drive into a small town. The speed limit sign says 49mph. The town is just like Oak Valley when you drive in on highway 23. There is a baseball field and an AAA store on the right. There is a Food-n-Fuel and a bar on the left. But the town has a newer, cleaner, smaller atmosphere to it. A lot of things are colored bright blue. I look for a sign that will point me in the direction of Hillston, because I think I've gotten a little off track. There is a road sign saying Dalz, which is the name of a town, is 31 miles, with an arrow pointing to the left. I turn left, but stop to check the road map in my back pocket."

I try not to look directly at her chest, but it is hard not to. She stands up and puts a big bra on.  We are now by the railroad tracks in Oak Valley, near 3rd Avenue, outside by a road playing cards. The police all and say they've been getting calls about gambling and card playing. Everyone starts to put the stuff away. I tell them to hold on, and I run across the tracks to a green house where the Teavor family lives. They have a phone on the outside of their garage near the door. I pick it up and call the police. An officer picks up the phone. I yell and sweat at the person. He yells back. I tell them it's my right guaranteed by the constitution to play cards if I want to. The officer brings up my past, asking if I've ever been stopped for speeding. It turns out that recently I had been going 26mph in a 25mph zone and the roads were icy. My car spun around. A cop stopped and questioned me. I hadn't been drinking. The cop kicked my car. The blackmails me into not pursuing the card playing issue because I was going over the speed limit and could have been given a ticket. I yell at the cop over the phone that this is blackmail! I was being harassed! I hang up the phone knowing the police are on their way. I tell everyone to leave their stuff and run. We do. My gradeschool classmate Sonya Nittles is there. She is running in the same direction as I. I go forwards to Carter School. She starts to follow me, then doesn't. That is good because it is easier for me to travel alone. I run towards the bowling alley. I'm wearing a life preserver (life jacket). I jump a fence and scrape my wrists a little bit. The cops are looking for me. I go into Billie's daycare to rest. I peer out onto Holy Avenue. Two police cars go through the intersection of Holy and 2nd Street. One of them turns and drives down Holy, towards where I am. I run inside and go into the women's bathroom. I take the garbage bag out of the trash can and throw the life jacket in, putting the bag back in place. The cop car is rolling slowly down Holy.

Prince either owns the club or is there. I go out of the club and see some neatly trimmed bushes. They have a reddish-purple veil covering them. One of the bushes looks like a big Afro. I pull this veil off the bushes and scrunch it up into a little ball about the size of a cantaloupe and put it to my nose, inhaling deeply. It smells a little bit like raspberries. It is the color of raspberry. It is Prince's veil.  I walk up a ramp to leave the club. Whitney Houston comes down with her entourage. She is playing the part from the movie \"Waiting to Exhale\", and I remember a radio announcer saying in the movie that she couldn't get a date, and indirectly pointing out it's quite a bit different in real life.  I am with three women. Two of them are black, and one is white. I may be the white woman. We are walking down a long cement ramp like the one at the Montana Zoo in the tropical garden section. We are all wearing nice dresses and holding umbrellas. About halfway down the ramp one of them women turns and goes into a building. The other two continue to the bottom of the ramp, where there are doors and a shopping mall. I am carrying my umbrella off my shoulder. The other woman and I go through the doors at the end of the ramp.  I am now with my friends Bubba Hacker and Kevin Simpson in the mall scene. Bubba tries to get into this JC Penny store. The door to the store won't open. I pull a latch on a sliding door next to the one Bubba tried, and we all open it. We walk in, and see that it is a storage area, maybe for overstock items. The room is large and mostly empty. There are a few pallets of dog food in big green bags, and Bubba says that what we have to do is load those on a truck. There is a forklift there. I think that since I have a little experience with a forklift I'll drive it. I get in the seat and realize that I'm sitting backwards, so I turn around. The forklift moves. I must have hit something inadvertently when I sat down. It rolls and falls off the loading dock, 5 or 6 feet down. We have no way of moving it, so I walk over to the power jack. I can't work the power jack because the buttons are different than what I'm used to. The jack goes in different directions that I intend. Then I get it to work adequately, and run the jack into a pallet so I can stack the other pallets on top of that one. There is no longer dog food on top of them. Bubba is down on the loading ramp. I realize I'm dreaming and say to Bubba, \"Bubba, I'm dreaming! This is your dream and I realize I'm dreaming in it!\" I decide not to change the dream, just to go with it.  Outside the loading dock is Grandpa Redding's farmyard. Kevin is running or driving something around. My truck is parked in the driveway, and there are people in it, lying in the back. Among them are my friends Carol Derth, Mya Rousing, and Nat Miller, and my cousin Anna Strange. They are cold, and I give them blankets. I tell them to take their clothes off and get next to each other to stay warm. One of the girls does. Grandpa asks me if the latches on the truck work okay. I say the tailgate is working fine. I think there is a bicycle or two in the back as well. There is a bunch of cane sighing poles in the back of a bluish-gray truck or van. They were from the group of people in my truck, who had gone fishing at Keeper Lake off the dock earlier in the day. The people in the back of my truck are saying that they're going to be cold on the ride home. I walk over to my mom's car. I think we are all driving home in it. Grandpa points out that the back tires are low. We're not all going to fit. Inside the porch, where the guns used to be kept, are two pairs of my basketball shoes: My new basketball shoes and my old white pair with the sides ripped out."

I go out to buy food and tickets. I put a laundry token in a water faucet to get water smelling like marijuana. I put the water in my backpack, and then use a glass that is in my pack to scoop out some of the water, which smells like marijuana.  The faucet won't shut off. I turn a soap-like knob, which doesn't work. Finally I get the water off. A fat man with a Local Casino t-shirt gives me a bunch of free movie tickets. He says the other night he won the most he's ever won there. I go back and the theatre is a television. The seats are couches. Kristy Puffy, Kevin Simpson, and Hannah Reed, who are friends from high school, are there. I got my marijuana (water?) but don't know how to smoke it, and can't find a place to sit and spend a lot of time getting it set up. The movie is dumb."

I see my mom. I'm embarrassed to be seen playing with two girls, but I go up to her and tell her that I'm leaving. It is icy outside. My sister Ramona just got her drivers permit, and I might let her drive, but there is something wrong with the car: it's locked. I unlock it. It's running. We need to back it out but it is too icy, so I have one of Ramona's friends push. Her friend is then in the driver's seat pushing back on the seat. I am in the back seat at the steering wheel. We start backing out. I yell at her to stop pushing. She doesn't, and I yell again. We are going to hit a car. I yell and finally she hears me. The car slides sideway and bumps a little red car, leaving a dent. There is a new blue truck there too, and I probably dented it, but I'm not taking responsibility for that; just for the red car. I find a police officer and tell him that I hit a car. He asks me if I admit it was my fault. I say yes. He tells me my insurance or I have to pay full damages. We are parked in a parking ramp, and I send someone to up to get my mom. People are eating this horrible-looking green pizza form Pizza Hut. There is a girl there that looks a lot like Nellie Hammer, and woman that sat in front of me in a geography class at Brimson. She is drunk and she hits on me. I get away from her: she is ugly.

My friend Stephen Ramos and three other guys get the bikes. Tony Ramada takes one. He rides it and then does a ghost-rider, letting it crash into a semi-truck. The semi drives over it and it remains unscathed.  I'm with Yvette Ullman. There is a bunch of us in a suburban-like vehicle. We're driving on Highway Q in Wilmerton, going south by the Holiday Inn. In the field on our right there is a truck of some sort driving over rough, snowy terrain. I say wow; it would be great to own one of those vehicles! Then I could drive it all over! I write the name of that truck out of the dust on the rear side window of the suburban.  Yvette has a bunch of eggs. At first I think they are caviar, but then I think they are human eggs! We are going to spread the eggs over some land. A person can eat the eggs, but one has to cook them 20 minutes. We go to a house, which is like Major Hall, another college dormitory. I am carrying Yvette's bike up the stairs on the 3rd floor. We get to the third floor. Kari Otis, a friend from grade school and high school, has a room there. I say hi to her. I steal a red jellybean from her. I guess it is Easter time.  I am going down the stairs, sliding on my stomach on a pillow. The stairs descend, then turn 180°, then descend, then turn, etc. At the first level down I find a Penthouse magazine. I want to take it. I'm about to shove it down my pants, when a girl looks up the stairs and sees me. I toss it aside, saying that I'm just joking. I go down another flight of stairs. Again there is a Penthouse. I want to take it, but there are people around. I go down a third flight, and find a third Penthouse. I don't get to take the Magazine. Brownie Bruny, a person I know from grade school that was a year older than I, is there at the bottom of the stairs. I have never liked her. There is a room there with a party atmosphere. People are dressed up. Brownie is wearing a wig and is as snobby as ever. My friend Simon Naver is lying on the floor. I can tell it's him by his pants. They are all leather and look like the leather jacket he has. I go over to him, he gets up, and we shake hands. We're happy to see each other. We shake hands again. I almost hug him but feel that would be inappropriate."

I'm waiting for Tina Totts, a friend from high school, who is meeting me. She is coming back from Big City, where she goes to school.  My sister Ramona and her friend Peggy Flowers come in. They are going to a movie across the street. They ask me about getting a ride home. My classmate Kelsey Bobber, the three Peppercorn sisters from Brimson, and my friend Gino Teavor walk by me. Gino is drunk, talking about driving in cold weather. At first I wondered if they would let me sit at the bar. Maybe my facial hair would make me look older."

I'm on the loveseat with Annie while Emily and Nate are on the floor. I'm sucking Annie's breasts and she's moaning loudly. She wants me to take off her pants, and she unbuttons them and pulls them down a little bit. I point to Emily and Nate and say to Annie, \"What about them?\" I don't really want to give Annie cunnilingus in front of them. I point upstairs and mouth the word \"upstairs\".  We go up into my old room. Annie sits on a bed, which is up against the slanted wall. There is a ladder there. She asks me if I still want to see her when we go away. I tell her, \"I don't not want to see you.\" She starts crying. I try to explain to her my thoughts about our different lives at college. There is music playing in the room. It is cheesy music from a pirate ship or a pirate ship movie. There is a looking glass in the floor, like those that would be on the bottom of a ship so one can look through the bottom. I walk around the ladder as I try to explain my feelings to Annie. I lean on it, and kind of hide behind it, but want to maintain eye contact with her. There is a rope-like electrical cord going across the floor.  Annie asks me to play some good music because the music we're listening to is crappy. I say I will, and apologize for not doing it sooner. I walk into my sister Ramona's bedroom and get a tape. There is a baby playing there that is a year or two old. It is all alone, and I think it's strange that no one is there to take care of it. I'm pretty sure it's not a child of one of my sister's or my mom. I grab a tape and start to walk out. I stop and look at the child, who has a cord or rope in both hands, like a ribbon. It makes an evil face at me, and I realize it's not a real baby. It is a sort of evil-something. I can see the evil in its eyes. I grab it by the arm and smash it against the wall repeatedly. I yell for Annie. She comes in, and upon seeing the child says, \"Oh, my God.\""

I get onto the bunk bed and look at the place where I have to go up. We have to remove a panel in the ceiling to get to the small ladder and door to the roof. We stand on a chair and climb up. There is no lock on the door. I push the door open and stick my head up. To my surprise, there are kids all around. It is their recess time. They are listening to a man talk. The man can't see my head because there is an enclosure around me open only on one side. The kids shift their attention from the man to me. I flee: down the ladder, out the door, and down the stairs. There are plastic eggs on each level as I go down. I pick up a few as I go. Whitey Tub, the vice-principle at my high school who once suspended me, is chasing me. He catches up with me or meets me near the ground. He accuses me of going on the roof, and I deny it. I tell him I was just walking down the stairs. I'm holding the eggs. Annie is with me."

We find one at a school, and she gets out to get cash.  Then I am driving with my mom. I'm telling her about my medicine that I take twice a day. It's getting dark. We drive by a huge company building. There are four or five huge garbage cans around the side of the building, built into the walls. There is a huge parking ramp in which our car is parked. My mom and I walk to the top level. It's late, most people have gone home, and the rest are leaving. Our car is parked right at the edge of the ramp, for which there are no walls, only metal cord going around the edge. I'm afraid we'll drive off the edge. The top of the ramp is covered with green plastic-like carpeting. My mom drives well, and we maneuver around a car and exit safely.  I'm in back of a house that feels like Sjogren's house, which I used to deliver papers to in Oak Valley. There is a rabbit wrapped up in a cocoon-like structure, like a white web. It comes out. At first, I think it's a deer; it's brown. Then I see it's a huge gray rabbit! It talks to me like it's a baby. It helps me put big chunks of split wood in a baler. It has a Christmas ball tied to its tail. It has a long nose and can stand on two feet. It balances a chunk of wood on its head. The rabbit is slow: I could follow it as it hops around lethargically."

Among the people there are my friends Thad Templeton, Stephen Ramos, Sam Kingsley, Annette Gollum, Melanie McDyss and my girlfriend Annie Thomas. A basketball teammate from high school, John Kulik, may also be there. A group of kids and their leader arrive. We are restricted to the deep end of the pool, then. Before we start up, we all gather around the side of the pool. There are bunk beds there. The kid whose bed I am sitting on is on vacation. My friend Tom Napper talks about how he has urinated while on a cordless phone. I laugh and say I've done that too. A man named Hal and his mother are there and they laugh at that comment.  Instead of real goals, there are two small rags on each side of the pool. IT looks like they are poked into cracks in the pool. I put a bunch of silver change in my pocket; dimes I think. I have the balls. Instead of real water polo balls, we are using three small yellow Velcro discs about the size of a penny. I have all three, and grip them in my left hand. I dive over the people in the pool and race towards the goal. I think I can catch them off guard and score. I make it to the other end. People are grabbing me and pushing me, trying to stop me from scoring. The goal is different now: it is an indentation in the side of the pool. One of the discs has to be put in it to score. I punch or thrust my arm and head into the opening with a maximum effort. People are on me. I think I score.  Then we are down by the other team's goal. One of the yellow discs has burst, and en eye came out of it. I give the disc and eye to Thad. I yell for Annette. I large woman and her clan of kids comes over. Her name is Annette too. I tell her no, that I meant Annette Gollum. A security guard then walks around the edge of the pool. He jumps in feet first, in full uniform. He surfaces a little later with a glass jar of pink grapefruit juice and something else. The lady Annette and the guard tell us of something that is in the pool, that has been lurking around. A person names Winston is in the pool, underwater. He is clothed, and upside down. He has blown out all his air. Kyle Rappaport is on the bottom of the pool, in the fetal position. Someone says something about this creature that is in the pool. I look down at Winston and Kyle and see that they are being held down by a black tentacle-like ribbon of flesh. The tentacles are coming out of a grate on the bottom of the pool. I realize Winston has been there for an hour and is dead, and that Kyle has been there 10 or 15 minutes and is probably dead too. Then the tentacles loosen. Their bodies begin to float up. I yell and run away. I know these people are dead. I stop and get some change from the bunk bed before I leave the area."

I go to the bathroom. I'm carrying a yellow tub of popcorn. There are some objects in the popcorn; snack pack pudding containers or clams. I go down a set of stairs to get to the bathroom. The stairs are wide. I see my friend's father Dilbert Simpson. He laughs at a story of me, something that happened a while back involving fish. We joke about the people serving fish one night at this weekend gathering we are going to. Dilbert says he wishes he could be in my group; be my group leader. I keep going to the bathroom. I cough up some phlegm. I go in the women's bathroom by mistake, and then go out. I have a bucket of scrambled eggs. I am trying to cross a swimming pool-like body of orange juice using a rope that is taut about 6 feet above the level of the surface. I spill some eggs, and end up gripping what's left of them in a baseball glove-like manner. My dad and my step mom Lisa are there. I think Lisa is saying something about not mixing the orange juice right: it being bad. I am trying not to touch the juice. I get close to the other side, but don't quite make it. The rope is cut and I fall into the juice. I am still hanging on to the rope trying to get out of the pool. The rope is then cut on the other side of the pool, and goes slack."

She gives me a t-shirt. It's for my sister, because tomorrow is her birthday. Nicole is very forward, while Persia is shyer. Persia comes over to the side of the bed and sits down behind Nicole. Nicole gets on top of me and leans over. Her thick hair falls in my face and we brush cheeks. I kiss the side of her face and her ear. Persia is next to Nicole. I lift my hand up and caress her cheek and lips. She kisses my hand, and licks it."

It stays very shallow. There are dog feces all over the lake bottom. I can see them in the water, which is 4-6 feet deep. I try to five with my mask. There is a skeleton of a small animal, a snake I think, and a turtle claw print in the sand. There is a live snake there. It is too shallow for diving. I want to get out to the boat."

I am going to shoot the people. I reach the top of the stairs and am going to shoot them but have no gun. I run and leap off the castle wall-like structure the men were sitting on. I fly. Looking down, it's thousands of feet to the ground. I'm really high up. The wind is strong. It gives me a bad feeling to fly over places like England, Japan, and Springfield. It is windy there.

I'm in a group of people. I see a meteor. Another person points it out too. It goes across the sky, which is a mixture of green and black. The sky becomes mostly green with a black shadow-like image of dangling spider-like legs. The black streaks contract. As they do the surface of the ocean breaks. I don't want to fall in. Other people do want to fall in. People want to go to Candyland, as it seems, which is a fun place, or so I hear. I don't want to go because I'll have to swim back. I fall into the water, which is very warm. It is sweet and thick, like chocolate. In this place everyone is playing a game. The goal of the game is to accumulate something, or some things, in a certain proportion. To begin, I run and climb up a series of air-filled plastic tube mountains. The area is wet, like a water park. I think I will do well. I beat the crowd up the structure and grab money and other items, including a checkbook and passport. The things I accumulate are money, power, and wealth. These clues are later no good. I clutch my hand full of paper bills and other wealth. My friend Bubba Hacker is chasing me. I run and jump off a tube structure, diving into the pool of water below. I over rotate in the dive and land on my back. Bubba follows me.  There are other ways to play the game; other things to do. I have a small plastic object that looks like a clear remote control. I'm trying to accumulate red or light purple dots on it. I do this by coming into contact with people who have red or light purple dots in their possession, since more than one person can share some clues. I succeed in getting some red dots. I get \"ambushed\" by people, including my brother Wally. We wrestle in the water for what I have in my hand. I think it is my checkbook. Normally in water, I am afraid of being pushed under. I really want the checkbook though, and go under the water and grab onto it with both hands. A man reads off the scores of the game for the first round. I didn't do well. My high school classmate George German did well. My family's friend Erika Hedgcock did well too.  As the man reads, I see Annie. We are walking by each other. I put my arm around her as we walk. She puts her arm around me. We walk up stairs, and she jokingly says to me that I better not flirt with the lady that is walking in front of us. I say yeah.  The second round starts. Immediately I pick up a bunch of different clues, including dice, figurines, a match stick-like structure, and small plastic animals that are size of a quarter. They act like keys, I think, and enable one to go further into a particular area. I think maybe I should have just gotten one or two clues in some area. I go into a place of lodging. It is fake; made up for the game. It's a sort of primitive house. I am going to make porridge. I'm alone, and don't really know what to do. My high school classmate Nathan Plumber and my junior high social studies teacher Gary Lashing are there. Another kid starts to make a fire. He needs a clue. I have it; it is the matchstick. It is cracked, but I try it anyway. I light the match and try to light a bigger object using it."

I'm with another person, but I do most of the fighting. I kill the ghost of Carl Gustav Jung, and then the other ghosts. A truck is buried in golf balls. The hood of the truck is open. There is a big round circle of metal in the center where the engine would be. Golf balls, each one coming from or actually being a famous dead person, like the ghosts, roll towards the hole in the metal. Even if they don't go exactly in the hole, if they get close that is good enough, and they have made it."

I get it from Tiny and give it to them. I try to find a pan for us to use to cook macaroni. I am at my house. My sister Ramona and brother Wally are there with me.

My friend Kevin Simpson and I are there already. The ending point of the funeral is a parking lot in which there are many poles sticking up to mark off the lanes for traffic. We see a monster truck with huge tires. The tires have weird tread, like a saw blade. Then we see the hearse pull into the lot. It is like a battering ram, tough and square looking. Kevin says he'd like to have a hearse names after him.  In a building, we're in an empty room. Kevin and Mark are there with a woman from my neighborhood. They talk about suicide. They all have scars. Mark talks about cutting the veins on the inside of his leg near his groin. They are back from the dead for one year, but only if their spouse had approved. Mark talks more about cutting himself: how and where. The neighbor woman is topless. She has a scar from shoulder to shoulder across her chest, and two scars down each upper pectoral muscle. I don't want to look at the scars. Kevin and Mark and I are in the corner of the room. There are blinds near us, almost wrapping around us. I reach my arms around both of them at the same time and grab the blinds. I hold them very tightly, and tell them what I think of suicide. I tell them that I think it's a cop out. That it is the easy way out and it is inconsiderate: the people that love you will really be hurt. Then I walk away. I talk to my dad. Looking over in the corner, I see that there are two straight bodies laying separately on the cement floor. I go to say goodbye to Mark. The two are standing. I don't' know what to say to Mark. We hug and cry. It's hard to keep my balance. We hug for a long time. There is violin music playing in the background. The hug is very therapeutic.

            "content": "Driving With Tom and Virginia  I'm driving a car with my friend Virginia Green's house. With me are Virginia and my classmate Tom Dement. I talk to Tom about college, saying he must be leaving pretty soon. He says he leaves tomorrow. I ask him if he is packed yet. He says no. We are going down the street near my dad's old little house, parallel to the railroad tracks. We are going east, towards Friends Avenue. Near the trucking barns, there is a reddish or pink car. It looks like it was assembled by hand using parts from different cars. It is made of steel. I turn right onto a road and go down towards Virginia's house. I park the vehicle, which is a red Volkswagen Bus, on the sidewalk in front of her house. We get out. It is cold and raining. Virginia's father is standing out in the yard. He is clean-shaven and his short, dark hair is combed. Her sister is in the hot tub in the back yard. I think of how I got sick from being in a hot tub in the back yard. I walk from the front of the house to the side door, going by the bushes and shrubs. I think of asking Virginia when her birthday is. Then I remember it is during the school year, in the spring. Now, it is summer. I walk into the side door of the house and go through the kitchen. In the living room are my friend Emily Zates and her younger sister Audrey. Emily hopefully asks me if I brought any board games. I didn't. There is another girl with them. She has five beers. I find a rubber gun that shoots ping-pong balls. The girl I don't know and I shoot balls at each other, flirtingly. I say to her that five beers are enough for her because she is so small.  There is a party at Virginia's house. There are mostly guys there: jocks from high school. My friend Lyle Zeffman is there. Another kid is there who looks younger. He weighs a lot. Lyle has taken this kid's shirt and is teasing him. The kid is embarrassed. He has a diaper-like white cloth or bag tucked into the side/rear of his pants, which are pulled up really high. The kid has butt-white skin; pale. There is a phone call. It is my friend Jimmy Youngman in Colorado calling. I talk to him a little bit. I talk like he is my friend Jack Miller, and I recall the time when Jack caught a big rainbow trout when we were fishing. I tell him that my friend Kevin Simpson and I went out this year a few times fishing for trout and didn't catch any. I finally say, \"Jimmy, I don't know what to say.\"  Virginia is upset because her party isn't turning out well. So far, it is a bunch of jocks making fun of each other. I go out to the porch. The porch gives me the feeling that I am in Clarence Bahe's house, which is where I used to deliver papers. There are people in the back yard. My friend Kathy Branch is on the porch with me. She is smoking a cigarette. I say to her, \"Looks like you picked up a nasty habit at school.\" She says that she doesn't like the taste of it. Her cigarette is huge. When the outside of it burns away, there is an inside \"core\" to it. My friend Stephen Ramos and his work friend Izzy drive by in Stephen's brown car. I run out onto the street yelling and jumping up and down. They turn around and come back. A turquoise station wagon pulls up. In it are my friends Kevin Simpson, Stephen, and Sam Kingsley. I greet them with some funky hand slapping, like on the Fresh Prince of Bel Air. There is a guy there with long dark hair dressed in clothes from the 1970's. Kevin has a big wooden cross, which is a horse or a boat to him. He also has an oar. He is pretending to be an adventurer and he puts on a show, jumping over a car and speaking lines from movies with a Scottish accent. My friend Persia Miko is outside with other people and they watch. I laugh. It's good to be with the guys again."

People brace themselves by putting one leg in front of the seat and one in back of it. I sit normal, with both my legs in front of the seat. There is a problem with the movie screen. People are supposed to try to climb the curtain around the screen using the knuckles of their index and pinky fingers. I try it. The curtain and screen break and fall down. We can see outside, because the curtain isn't there. We wait for the people to fix the curtain. The Allure family is there. I am sitting down next to the screen. Harmony Allure comes and sits by me. I say to her sarcastically that she must be pretty desperate to sit by me. She sarcastically replies, \"Yeah.\" The movie starts again. We all leave because we don't want to watch it. We go outside. Tom Allure yells at a man driving a truck because the man is scratching the sides of the truck. The sky is black with clouds. There are brilliant light cracks in the clouds that are golden-silver in color. We go to the side of a building where there is a big chalkboard. People paint on it. I talk with Harmony about school. She tells me about how bad her football and German classes were. I tell her I would drop a bad class."

I pull the boat into the water, rather than backing it in. I'm not sure which vehicle I'm driving. There is a tree in the way, so I decide to back the boat in. When we put the boat in, the landing is filled with huge rocks. My mom wants to be back by 6:00 am so I figure we have a good two hours to fish. I go and park the trailer. I drive down the road a ways and find a driveway I can turn around in. I think that the mosquitoes probably won't be bad because of something, but it is evening so they'll be worse than usual. We lift the boat in, scraping it on the rocks. The anchor is hanging out. There is a dammed up stream leading out to the river that we travel in before getting to bay on the river. It is like we are portaging. There are broken oars all along the river and in the dam. I step on the dam-made of intertwined sticks and leaves and oars-to pull the boat through. There are many boats out in the bay. It is packed. There is good smallmouth bass fishing. We travel out of the stream. There is a man driving a nice boat with a trolling motor on it, going the opposite way. . There is an office in the bay. I am in it with three other men. They are doing something corrupt. Two of the men leave. I talk with the third man. A truck pulls up. I am not in the office now. A woman in the truck has her boy get out and run something important into the office. I hide and try to watch the boy.  I'm in my mom's bedroom at home looking out the window to where I think the boy will be. I am going to climb out and intercept the boy. I have my leather jacket on.

I say that it too bad about grandma Karla. I am upstairs in the cafeteria now. There are escalators instead of stairs. I am at the top of the escalator. There is a long line to get food. The big football player who looks like my supervisor from Grocery Getto, Loren Voigt, says something to me about going to the back of the line. I say shit, I don't want to wait! I put my hand on the railing of the escalator and hit an alarm. A buzzing bell goes off. The food server man goes to the panel in the wall with four handles on it. She shuts the alarm off, and then turns on a control alarm. Then he shuts the control alarm off. He turns to the people in line and asks who hit the alarm button. I say it was I: I hit it accidentally, and I'm sorry. He tells me that I'll have to wash the dishes in the cafeteria on the weekend. I tell him I don't even work in Mason! He doesn't care. He gets mad and squirts me with some Palmolive dishwashing soap. I go down the escalator. At the bottom are two Brimson security guards. They are talking. One is holding deodorant. I tell them I have been verbally harassed and assaulted. I ask them what my options are, concerning what to do now. The director of Mason Cafeteria is talking with the guards. I see someone above me run towards where the incident took place. The person running is a black leader. My friend Queen Billman is there. She was with when the alarm went off. She whispers to me that we should just leave. I don't respond to her. I want to be vindicated. It is concluded that the man who squirted me will do the dishes. I explain that he threatened us by telling us we would have to wash dishes. This person is there. He looks different: he has long dark hair, and is not wearing a bandana. He is wearing an apron and his shirt is wet. Queen was also squirted. We leave. I think I'll eat somewhere else tonight. Queen runs and grabs some fruit snacks in a purple package that are on the table of a booth. She hops on a skateboard and skates to her room. I wonder if she is coming back. It seems like it.

She has trouble closing it. I show her how. It is mostly just pulling the door really hard. There is a girl in the garage that is having trouble closing the door there. The door to the garage from the kitchen is open. The garage light is on. I see a young woman with a long pole in the garage. She is pointing the pole at the door that goes from the garage to the driveway."

My feet and legs are resting on Madonna, and my head is resting on Niles. I am grabbing Ben's breast, which is larger, like a woman's breast. Dennis Rodman is on television. He is naked. His penis is more than a foot long, and it is limp. Madonna talks about Dennis Rodman's penis. Niles leaves. Madonna and I start to get it on. She is masturbating. I give her cunnilingus, and rub her clitoris with my finger. We kiss. We are clothed, and then are naked. She is going to perform fellatio on me, but I give her cunnilingus again instead. My sister Ramona, who was gone with my mom, comes into the room. She has a sheet of paper with a lot of caricatures on it. There are some sketches of her and of I. Madonna and I leave to get privacy. I say to Madonna that we can go to my room, and that she can stay the night. We are on the stairway. She says we can go to her house, which is 30 minutes away. We decide to go. I grab my jacket and my dream journal. My family knows I am going to Madonna's house for the night. It's winter outside. I go out the door. There is a limousine. I am headed for the back seat, when the driver gets out and tells me to drive. I say okay, and get in. I am sitting on a seat, and there is a bucket seat between the steering wheel and I. The limo driver gives me directions. I turn around near the Roman's house on Home Avenue, and go north on Home Avenue, past my house. My mom is on the side of the road. I slow down, but when I hear her saying that she doesn't think it's a good idea that I go, I speed away. My sister Ramona is venturing out in the street in front of me waving her arms. She doesn't think it's a good idea for me to go, either. I speed up and she has to dodge the limousine to avoid being hit.  At Madonna's house, I am playing a large game of golf and some other mystery game. There are two other guys with me. I go to hole number two. I have to climb down a rocky cliff-like formation. The hole is 581 yards long. There is an island where one has to chip the ball up onto a ridge. There is a huge fossil of a fish, about 20 or 30 feet long, at the beginning of this hole in the rock formation. I am looking at another area: how to play that hole. It is rock, but then it turns into a building. I realize that Madonna isn't real: she is fake. It was all a set up to lure people somewhere (here?). There are strong machine-like men there. They have some power. I try to hurt them, but I can't. They hurt me. There is a group of people there, including my friend Beth Mock. We keep the men from coming in through the doorways. There is a cage-like structure with electric chairs in it. A lady tells a story. The people in the cage are set free. I go in. There is an attractive woman in the cage. We introduce ourselves. Her name is Steph. She gets nervous and wants to get out of the cage. We discover there is a fake serum. The serum allows us to beat the men. A kid fakes craziness, and is able to kill one of the men by stabbing him in the throat. I get into the room where they make the serum, though I don't find any of it."

I use a very old computer, like the ones in the basement of Billings Hall at Brimson. It is difficult to access the email. When I get into the network, I have five new messages, which surprises me because I checked my email earlier in the day. I don't recognize who they messages are from, on the directory. The first message is from my friend from high school Simon Naver. The message has weird graphics, including circles and spirals, and color. There is a place on the screen that says, \"touch screen here\", surrounded by colorful spirals. I touch the screen on that spot. The screen becomes full of action. It displays two people playing racquetball from the point of view of the top of the front wall of a racquetball court. It is in computer graphics. I think this is a neat new kind of email that Simon used. One of the girls I was with walks by. I show her the neat email message. She says that is neat.

I say, \"Do me a favor\" twice while speaking to her. I climb up the rocks with running water on top of them. I get cut up and am bleeding. I get to the top of the rocks, all cut up. Annie is then my old roommate's girlfriend Natasha Lens. We hug each other very firmly. I cry very hard. It is sad, and I feel hurt. I kiss her, and we kiss. Our interactions start to become sexual. She is rubbing her body up against mine. She goes down to give me fellatio. I pull off her pants and roll over. We are in position \"69\", where I am on top of her with my head between her legs. She says something about who will orgasm first, and also says something about me squishing her kidneys. I am then giving her cunnilingus. Below her pubic hair her vagina is very smooth. I use one finger to penetrate her vagina. She has an orgasm. After she climaxes, I lick her vagina all over. She is then my friend Norman Noman, from Brimson."

The water is really deep. I want to jump in, but I don't want to be wet later. My friend's father, Dilbert Simpson, is there. My dad hooks a fish. He has super strong line on his reel, and the line will not break. It is a northern pike. At first I think it is a Walleye. I net the fish right before it spits out the lure, which is a Red Eye Wiggler. My dad wants to keep the fish to eat for dinner. The fish are all over in the water; pike are everywhere. We can see them in the water. I really want to fish! My high school friend Daryl Yeller and his brother go by, like they are on a river. I say hi."

I get to the bottom of the hill. Touse's don't live there anymore. There is the frame of a house, but no actual house. There is a lake with big rocks there. It is a very \"Montana\" feeling.

After I am finished yelling at them, I tell them to get out! Fran doesn't go out. I pick her up as if she is light as a feather, and march her outside. The others go out.

The cash register broke and the lights went out. Money was stolen. People came back at 3:00 am to get the money. Matt had waited for them, but had not waited long enough. Matt and I are near the American Legion building in Oak Valley. He puts some videos from Hollywood Video, and I put some strips of my stratographic column from Historical Geology, into a manhole cover.  I am in a bedroom with my friend Melanie McDyss. We are each in a single bed on opposite sides of the room. My stratographic column is in a shoebox with a slit cut in the top of the box. I need to get the column out and cut it up according to each formation, leaving two inches between each section. I take them out of the box and start cutting. There are two windows by my bed, which is in a corner of the room. One window is at the head of the bed, and I pull that shade down. The other window is left side of the bed, and it has no shade. There is another bed in the room. In the bed are my dad, sister Heather, and another person, who may be my brother Wally. They have sex. My dad is behind someone having anal intercourse with them. Someone defecates. When they do, I have the feces in a light brown, brimmed, safari-type hat. The hat is upside down and the feces are in the bowl portion of the hat. I run to the bathroom and take the feces out of the hat and put them in the toilet. The water in the toilet is tainted yellow from urine. I rinse the feces off my fingers in the toilet. Then I rinse my fingers in some water that is left in the bottom of a shower stall. I realize that some feces came out of my penis when I was masturbating. I hope Melanie didn't see this. When I am in the bathroom, I notice my skin is really dry, and has white patches on it. I put water on my skin and the white patches go away. I go back to bed. It is 11:10 on one clock, and 11:11 on the other. I see a man from my bed. The scene seems to be at home in Oak Valley. I see him sitting at the kitchen table as I look down the stairs. I see that he is the man from my Astronomy class that always drinks Arizona Tea. His name may be Damien. He is arriving home. It is as if he is my brother Wally. He goes to the basement. I am in my sister Ramona's room. Melanie gets up and goes to the storage closet in the room to urinate. I am awake, and I see her. She doesn't see me. She has a big bag packed for her trip to Chicago. She curses the big bag. It is on her back as she moves, making her clumsy. In the bedroom is a van that I put on the floor by my bed. There is a room with many nice glasses in it. All of these except one or two get broken."

I am driving a really nice truck, towing my boat behind it. It is early in the morning. I go around back of the shack and climb up on the roof. My dad goes by on the road between the hill and the old Simon's Grocery Store. He is driving his red Ford LTD Crown Victoria, and pulling a boat. I see him. He doesn't see me. He knew I was going fishing, but I didn't know he was. He sees my boat and the truck. He thinks this is odd because I usually leave the trailer at home. I go back to the truck and check the electrical connection between the truck and trailer. The connection is as big as a fist. The boat lights don't work. I drive down the hill, though I have no brake lights. I go into Simon's Grocery Store parking lot. I drive between two cement pillars in the parking lot. It seems like I am not in a truck, but on a bicycle. There is a lady in the parking lot taking down cornstalks from the previous day's festivities. The lady says I'll be insured, I just have to tell the insurance company. I drive away. I see a car driving down a road. The hood of the car is open a few inches. Black smoke and flames are pouring out from the windows and under the hood. There are two people in the car. I think the car is going to crash into two cars that are stopped at a red light. I think that seeing this is the kind of crazy, funny story to tell my friends Stephen Ramos and Kevin Simpson. The car stops, and a man gets out. He is on fire! He is calm. I see nothing that indicates that the flames affect him. The man is wearing sunglasses, and kind of old and dirty denim clothes. He has short curly brown hair. I stop and get off the bicycle that I am then on. He crosses the road and comes up to my home in Oak Valley, slowly and calmly, while on fire. He goes to the front door and enters without knocking. I realize what he is going to do: he is going to hurt my mom or my sister Ramona. I race across the road from the parking lot to the house. I go in the garage, where the big old garage door was. There are a bunch of knives near the door; they are like the kitchen knives we have at home, but are two or three feet long. I grab a knife. I rush into the dining room.

I see my friend Stephen Ramos at a table that seems pretty full. As I enter the place, my high school basketball teammate John Kulik walks out. I say hi. There is a lot of food on the tables: salads and other dishes. I sit with some men who are unfamiliar to me. They are in their early 30's, and seem like dorks. One of them is like Tom Ziegler, but rounder. One of them says he put an Ice House beer in the punch bowl to get the punch cold. I see the beer. I think my friend Nate Nelling may be there. I eat quickly, and drink lemonade. I say that I'm very hungry, but then I stop eating. I see two guys who I think are my cousins, Henry and Avery King. Then I realize that these are my friends Niles and Tim Zelling. There are some young women there who are part of the Jewish community. They dance down the long rows of tables. Everyone claps as the girls pass. Some people give a standing ovation. People sit on the floor behind their chairs as the girls dance. The girls dance between the person and the chair. They do this to me, and I move out into the aisle a little bit. I'm one of the only people sitting on my side of the table. There is a very long row of tables. One side of the tables is filled with people, and one side is sparsely populated. My friend Yvette Ullman is one of the dancers in the next aisle. I stare at her to make eye contact. She looks and sees me while she is dancing, but doesn't give me her characteristic smile. My dad is there, and he is now leaving. I walk with him to the back of the building, which is now a church. We talk about when we'll see each other next. He is coming through town next weekend. I tell him I have a lot of work to do, so Friday between noon and 2 p.m. would be good. Otherwise, we'll have to just get together really quick, because I need the other time to work. As my dad exits the church, my classmate Robyn Masters enters, and I hold the door for her. I feel dumb saying to my dad that I don't have a lot of time to visit, while Robyn is there.  I go back inside the church. I start to walk up to the front of the church and I hear a voice that says, \"Kenneth, there's a service going on here!\" I quickly turn around and walk out, apologizing. The woman who spoke is sitting on the end of a pew, dressed in blue with brown hair. She kind of reminds me of my ex-girlfriend's mother, Tamara Thomas, but also of all the other \"respectable\" women that haven't liked me and have reprimanded and embarrassed me. I walk out of the building with a classmate named Keith and another guy. We go to Keith's car. On the way to the car, we climb up a very steep bank covered in thick grass, to get to the parking lot. I am then crawling on the hood of the car, gripping where the hood meets the windshield. Keith is in the back seat, and then he opens the driver's door. I say that I'll drive, but as Keith gets into the driver's seat, I say that I'd better not drive, because I might crash his father's nice car. There is a box of Marlboro cigarettes under the radio. We start to drive. I'm in the front seat. Keith takes out a package of vitamin C drops and opens it. They are yellow and orange, and are the consistency of Pepto Bismol. The two guys I am with say these drops put them to sleep after a big meal. The Shabbat was in the church basement. It is dark and snow is on the ground. A man on a bike with two small children on the bike is riding towards us. Keith isn't looking. I yell at him to swerve. The man swerves to his left, while we swerve to our right. We are pulling a boat or a trailer. I don't think we hit the man, but the car behind us did. The man and the kids fly ahead of us. We stop. I run out ahead of the others. I go to the man. He is a person I know from Brimson names James Vegas. He says, \"Just give me the bill now!\" He is hurt and angry. I tell him not to move. \"The more you move now, the more pain you will be in later\", I tell him. I yell to a lady at a nearby house to dial 911. I take off my jacket and put it on James. I tell the others to do the same. They do. We put their jackets on the children, who are babies. One is an infant with a cone-shaped top of its head. The infant has some red scrapes on its head."

I say to Jack and Larry, \"I've never done drugs in my life, never had butt sex, and don't have AIDS, and if you think I do you can kiss my ass.\" Then I walk away. I'm on roller skates.

I'm in a small round two-person dome tent. I do something with the sides and door flaps in an attempt to make the tent roomier. I set up things in the tent for Ivory and I. I have tissues and other items because I think we are going to, and want to, have sex. The tent is crowded. There is a rain fly on the tent. Two sleeping bags are on the floor. Ivory doesn't sleep there. She sleeps in my mom's bedroom.  We are on an island/mountain area. I go and explore. I find a crack in the side of a rock that leads to a cave. There is a lake or river right near the cave. The cave is on the edge of an island, like on Jap Lake. There is a white dock and a white airplane across from the island on the shore. The plane might be taking off. The dock seems to break in half, and form a \"v\". There are coins in and around the crack and cave. There are a lot of old pennies from the 1900's. I find a 1920D penny. There are others that are very old, and that I think are valuable.  I go back to the others. Ivory is wearing a black bra and underwear in my mom's room. I jokingly say to her that I \"wanted to rape you\", but you weren't sleeping in the tent. There is a set of keys that are Ivory's. I put them on my key chain lock so we don't lose them. I go back to the cave with Hank, Fran, Anita, and Ivory. Our group has two flashlights. It is dark. We go through my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard. The cave is near the bushes in the front of his yard, next to the gray house that is just to the west of his yard. Alvin is in the basement doing laundry. There may be another man there. I have trouble finding the site at first, because I look too far west of where it actually is. I move along the rocky cliff and find the crack and the cave. Everyone is excited. Next to the cave is a man-made hollow cavern with wooden walls. It is a shop, a cover-up for something. Something is going on in this location. A bridge is needed to access that place. There are bad guys coming with a bridge. I start walking towards Main Street on Hill Avenue. I whisper for my friend Jill Banks to come to, and she does. We evade the bad guys. We walk on the sidewalk up to my neighbor Greg Olson's steps. We then go up his steps and sidewalk to his front door, and then jump off the steps at his door to the right and run around the house. We run in back of the house and go back towards Alvin Broud's house.  There are four men on Hill Avenue smashing a car. They seem to be yuppies. We are then back at Alvin's yard with the others.

A person I have met before, David Brice, is among the bad men. I hit him in the face with a wrench. There is an older man there, who is about 40 years old. I have the yellow plastic bat that my roommate Stephen Ramos keeps under his bed. There is another man there who has a bat. We beat the older man. I hit the man twice in the face, back, and groin. My bat is plastic, but the other man's bat is metal."

Tom is struggling to get comfortable on the floor. There is a noise. No one else is concerned about the noise. I go to see what it is. I walk up the stairs. There are two small children, about 4 or 5 years old. One of them is a girl. They have just come in the door. There is a knock at the door. A man with a gun comes in. I am going to ambush the man, but he goes downstairs towards my friends. I get the kids out the door and yell at them to run. We run to the neighbor's house. The girl falls. I go back and pick her up. The man with the gun is dangerous.

I quit playing the game because I have too much to complete before I would obtain the key.  I am a police officer. My brother Wally is released from jail. He is a prisoner. We walk around the police station. He has both hands grabbing onto my arms. I have both hands grabbing onto his wrists. I maintain physical control of him. There is a laser scanner upstairs. A man and a woman I know, and a man I don't know, come to the scanner where Wally and I are. The man sits on the scanner, blocking the laser. Wally and I go downstairs. We pass my friend Carmen allure and her father Tom. I say, \"Have a good weekend\" to them. Wally is like the cardboard box bailing man at Mason Cafeteria. I have fired him for the weekend. We're in an entry to Mason. He is upset that he has been fired, even though he doesn't like to work on the weekend. I get his jacket."

We are down by his brother Jose's deer stand. We see a huge black bear. We slowly walk backwards. The huge bear wanders away. I see two more black bears. They are smaller than the first, but still big. Then there are many bears all over the place. Stephen and I each have a shotgun with slugs. Stephen puts on a bear mask. It looks like the real head of a bear. The bears come near to me. I shoot three of the bears in the head: Jake and two other bears. Another bear, which is my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer, is upon me, and I am out of slugs. I awake from this dream, and don't have my dream journal. Stephen tells me I should have defecated before I went to bed because I was farting in my sleep. I know this isn't possible, but don't say anything to him. We are at our deer-hunting campsite. Jose and Franco Ramos are there too. I look out the door of our tent and see two hunters walking down the path along the fence towards Jose's deer stand. It is getting light outside. I realize we have overslept and are losing valuable hunting time. I get up. I have my Washington University pajama pants on. I go out of the tent. There are two men on the edge of our camp. They are on the edge of the woods. Our camp seems to be between the house and the woods, just south of the house. The men see a buck, and we see it too. It is close to camp, and we are in the line of fire for these men, so we move. The men scare the buck by throwing a flaming piece of two by four wood at it and firing a shot in front of it. The deer runs. Everyone fires at the deer, including Jose. At first, it looks like Jose is using a handgun. The deer escapes unscathed. It runs into the field. People fired shots to make it run in a certain direction, so they could shoot it. I am looking for my bag of clothes. I can't find it."

I think of shooting to make the deer run directly towards me, but I don't. I do fire, and I hit the deer. It is a big deer: it looks like a horse! It has six or eight antler tines. It runs into a nearby wooded and field area and falls down. I'm with my hunting party looking for the deer. We're in a house. It is pouring rain outside, really hard. Out in the field I see a lightning rod that is being continuously struck with lighting. People had just put the rod up early in the day. People also put blaze orange panels on the roof of a house, like insulation. I go into a small room, which is empty, dirty, wet, and tan in color. My party and I walk through a hunting camp while looking for our deer. There are two guys hunting, but not for deer. They point us to our deer, which is about 100 feet in a different direction. We see it, and go get it. Most of the deer's antlers have fallen off. It has only two big tines remaining, like an antelope. I think it must not be the one that I shot because that deer had a big six or eight point rack. My hunting partner Jose Ramos says the rack on the deer I shot was bigger than six or eight points. There are pieces of bone and antler on the ground from where the deer fell and hit the ground. The pieces are cracked and broken. The pieces look eroded, and have holes in them. I talk with Franco Ramos, another hunting partner, who says he could have hit that deer. I tell him he couldn't have hit the deer from where he was, on the edge of the field near the other woods. I show him where his shot ended up and where mine did, which is about 50 yards apart. His shot would have had to been about 200 yards. He accepts that I was the one who hit the deer."

I walk around an upper level of the concert looking down at the people on the floor. A lot of people are shirtless. It is daytime, I think, but I imagine a spotlight roaming the crowd and people going crazy when it hits them. I imagine myself when the spotlight hits me. There is a kid on the crowd bodysurfing. He is shirtless, but he is wearing a light blue shirt with the word \"spooner\" on the front of the shirt. I walk by a bunch of buses to find the bus I was on.

A kid on the bus yells at me about the underwear. One bus I pass has a fire pole to slide down as an exit. Finally I get to my bus. It is turquoise and has dark seats and tinted windows.

I take my pair of black underwear and try to put them on. I spin them on my finger for a bit, twirling them. I get them on, and go back to the man for my other clothes. The man is about to sell my clothes. I quickly say that I'll give him money, but then I beat him, kicking him in the groin and taking my clothes. From then on, he is younger, and he is after me for revenge. I leave. I am with the group of students that are in my traveling class. We go to a place numbered 50 on a city map. The man I beat up is still pursuing me. Outside the airport is a scruffy young man. He asks me, \"Would you care for psychology?\" He has a thick accent. At first I don't understand him. Then I realize he wants to talk about psychology, and I say yes.  I am in a mall-like area. There is a place called The Cosmopolitan, which is a small shop. It is early in the morning, and the shop is only serving beverages. My friend Yvette Ullman is there. I walk through the mall area and go into a bookstore. I walk around the counter and look at two men my age working there. I stare them down, comparing myself to them. I go look at some out of date Christmas cards and calendars, even though they are out of date. I walk in the mall, and see my old roommate Jens Nils. I say hi to him unenthusiastically. He and a group of three or four people are wearing colorful body garbs that come from a year-round Halloween shop in the mall. I see my high school classmate Brett Ball and say an unenthusiastic \"hi\". There is a display case in the mall with a few Darryl Strawberry baseball cards in it. There is nothing else in the case. There is a card that used to be of great value. It was priced at $9.75 now. The man working said he would have to check to make sure that the card is really that cheap.  I'm in a house or room with my mom and my sisters Heather and Ramona. I am eating broccoli. The broccoli is disgusting and I spit it out. My mom asks why I spit it out, and I say I hate raw broccoli. There are vegetable dips there. I have a slice of flabby broccoli, like a thick broccoli fillet. I don't eat it. My mom points out that there are carrots, and I eat those. A kid drives by in a truck. He honks and waves his hands out the window trying to get one of my sister's attentions. My sisters and I talk about some young kid. I tell him where I saw him last, but I forget the name of the place. I start saying what I think the name sounds like, and eventually one of my sisters guesses the name \"Cosmopolitan\", which I remember to be correct. A male police officer brings three young boys to the back door of our house. I meet them as I go out. The officer says to me that these three boys told him that I've been farting in places like basketball practice, or basketball games, which is a crime. I speak to the three boys and say that's right: I have been farting. I say there is nothing wrong with farting: it is an entirely natural thing. They disprove of my viewpoint, because of socialization. The officer lets me continue speaking. I speak until I am finished, and then go back inside. The officer doesn't stop me because I have argued my point well. I get inside and see my friend Esther Thurman and my old girlfriend Annie Thomas. I am surprised! I am slightly angry that the police officer bothered me. Esther tries to grab my hand a couple times, but I pull it away. I do this both because I am angry with the officer, and because Annie is there. Annie is wearing tight brown pants and big brown leather hiking boots. One of them is wearing a big puffy yellow jacket.  I'm in bed at the Manhatten Hotel in Sydney, Australia. I've told my roommate Niles Zelling the part of this dream where the man asks me, \"Would you care for psychology?\" Niles comes over and sits on my bed. He is excited. He knows what this part of my dream means. I think about it, and realize its meaning, and tell him it confirms my decision to major in psychology. He says I am exactly right. Then he looks ahead to our future plans of our \"dream machine\". He recalls our dream interpretation group in personality class, in which He says I did a good job, though I know I didn't."

I shake his hand to make amends. My mom is there. I look into the gymnasium. The game is a rout: Armstrong is winning 25-2. It is the end of the first quarter. There is 1:02 left in the first quarter break. The team is warming up. My dad is out on the court with them. He is goofing off: tossing a ball between his legs and demonstrating a hook shot. There is a bridge-like walkway over the court about 30 feet high. I walk up and across it. The band members are playing on the walkway. My dad is talking with the players, making fun of them. I am very mad that my dad has been doing all this with the players. I yell at him and tell him that he's hurting the players. He does his goofy smile/grin and chuckles, not taking me seriously. I am very mad at him. I tell him, using the words \"big man\" and \"little man\", that whenever we converse and I want him to take me seriously, he doesn't. When he wants me to take him seriously, I do. \"Big man\" is the one who wants to be serious. \"Little man\" is the one who won't be serious. Coach Jackson Shooter comes up to me and says, \"Stop yelling at your dad and help Ben\". He is annoyed with my behavior, and thinks I am being selfish. He thinks I'm being selfish. I say to my dad again, \"You're hurting the players.\" One of the players, Travis Kulik, is sick. A player who may be Andy Klien, but who has more facial hair, walks by. He does a handshake with my dad. Another player, Ryan Barnes, is there in street clothes."

I sarcastically say to her, \"Have a nice day.\"  I am skateboarding with two other people: one man and one woman. It is nighttime. We go fast, on Oak Avenue. There are no cars on the road. I go through the intersection of Oak Avenue and Main Street. I then turn back through the parking lot at Applebees, pulling myself along by grabbing onto poles and stationary items on Main Street. I go fast. The man with me can really go fast. I end up by the house of a man I used to deliver newspapers to, Mike Cherry. I am over near the railroad tracks then. I go to cross a bridge over the tracks, which isn't there. I crash, and land in some flower bushes, partially crushing them. I run to my neighbors the Dinks' house, going across their alley and down two houses to go through their yard. I end up back in the alley behind my house. I see Mary Robbins. She talks about me paying for a trip around the world."

I am trying to get cash at an ATM machine. I take out my cash, which is silver. I take out another card, which is a young woman's card. There is a sheet of photographs that I am in. The photograph sheet has to be redone because the makeup is too heavy."

One man commits suicide so he can be with his dead relatives. On the second floor of the house are a living man and dead people that look alive. The living man has a shovel and he uses it to try to hit the head of a dead man after the dead man throws a pie in his face. This works. I'm in a bedroom with my cousin Anna Strange. We are engaging in sexual activity. She checks to make sure she isn't having her period. She isn't. She says it was bad this month. She pats some toilet paper on her vagina and then tastes what is on the toilet paper. She says it's okay. She and I are wearing underwear. She crawls on top of me, and under the sleeping bag. I then have female genitals, and Anna has male genitals. I take her erect penis and put it in my vagina. I move her hips at first because she doesn't get the hang of it. Then she does get the hang of it. This feels good to me. She ejaculates quickly. I am not even close to orgasm. She cries, feeling guilt and shame. There is semen and secretions all over. She then has a vagina and I touch her. There is semen everywhere. We need to clean up. I take something that looks like a rag, but it is a washcloth."

We go slowly. At one point I think we're going off the side of the bridge. The bridge is made of plywood and has no railings. We are not in a car anymore. We go through a tunnel. My mom says that the key to the tunnel is to slide, and she demonstrates how.  I am in a room. My friend Melanie McDyss is there. My cousin Anna Strange is there, and has food in her teeth. A man from my paleontology class named Ian is there. He has a turkey drumstick with his name on it. His name on the drumstick is W____ W____ W____ ( I forget the name but the initials are W.W.W.). A classmate from Brimson is there, named Hunter. He says his only name is Hunter. There is a tunnel that looks and smells like plastic tubing. People are supposed to go ion it. IT starts out funnel-like. There is facial hair in the funnel part of the tunnel.  I'm in the kitchen at home. I'm eating dinner with my mom and my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. I talk about why I'd rather not do something (I forget what it is that I'd rather not do). I say this because I have a routine and I need to avoid stress so I stay in the routine. The routine I talk about is my way of doing homework at Brimson: the way I block time to allow for everything. I say Annie's mother was really rude to me the last time I saw her. Annie says that her mother has changed. There is a new drug. My brother Wally may be on the drug, or knows about it, my mom says. She talks about how Wally is doing. I pick up a chocolate frosted yellow cupcake and walk towards the bathroom. Annie goes into the bathroom with me. She pulls down her pants and boxers shorts, sits down on the toilet, and starts urinating. Urine and feces start coming up out of the drain of the sink! The feces are white like old dog feces left to dry in a yard. The mixture is frothy and bubbly in the sink. Annie says her head hurts. I pat her head. I flush the toilet, which has already been flushing. Some urine and feces get on the floor. I pick them up and put them back in the sink, and rinse my hands. The bathroom is tilting from side to side. The water from the toilet overflows and splashes on the floor as the bathroom tilts. The room we are in is like my uncle Brian Vincent's kitchen in Iowa. My cupcake eating was messy. It was a chocolate cupcake that crumbled into the sink. Brian has an 11 person International House in Iowa. Things in the kitchen are stuck to the floor as it tilts."

It is black with holes cut out for my eyes, mouth, and ears. The cute woman throws a snowball that smashes me in the ear hole of my helmet. The police come to see what is going on. I try to explain we were just joking around with the snowballs. The police take Stephen away. The woman and I get along well."

I touch her vagina and give her cunnilingus. The family that lives on the corner of 1st Street and Next Avenue in Oak Valley is moving. I grab two garbage cans of stuff and put them away, and then I run back upstairs to the bathroom. We don't have much time. We have sex. I try to make her have an orgasm. We are rushed. We hear voices outside the door, which is locked. I didn't want to have genital sex with her because I come to climax quickly without her reaching orgasm, but since we are running out of time we have sex. She doesn't have an orgasm: there is not enough time or stimulation."

My clean laundry is in the Green House. I think I'll get it later. I go into a dorm. My friends Sherman Andrews and Lance Drift are there, talking about a beating or riot that went on because they were kicked out. They name several prominent Brimson people and say they are going back to get them. The building we're in is a hotel with stairs like the top floor of Social Science Hall. I go too far up the stairs, and then find the right floor. I can't find my room. My friend Darlene Miller is on the phone talking with someone about hot tub or movie plans. She is very particular. My room key says number 109. I find my room. There are many numbers on my room door, including 109. I open the door. People are having sex! I hesitate to go in, but do because I want to know whom it is. It is my old roommate Jens Nils and his girlfriend Natasha Lens. There are several of each of them, and they are having sex in different parts of the room! I pick up a chair and throw it over the bunk bed. It lands on the other side without hitting them. I rip off a ladder that is attached to the bed horizontally. Natasha sits up. She has read hair. I run the ladder at them, but they are not there: it is my imagination."

I'm wearing my Phillips 66 shirt. It starts raining. Kari and Ivory think that it's weird that I stand in the rain, but I do. I walk with Kari towards Last Avenue. I am standing behind her, and I start to touch her sexually on the outside of her clothes. I feel down by her pubic hair. We are waiting to cross Last Avenue. She is holding my penis, which is going between my legs and out behind me. She is holding it behind me. Cars go by. We cross quickly. We are in people's dirt yards, without grass, standing on cement. I'm walking on the cement edge of a street that is in the front yard of the white house on the left of Holt's house. I think I should deliver to Mike's garage since I am near there, but I don't. I tell my friend Beth Mock, or my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas, who is then the woman I am with, to wait. I tell her to come with me, and I run behind a farmhouse. There are horses in the area that run away. The grass is coarse pasture. I sit down next to a place where I think no windows will allow people to see us. Annie comes to me and says, \"Fuck me!\" I unbutton her light brown pants, which are from the 1980's, and pull them down to her ankles. We have never had sex before. I give her cunnilingus. She has an erection like a dog's erection: no penis head. She doesn't like me sucking on her erection: it doesn't feel good. Her clitoris is on the underside of her erection. I like her erection."

I ask why not stay at Grandpa's, since we're here? I don't want the couple to be with us. We pull of the highway on the exit ramp slowly. The exit ends.

I hold it up to everyone and tell, say \"Look!\", and then disgustedly tell them to get out of there. There is as stream next to the post. The stream is the health hazard. I try to get back to where the car is. I go over the stream. I step on old brown boards that are rotting. They are dried out. I fall in. I have my clothes and boots on. I try to swim. My sister Heather is yelling, saying something about going backwards. I finally make it to the edge of the stream, which is cement."

I shake Rich's hand and pat Melvin's head. I hear that a boy from my neighborhood named Chris has died. I leave. I go by my Brimson classmate Molly and others. I go out the front door.

I watch this as I walk past my van. I turn around and go back to the van."

I call him, and he asks me about the battery. I have forgotten to charge it, and quickly put the battery charger on it for a bit. My friend's mother, Sharon Kasper, whose name is pronounced \"Shorn\", calls for me. My mom gives me the message that she wants me to pick up her son Jerry and his friend in Beetville tonight. They are in Beetville without a ride home. I don't call Sharon back. I don't want to pick them up: I'm busy going fishing. My mom says I should call her, so I go and pick up the phone. There is no dial tone. I say hello. It is Jerry's father Myron. I say to him that I just picked up the phone and even without a dial tone he was there! I feel guilty, but I tell him that I'm going fishing at Many Fish and I can't pick up Jerry tonight. I tell him where the lake is. He wanted to go out with his wife and needed someone to pick up Jerry. We get dressed for the cold. My brother Wally, and sister Ramona are going too. I wear a red ski mask with the face cut out and a blue scarf. We leave.  We are out at the lake. My classmate Diane has a reel with no rod. She is marking out an area by casting. Seeing the weed line, I tell her to just cast it out a little bit. She does, and reels it in. She gets a hit when the lure, which is a blue/gray/silver rattlin' fat rap, is almost in to shore. That was a test cast for her. She is holding the line in her hand, on a spool of fishing line. We are on the water. I take of my glove-mittens and throw them to a third girl who is in the water. I grab the rod, which is in the water. I tell her to let out a lot of line, because I know the fish will break the line coming from the spool since there is no flexibility. I connect the line with all its slack to the rod, which doesn't have a reel. I get washed in towards shore as I start to wind the line around the spool of thread. I feel the weeds on my body, but I am clothed, so it's not as aversive a feeling. A big wave comes and washes over me. I am washed up, now on the shore. I follow the fishing line. The fish is on the end of it: a nice-sized northern pike. It is still hooked. I cheer! Matt and another person are there. Matt takes the fish and lets it go at the shoreline. I am happy. It is dark. I remember I forgot to pick up Matt. Wally or Matt lends me a quarter and I go to Sandwhich Heaven to call Matt. Matt's brother Jasper answers the phone. He tells me Matt knows I forgot, and he wanted a confirmation call. He had driven out to the lake and will hope to meet us by the shore. I go back to the lake. Matt is swimming in the water with a man named Bobby whom I know through a friend from Brimson, and his friends. I'm in a large, nice boat with an inboard motor. Matt is driving the boat. We bump into some boats that are docked. There is a party-like atmosphere. I am on an object that may be a jet ski, in the water. I bounce on this object, going down to the bottom of the water, to a cement pool-like bottom. Then I shoot up out of the water 10 or 12 feet into the air. Once I squish my classmate Kyle Mendelson between the object and the cement floor. I squish his head. My cousins Bertha Strange, Archie Weber, and Ramona had their faces photographed in one of those circus items where the bodies are painted on a board and the heads are cut out. There is a photograph of me looking like a goofball and making my funny noises. There is a photograph of my friend Niles Zelling. My classmate Sarah Pauly is singing Karoke. I walk on the floor of the lake/pool with my eyes open. I poke Kyle in the shoulder. He is scared of me because I hurt him earlier. I push off the bottom and get to the surface for air. I am standing on a platform above the water. I decide to take paleontology for a grade rather than Pass/Fail. My classmate Shawn or Ryan Bay is on a similar platform, and decides to take a class Pass/Fail. I slide down a pole. I am going down a lattice-like ladder. The water looks like a lake in some respects."

I am in awe of its huge and massive size. On a smaller peak next to it I see a ski lift and ski slopes. I am so excited! I am happy and I cheer and think that we are going to have so much fun! I am skiing with my friends Tim and Niles Zelling. There are three boxes of cereal and two gallons of milk, one of which is 2%, where we are staying. The milk hasn't been refrigerated and is warm and sour. We seem to be in Australia. There are many lifts to go up the hill on. There is a power quad lift. We go up on a lift. There are then no chairs for the lift, which is a rope or cable that we're hanging on to. It keeps going up with no end in sight. We might not be able to get off. There is another lift near where we are. We are low to the ground. I ask the guys if we should just jump off and go to the other lift. My dad is there. He tells me to wrap the cable around the metal pole that is holding the cable up, so the cable will stop moving. I do this by pulling myself up and stretching and wrapping the cable around the pole. Tension builds as the cable is pulled tighter, without snapping. My coworker Shawn Tryner is there. I tell him to watch out or he could get hurt when the cable snaps. I go up a lift and ski down in deep, powdery snow. Another man is there. I have just gone down an area that I picture to be like Corbet's Coulier in Jackson Hole. The man says something about \"frag\" or a ___, which are puffy snow sculptures of these images on top of the four or five feet of existing snow. He says how he likes how he likes one better, or how one is easier to wipe out or kill. I go through a brick tunnel, past a loading area, to another ski lift. I go past my friend Melanie McDyss, who is waiting for a ski lift. I talk to my friend Norman Noman, who is by the ski lift. It is almost 2:00 pm, and I say I'll meet him down by the chalet for lunch after my next run down. Where we are, part of the slope is grassy. I go to the lift line. I have a snowboard attached to my left foot. I wait, and a young woman comes around me in line. I get on the lift with a woman. We don't talk for a while. Then I say, \"How ya doing today?\" I slur my speech a little bit. I think she is about my age. She replies to my question. I realize she is an older woman, 50 or 60 years old. I didn't realize this earlier. We ride up. There is snow in places and grass in others. It is warm and the snow is slushy. Cows are out on the slopes sitting and grazing. We get to the top. I get off the lift and can't move well because I'm on grass. I had been carrying my skis up in my hand by their tips. I am holding a show chunk that I scooped out of a snow bank on the way up the hill. I want to throw it at a cow, but the woman is there and she would think I'm cruel if I do that. The lady skis well when we get off the lift, even though there is no snow. My classmate Kyle Mendelson is there, wearing roller blades instead of skis. The snow is melting on top of the mountain, and there is a lot of grass. People are looking for a snowy area to ski down the mountain. I have no poles. It is hard for me to move on flat land at the top. There is a frozen lake that we go over. I go by a shed with many brooms and dustpans in it. I think of using the broom handles as poles. Some men talk about going to Brisbane to get out, and finding a Celtc, which I understand to be a road."

He runs; he has to be somewhere that he isn't. The countdown is at 14 when Kevin starts running. I go by my teacher, who can't count well, and say all different numbers instead of counting down. The vaccine occurs at 20 according to her count. I'm in a classroom as a guest. The class and teacher are friendly. They know I've graduated. I say that I'm back to observe. They say I'm tall. I say I have knee problems. I have a laptop computer that I plug into the socket in back of the desk in front of me. The male teacher, who seems to be the dominant teacher because he is in front of the class, jokes about a dream in which he loses teeth. The kids comment about my height, as does a female teacher. The female teacher says I should take off my shoes to see my height. I don't do this. She says I need to put on more weight, and get wider."

Tyler stands up, which seems to be the polite thing to do, giving Wally a visual reprimanding. I go into the grille and order a Rueben.

I jump into the lake, yelling, to distract people from the fact that I just bumped kids with my truck. I wash my sleeve and all the oil comes out. I dunk my head under the water.

He says there should be a different amount of this substance there: that is how he knows it's broken. The interior structure of my right leg consists of thin tubing, a few joints, and a couple of stretched springs in the ankle. The man starts putting these together to show me.

One of them tells me I have to pay 50 cents when I leave for skate rental. I tell him to remind me to do this. I skate around the rink a few times. I am partially in control of my body on skates, partially out of control. One end of the rink has a tight brownish-gray carpet on it. It is easy to skate on the carpet, and it gives me traction. My old neighbor Bill Dinks is the other rink attendant. I nearly collide with him, but we avoid each other. At the non-carpeted end of the rink a person gets points if he or she does tricks or stunts. We are now on roller blades. Stephen is saying in his characteristic way that he is nailing his tricks and getting good scores. I don't really care about what he is saying. After you do tricks you sit back down on a bench and your score for the trick is displayed. Stephen is saying how his scores were in the 700's. I do a bunch of out of control 360-degree spins and get 325 points. I see myself sit down on the bench. I am wearing my red economics t-shirt and I have long hair. The rink is then around my house. I go off the rink onto my neighbors the Trammell's lawn, down the hill in front of their house, across their driveway, and jump off the hill on the other side of their driveway. I roller blade down the sidewalk. My high school friend Jack Miller is there. He jumps over a boat on a skateboard. I go to the intersection of Home Avenue and 2nd Street. There is a nun driving a bus. I think she is driving too slowly. I see my classmate Monique Thorble get dropped off at the intersection of Next Avenue and 2nd Street. She starts walking south on Next Avenue, going home. I roller blade down 2nd Street and turn right on Next Avenue, going south. Monique looks good, as always. I try not to look like I'm trying hard to impress her. There is a woman on roller blades going north on Next Avenue who goes past us. She is wearing a lot of fancy roller blade gear. I turn right onto the Christianson's sidewalk and go behind their house over to Mrs. Shelly's house. I think of jumping off Mrs. Shelly's steps, but instead I ride down them. I cross Home Avenue and skate up the smooth part of our steps. In our back yard is a baby that is with my young neighbors Ricky and Alan Broud. My sister Ramona and my cousins Melvin, Rich, and Melissa Redding have left the baby. I am very disturbed that this has happened. I change the baby's diaper. I am not good at changing diapers. I pull off the old diaper and notice smelly yellow transparent feces. I wipe off the butt and penis of the baby, which is a boy. The baby may start to get an erection when I do this. The clean diaper is made of cloth. I get the diaper on the ground and want to have the baby sit on it so I can wrap it around his waist. The grass is freshly cut and some blades of grass keep getting on the diaper before the baby sits down. I learn that the reason Ramona and my cousins aren't here is that our cars have been crushed. Someone hit the parking brake on a vehicle and our car and the two cars from their family collided. My classmate Ted Fitz drives up in a new used car, which is a gray convertible. It is the replacement car."

There is a formula for measuring the thickness based on one measurement. Something in the formula is _. My friend Jill Banks is in the class. I sit in a corner. There is a metal shelf system that partially blocks Jill's view of me. My classmate Todd Murphy is there. Greg asks for any questions. My hand and arm are lying across my forehead, like I do when I fall asleep, but I don't have a question. Greg looks at me, but seems to know that my arm is up because it's comfortable for me, not because I have a question. I hoping he doesn't call on me. There are no questions. He then gets the test scores out. I get a 96 on the final, which is the top score! My upper teeth are pressing down on my bottom lip. I associate with Jill and Todd. I can't talk because of my lip and teeth. I feel like I am getting sick: I have a dry cough. But I think I'm not getting sick. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas in the hallway.  I'm at lunch in the Brimson grille. I see my economics professor Zoe Madden there. She congratulates me on my good geology grades. I say thanks. I ask her what happened to my economics grade: why I got an A-. She says I failed the final test, but I went to class, to the extra sessions, and I did well on the other tests so I got an A-. I'm getting orange juice. Kari Cutting, a psychology professor, is there. She asks me if I have a boyfriend, but I know she means a girlfriend. I say no. She asks if I'll wait with her at the bus stop. There are sexual intonations in her question. Though I am not interested in her, I agree to wait with her. There is no juice in the grille so I tell her I'll wait for her in the hall by the juice machines.  I'm in a car with George Costanza from the television show Seinfeld. He is driving. I'm thinking of writing down my dreams, which involve a Seinfeld episode. We're near a college like the University of Montana. He is going to the university for a visit. I tell him I forgot about Kari Cutting at the bus stop so I need to go back right now! He refuses to go back, and won't return to drop me off. I make a huge fuss over this. I kick him, hit him, and yell at him furiously. My black and blue sunglasses fly out of the car and land on the road ahead of us as we slow down. A lens on the glasses cracks like the pattern of a spider web, and gets scratched. I blame George for this. We turn back. I'm on a bicycle on Superhighway 100, and am going to take the Superhighway 200. I'm going slowly on the bicycle, and there is about a mile before the exit for Superhighway 200. I pass a semi truck that is parked. I am in a semi truck. I go into a large truck yard. My friend Jerry Parsons from Fishing Haven is there driving a huge truck. He has stolen it for a joyride. I think this is bad. He drives with another man. Eventually I drive the truck too. It is an 8-wheel dump truck. I drive for a bit and decide I'm refreshed. I decide to leave. The man and Jerry try to stop me from leaving. I take my green shirt and dark blue sweatshirt from the building when I leave. The building is a house that is used for cleaning."

I am with Kevin in a canoe near river water. My high school classmate's father Gary Lind is there. I talk with Kevin about the Big Resort Area and about the trip. I say it will be two weeks: September 1st- whenever, and we'll go from Woodsville to the Backcountry Highway. He is skeptical about the trip. We leave and kick paddle our canoes back to a house. We do this by leaning our legs out the back end of the canoes while lying on our stomachs, and kicking. We get to the house. Kevin's father Dilbert Simpson is there. He scolds us for kicking our canoes past Gary. He says Gary was fishing and we shouldn't have disturbed him. We walk up the shore a little ways. Kevin nods and says yes, accepting what his father has to say. I tell Dilbert off. I say it makes no difference whether he is fishing or not. Kevin is standing there wishing I would shut up and shaking his head as if to say, \"No! Don't say it!\" But I go on. I say to Dilbert, \"Whether you are grilling and a boat goes by, who cares? I don't like you! You are cold and impersonal. One can turn to you for any work problem: to fix a boat, car, wall, or anything, but not to deal with people.\" Dilbert is agitated but remains poised. He says, \"I'll borrow a phrase\", as if he is too good to use normal language. He says, \"I'm pissed off!\" He is mad at me. I say to him, \"Kiss my ass! I don't give a fuck what you think or feel! You don't know crap!\" Dilbert is flabbergasted. He is hurt and speechless. He says nothing in the wake of my angry venting. There is nothing he can say. Kevin is hurt too. He doesn't want me to talk this way.  I go to my truck in the alley at home in Oak Valley. It is dark outside. There is a yellow car behind me as I go down the alley hill. The truck moves before I start it. I put it in 2nd gear when I do start it because I'm already moving. Dilbert and Kevin are inside my house saying goodbye. They are about to leave. I'm in front of the house with my mom, sister Ramona, uncle Rusty Redding, and my cousin Melvin Redding. I am going back to the Big Resort Area. It is my day off. I shake hands with Rusty, saying goodbye. My car is a green Volkswagen Beetle with a trailer attached. There is a clip missing for the windshield wiper on the passenger side. Rusty adjusts the clip that is on the driver's side windshield wiper. My mom and I share a hug and kiss. I kiss her on the cheek and on the lips. This is strange: I haven't ever kissed mom on the lips. It feels almost incestuous, uncomfortable. I tell them I've got a lot of driving to do for a tired guy, and that I'll get some caffeine when I get gas. I ask my mom to stay and talk with me a bit before I leave. She does, and the others leave. I tell her about Kevin and what happened with he and Dilbert. I am upset over this. Ramona is there. I let her stay and listen to us talk: who cares if she is there, I think. I start to drive very slowly. I say I've got to do some work on that dream, recognizing that what happened with Kevin and Dilbert was a dream. I start to cry. I stop the car on Home Avenue. I yell out loud and cry! It is very emotional for me. I leave the car there. I have a strong need to work on the dream. I quickly say to my mom to take care of the car. I run back home to work on the dream. The dream is calling me."

I think it is a crop duster leaving trails. I get my parents, who are inside cooking dinner. The planes are very low and are in a very neat flying pattern. One plane shines a light down in our back yard. I am in the illuminated spot at first, and then I run out of the spotlight. It is like a light from an alien spaceship. An object drops from a plane. I know it is a bomb. I run and hide next to the red brick wall separating my neighbor Alvin Broud's yard and the adjacent house. I crouch down and cover myself. There are many atomic bombs dropping all over. One bomb lands in the back yard of the yellow house on the corner of 2nd Street and Hill Avenue. I am running by when it hits.

People go here to fish, and pay by the pound for the fish they catch. There are price boards in the little store there, for how much it costs to fish.

I give Annie cunnilingus, and then we have sex. She seems a bit uncomfortable. She has betrayed me. She got involved with another man this summer. I want to ask her if they had sex with him, but I don't ask. His name is Mr. X. He has to come to her house for something, as if she is pregnant and they need to deal with that. She shuts off the lights in the room, so she doesn't have to look at me. We lay there. I shut the music off, but it keeps playing. I shut it off again. I hold her off to one side. She is not feeling what I feel, not acting, and not responding. I recognize this, but don't want to accept it"

I say this to the other pilot, but it doesn't seem to matter. I'm excited and nervous about fling a little plane so high up. There is a scene like in the movie Top Gun, in which there are two pilots getting ready to take off. One of them is a rookie. One pilot flies over and drops a fake rubber bomb, just joking around. The rookie is annoyed at this. The rookie and the veteran pilot trade punches, kind of sizing each other up when they meet. My friend Kevin Simpson may be a pilot of another plane."

The waitress is crabby and short-tempered. Several waiters are there to help clear away the dishes when we're done. A man comes to our table. He seems to be the manager. He is wearing dark pants, a white shirt with stripes, and a tie. He wants my mom to write a check to pay for the meal, and then he'll give her cash. This somehow benefits him. He estimates the cost of our meal using a calculator. He figures my mom's meal to be about five dollars, and everyone else's meal to be about $2.75. I had what my mom had plus an appetizer, so I figure my meal will be the most expensive, costing more than seven dollars. My meal costs a lot more than the others. The man figures the cost of the meal to be about $25. He gives mom a $20 bill and $5 for a tip. He comes back a little bit later and says that $25 isn't enough to pay for the bill, and gives mom a $50 bill. Wally, Ramona, and Heather order more food. I don't realize they do this until it arrives at the table. When it does, they are not at the table. I eat whatever it is that I can, stuffing it into my mouth. The food consists of fried appetizers. My mom writes a check to pay for the meal. The man ends up paying for the whole meal. The waitpersons are crabby and impatient. We walk out of the restaurant. I see a person I know from high school named Karin Bellview. I look at her and say hi. She is sitting on the ground. It takes her a little while to realize it is I, but she does, and says hi. I say that the whole experience in the restaurant was weird."

There is a second trap door, like the one we actually have, which closes the stairs off totally from the kitchen. I try to close this door. There is a hinge and chain which doesn't allow it to close all the way. I stomp on the door, pull it, and break the hinges. The trap door then lies flat. I think the bears will come up the stairs. The bear starts to come up, nudging open the trap door. We run. I get some pots and pans and clang them together to scare the bear off. There is only one bear now. I almost hit the bear with them, which would be a mistake, but the bear runs off from the clanging pots."

I see Wisconsin shaded on the map because there are so many deer there. There are only a few deer in Minnesota, the some states to the south and west of it. There seems to be a line running north/south along the map from the Wisconsin-Minnesota border along the other state borders that denotes the good hunting land. I am with a group of people from ____ (I forget). I have a cigarette in my mouth. I don't smoke it; I just let it hang there to look cool. Someone comments on my sideburns and goatee. I am the only person with sideburns and a goatee, which I kind of like. I'm dressed like a cowboy, all made up in my clothes, as are some men from my high school who are there, including Brett Ball, Izzy Hay, and Rick Hartley. I think it's odd that we're dressed the same. We are leaving. It seems we may have been at Grandma and Grandpa Redding's farm. I get into a jeep with my friend from high school Lyle Zeffman and my roommate Stephen Ramos. We pack into crowded jeep with others. Someone else is driving. There are two other vehicles going. We are driving to a place. There are more women than men, maybe in a 13:4 ratio. I say I've had my cigarette for a day. I fold up the unsmoked cigarette and put it in the ashtray in the vehicle. I say that we need to get my friend Kevin Simpson. We're going to a hotel-like place that is run by a very strict, staunch head nun. She does things only her way. It seems the has been entertaining groups like ours for years, and she likes and expects ups to come and meet and greet her in the same way as the other groups. We are instructed about this before arriving. At this place it is my mom's birthday. They are making some sort of lemon coffee cake especially for the occasion. People are lined up to get some of this. I am kind of out of line, so I budge in front of people. We need to line up again, and I go to the end of the line since I feel guilty about budging in front of others earlier. They are two groups I know at the end of the line. They allow me to go ahead of them because they don't think I should go last in line, since it's my mom's birthday. There is a fat army man serving the food. After one gets their food they are supposed to go down stairs. When I am served, coffee spills off my plate. I go downstairs. They ask us to think about a question while we eat. I sit by myself to figure the question out. My mom is there. My friend Matt Yams' brother Jasper is there, eating. We are to file back up the stairs when we're done eating."

There is a person, which may be me, hanging from the edge of a window outside the plane. I feel the grip the person has on the window. The person moves along, hanging from different windows, moving towards the back of the plane. The person finds a window that has a good grip. The person knocks on the window with their right hand, to signal for help! No one is seated next to the window. A woman with short dark hair, who reminds me slightly of my coworker Lauren, is sitting across the aisle from the window. She notices the knock, but looks over as if it is impossible anything is outside the plane. The woman eventually comes over to the window or realizes, to her horror, that there is someone outside the plane! When she realizes this, the engines of the plane fly into reverse to slow it down so they can bring the person in through the window. The people inside the plane roll the inner window down and somehow get the outer window off. The mother of the person outside the plane, who is a girl, is inside the plane. The mother has long straight blond hair. The girl climbs in through the window. I feel myself climbing in through the window. The girl hugs her mother.  I am on a plane with my mom and my friend Melanie McDyss. I hug Melanie. I feel exhausted and relaxed, as if I have just finished or accomplished something important. I am happy. Melanie sits on my lap. I hug her while we sit. I tell her how much I care about her and love her. We are sleeping. I have my arms around her. She moves my hand because it may have made her uncomfortable where it was, resting on her thigh, with some sexual feeling to it. I am then careful about touching her because I don't want to offend her. She moves and sleeps with my mom in her seat where there is more room, and where we won't be touching. The plane has landed. We go out to eat with my dad, my aunt Sheila Redding, and others. Shelia speaks of brown sugar stir-fry with pecans, and says she ate all of it.  I'm in a car driving with my mom, Sheila, my brother Wally, and others. I talk about what a busy schedule I have. My schedule overlaps. I am supposed to be somewhere for three weeks from sometime in August until September 8th. Schools starts September 8th, and I am supposed to work then as well.  I'm walking near Wilmerton University. Other people are there. I see my psychology professor Marianne Stash and her partner, who is really pale-skinned. They are having a good conversation as they walk. Marianne is characteristically attentive. We walk by each other, and I don't say hi. I go into a big building. There is a party being held there later. I have a big roll of crepe paper. Three admission men deny me access to go upstairs while others are setting up. I want to go upstairs. They say I can't because if I go upstairs I'd have to walk through the gymnasium, and there are people in the gymnasium who want not to be interrupted. I am mad! I think it is dumb that I can't go in. The men don't really have authority. They get it because people accept what they say. I think to myself: why do I even listen to them? I walk out of the building feeling frustrated and say, \"Fuck this!\" The women's bathrooms there are being cleaned. Marianne walks by as I leave. She is going in the women's bathroom. I tell her that they wouldn't let me in, and we'll see how she can do. I see a big list of people on a kiosk that are coming. It is comprised of many alumni and professors. I wouldn't want to be there. As I walk out, I see a friend's father, Greg Kulik. I say hi and walk towards him. I have the roll of crepe paper in my right hand. As I walk towards Greg, I shake someone's hand. It is an awkward handshake because the grip wasn't right. I shake Greg's hand when I get to him, using my left hand. I think that I am greeting him warmly, while in the past I have been wrong or bad to him, which I know in the back of my mind. I see my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas and her father Bill come in the outer doors in the background of other people. I don't do anything, but act like I don't see her, in order to make her react first to seeing me. Suddenly my high school and grade school classmates John Kulik, Patrick Bergman, and Eric Stoner are right in front of me. Eric is shirtless, but wearing a light blue v-cut jean jacket that looks like it is from the 1980's. John is arrogant, like he has heard me talk about how dumb, weak, and stupid he is. He is there with a big cocky grin and long hair. He has come with his buddies to retaliate to what I have said and to make a big deal of it. They want to fight me. One of the three goes in front of me, and another behind me, where a granite bench is. It is as if they are going to push me back over the bench. I say to them, \"What are you guys doing?\", with a tone in my voice indicating I think their actions are dumb. I think I could beat up all three of them. I am more powerful than any one of them, but I think maybe I can take them all on at the same time. I am not afraid, but this is not the place for a fight. Annie is there and she smiles arrogantly as if she has sided with the three of them, and wants revenge against me as well, and she'll get it by having the three men come after me. She smiles as the three men prance around me. They are belligerent. I know I could beat them up but would rather not do so with all the people around, right in front of them."

I shoot a lot of gang members. I get shot from behind, and I say to the person who shot me that I'm already dead! I feel nothing. I'm in a building with others. I'm in a room with two people. We're supposed to watch a movie, which we go to do. I have seen it before, I say. The movie is not that good. In the movie, there is fake blood on a dead person."

I ask them how they know the Thomas'. Sherry says she has a class with Annie. There are many shorthaired women there. My dad and I talk to Bill Thomas. I try to avoid Annie. My dad takes out his checkbook to make a deal with Bill regarding Annie and I. Annie comes towards me happily. I turn and direct myself towards her when I realize she's approaching. She is wearing blue and is happy. She happily says that she and I are going to take a 10-minute walk. I guess my dad bought or bargained with Bill for me to have 30 minutes with Annie. There is a boat in front of their house. A motor is in the boat. The boat is old and run of water: run down. Annie drives slowly out of the driveway in a small green car, ready to go on a walk. My dad follows in a car. I'm walking. I motion with my hand for them to go by me and keep going because something is not right: the timing or a distraction. A big Lite Ice beer semi truck comes towards us, the doors on our side of the truck are swinging open as it goes past. I Think Annie will come back and get me for our walk."

We have sometime before the movie, so we're going to the Dairy Queen nearby in my brother Wally's car. I'm in a mall-like restaurant/hotel-like place. My mom and Ramona have come to clean up my sister Heather's cat's mess at the hotel. Heather wanted a cat for her birthday. She is at work, and can't take care of it. There is shredded paper and urine in the fountain of the hotel that needs to be cleaned up. There is a formal gathering occurring there. I empty a garbage can containing green class. A man tells me to be quiet because of the gathering. I am quiet. I tell my mom I think she has given Heather too many chances. I take the trash to throw it away in rooms that have signs on the outside that say \"Open\". Two very short ladies go to use the bathroom. Along the walls are photographs and drawings of northern pike's mouths with the whole fish in the background. There are some men painting in the mall.

When they are out at the portage, Stephen hits his head on a rock and goes into a coma, I am told. Stephen's father Franco is then going out in a boat with Mike. They go backwards in the boat. The area is not Eagle Lake: it is a different lake. I am on shore. Mike and Franco need a double-bladed paddle. I get their attention and drive out in a wide fishing boat to give it to them. On the way back I drive across grassy lawns and cement sidewalks in the boat. It seems I am over near Riverside School in Wilmerton. I get down to the end of the lawns and do a baseball slide onto my high school classmate Tanya Simmons' front lawn. She is inside the house cooking: I see her through a window, and feel like I'm disturbing them. I go into my friend Tiny Comb's house, which is then there. Tiny, his brother Matt, and their mother are there. They warn me about scraping up other people's lawns. They say people will be mad at me. I say I understand.  I'm at home in the large bedroom upstairs. My friend Stephen is in a bed. He moves. I say, \"Ramosluuu, are you awake?\" He is. I ask him what he remembers. He has no recollection of his coma. I tell him what happened to him. I'm going to bed. He shuts off the lights in the hallway for me. There are other people in the room, including several young girls about 14 years old. One has red hair, and several have brown hair. I get a phone message from a girl from Dayton's whose name is Cretia or Lucretia. I remember meeting with her vaguely when I understand the message. She is going to call back. My classmate from Brimson Jana Green is there eating some kind of cookie-like cold cereal. She doesn't like it. I try it, and spill some on my bed. I don't want to eat it off my bed because the bed is dirty, crusty, and gross."

The candles by the altar are burning out; there is no wick left. I'm wearing a green and white sweater that is too short for me. My white t-shirt shows from underneath the sweater. I have on a pair of jeans and tennis shoes. Back in the sacristy I change into and orange and white striped shirt with an orange windbreaker over it, and tan colored pants with boots. Fathers Dan Pink and Vance Brock are presiding. I see them in the sacristy. I get an extra long robe to wear. The sizes on the robes have a three-digit number. My number may be 267. My brother Wally is at church but doesn't help serve. I play the Bare Naked Ladies or Grant Lee Buffalo in a cassette player over the speakers in church before mass starts. When I shut the music off, my sister Ramona goes up and starts playing the piano as the introduction to mass. I go out the south side door, running to get back by the time she is done playing piano. I go through the basement and the kitchen. Items for baking are set out. I'll come by later and get something to eat. I go up the back stairs to the sacristy. One sign reads \"Construction\". The hallways lead to a hospital and other places. I have trouble finding the sacristy. I find it: it leads to or is a gymnasium. It's full of people. My mom, Ramona, Wally, sister Heather, aunt Sheila Redding, uncle Rusty Redding, and their kids Melvin, Melissa, and Rich are there shooting free throws in some sort of a game or contest. I'm outside Carter School. We get 24 large metal cans delivered on two trucks. I carry two cans at a time on my shoulders to exercise my back muscles. My boss Phoebe Mills may be there telling me where to put things. I haul the cans to the old equipment/ball room. The trucks that left the barrels also left some wet, dirty equipment packs for us, from the dump. I hang them above the Thermarests in the equipment room at Fishing Haven. One man driving the truck wants out glass for recycling. There is some outside and some in the equipment room. My friend Tom Napper is there with a big dog. It wants to go outside again, and Tom is annoyed with it. I'm back in the old equipment/ball room. Some people who are seniors in high school have submarined the room, messing it up. The room is half full of balloons. I try to pop them with a torch, which doesn't work well. Then I pop them with a scissors, so we'll see and take class. The school is empty. There is a mail jeep with a red and blue stripe parked outside. I find some chocolate ice cream in a refrigerator down where the first grade coat area is. I run with the ice cream. I'm going to eat it or put it in the freezer. I go through the gymnasium. The door to he music room is open. I get down near the north end of the building on the lower level where the freezer is. My third grade teacher Liza Minikel is there cleaning. I hid the ice cream on the side of my body, and run down the hall towards the main doors. She doesn't see the ice cream, and must think I'm strange for running. Ramona sees me and chases me. I fake going out the back door to the playground by pushing it open, so she would hear it, then hiding around the sliding gymnasium door. I laugh as I go up the stairs, and she knows it's me. I don't fool her, and she comes into the gymnasium. She is wearing a bra and full brief underwear. She asks me if I like them. They seem scrunched up: vertically compressed."

I let the little muskie go down a slide-like black tube with water in it. It slides down. That is how one releases a muskie here. I am walking and I see my grade school classmate Helen Vader. She has really changed. I remember when I last saw her at the fair and told her that she had really changed. I don't say that now. She has chin-length straight blond hair and is wearing a lot of makeup, including lots of pink blush. We talk a little bit. She is going to school in Forkville. I see her mother Doreen Vader and wave at her. Doreen doesn't recognize me. The area is crowded with both fishermen and non-fishermen.

Tony bumps me hard when we meet. I'm not sure this is friendly or belligerent. We go to fish muskies. I walk past a swimming pool in which I see a northern pike chases a kid's spoon lure and hit it. The boy catches the fish. My big muskie lure gets caught in Tony's green sweatshirt. He gets the hook out and throws it to me. Not wanting to catch the lure, I let it land. The metal lip on the lure gets bent. I swear! I think I put the lip of the lure in my mouth, like a mouthpiece. My classmate from Brimson Ed Yarns is there. I go downstairs to where we get in. A man operates this place. It is a tourist place. I jump over some parts of the stairs onto another set of stairs. All the rules for the place are posted. People come and pay for time to fish here. I have my yellow spoon and two huge plugs. My high school classmate Jack Miller has the plugs in his life vest. The man is going to charge me $2 to use the spoon and $3 for some sort of permit. He says that the fishing will damage the rainbow trout population, and that's why I have to pay the fee. I say I'm not fishing for trout, I'm fishing for muskies, but he says it doesn't matter. Kevin comes down to the man and I. He doesn't have the other two lures. It would cost more to bring those in. I don't' way to may that much, and I leave. I go up to the man to get my yellow spoon, and the man tries to keep mine and give me a cheap version that looks like mine! I get angry with him and call him a fraud. I tell him I'll expose him! He quickly covers up his name on the boxes and things that are around so I don't see his name and tell others bad things about him. His name has five letters, starts with K, and contains the letters l, e, and i in it as well. I leave and go upstairs, walking out of the place. There is a very attractive young woman sitting at a table with others. She reminds me of an attractive young female customer we had at work recently. She looks at me briefly. I catch her off guard as I walk by. I can tell she is attracted to me. I walk out of the place, tossing a crumpled up piece of paper at a garbage can and missing. I don't stop to pick it up, and feel like a fool because the attractive woman may have seen my do this. I am walking in a mall. There is a bar there. I think of stopping to get a beer.

They are a rich dark green color, but not shiny or flashy. Painted n the corners of these cars are pink squiggly lines. Someone there says how he or she would like a green car like that. I think they are indicating one without hubcaps. I get in one of the cars, and the keys are under the seat! I start the car. Wally gets in the passenger seat, very surprised that I have the keys. I drive forward a bit and bump into one of the other green cars. The car is difficult to drive at first. I man comes out, and is angry. He asks, \"Where'd you get the keys?\" I tell him they were under the seat. I start to drive. The man looks at the other green car to see if I scratched it when I bumped into it. He gets into one of the other cars. He seems to be an owner-type guy, like he operates the place with these cars. He is going wherever I am. He doesn't want me to go without him, so he's coming along wherever I go. Two other dark green cars go out besides the one I drive. It is dark out. It's fun to drive. It feels neat, and I am nervous. I'm not going anywhere in particular, its' just that I'm out driving the old car. I'm nervous because I don't want to damage the car. The car is a stick shift. I accelerate quickly, after a bit of driving when I'm used to the car. I can see the old fashioned tires spinning around. I say it won't accelerate as quickly as my truck. I'm then on a bicycle. I cut across the road near a sidewalk where my grade school classmate Beth Tense is. I ride across in front of a turning car, and am close to being hit. Another woman is there. The bicycle seems to not have handlebars. I control the bicycle by shifting my weight or grabbing the frame somehow. It is as if there is a rod or stick that I use to steer, which extends out in front of the bicycle a couple feet. I reach straight down as if I were grabbing onto the frame and grab this steering device. I ride by some people that go to Brimson. My high school classmate Tammy Jostens walks by. We look at each other, knowing that we recognize each other, but don't say hi. I ride on the grass and the boulevard. I ride by people I know but we don't greet each other. I see a sign for Superhighway 200, which seems to be my destination. This may be at or near Brimson. There are racquetball courts with large windows cut out of the sides of them. There are houses there. My classmate from Brimson Kari Kosslyn cries because she is sad when her roommates go by her without talking to her. I say it's sad when that happens."

We can't drive or pull the boats through the water to go from the train area to the river, though there is a small swampy waterway. It is not big enough. I have both boats loaded onto one trailer, side by side. I look for a spot to land them. The pond in Hill Park is a possibility, I think, if we drive the boats through the storm drainage pipes. I see the pipes are full of water, and there would be no room for a boat. Our boss Mike tells us we need to pick up a different party of customers. We need to do one job after another, and will be a time crunch: we'll be late for the second party. I can't find a spot to land the double trailer. The sandy area right next to the river by the Boy Scout building is too steep to use a double trailer. There is another landing we'll have to use. It is back past Big Rock and connects to the main river via that swampy area. It is a nice, big, open paved landing. It is just a bit out of our way, but we'll have to take the time to do it. I eat all six rolls. Jasper asks me if there are any rolls: he wants some. I apologize, and say I ate them all. My boss Phoebe Mills threatens her partner Mike Hollow.

There is a line of food, like a buffet. My brother Wally is there and others I know. I get some food for Jasper since I ate all the rolls, and some for myself."

At first it seems like she is not physically there, as if I am nuzzling the thighs of an imaginary person. Then she is there. I do some kind of sucking action with my mouth over her clitoris. I lick and finger her clitoris. She starts rubbing her clitoris with her own fingers, masturbating. She is really into the sexual experience, so if I don't do exactly what she wants she'll do it herself or move my hand so it's done right. I see her genitals vividly. They are larger than life: bright red and pink colored, full and fleshy. She is secreting a lot of vaginal juices. She has an orgasm. She ejaculates a stream of fluid out of her urethra at the moment of orgasm. Stephen gives someone cunnilingus. There are other naked women available all around. I start to lick Annie again, and she doesn't like it. Emerald says something about Annie's ejaculation, implying I should know that Annie wouldn't be ready for or wanting cunnilingus again. The week before this, Annie and I had a sexual encounter. She has a crooked tooth, because she hit it when she was drunk at a bar. Then I have a crooked tooth. People talk about good smelling underwear. I say I don't have any. Someone says that I do: those polyester shiny silver pair.

The answer had to be inclusive of many perspectives and aspects. I have a Heineken beer. I take a sip of it. Eric, Patrick, and my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper have a sip of it too. Then they drink it all! I can have a beer in class because I'm 21. I intend to charge those guys $.60 each for the beer. It cost me $2, and all I got was one sip!

I see some deer out by the pine trees near the mailbox. I take a bow and arrows out of the case. I walk around the house to the big porch, where the deer were walking. I get there and my friends Stephen and Franco Ramos are there. The deer walk really close by. I'm not sure if it's okay for me to shoot. Stephen looks with bulging eyes, indicating to me I should shoot, but he doesn't say anything. I pull back the bow and shoot at one of the two does from my hip. The arrow is short: 12-16 inches long. I hit the deer high on the hindquarter. It runs away. It will live, which makes me glad because I don't want to wound a deer. Grandpa calls in the deer, and says we hit one but it got away. He plays with fishing weights and jigs in his fingers as he talks. I'm really excited about hunting since right away I shot at a deer. I see a big buck with a huge rack! I stalk the deer, waiting for it to move. It gets spooked and runs away. I'm still watching the two does that I shot at from across the field. My grade school classmate Rita Bauer comes and starts chopping up vegetables for a salad. I'm mad that she is making so much noise, and I try to quietly make her leave, which she won't do.  I'm eating dinner with Grandpa, Grandma, my brother Wally, aunt Joanne Redding, and others. Grandpa overeats, eating spaghetti noodles and peas. He gets drunk. He stands up and falls over. Wally catches him. I help Grandpa to the bathroom. He stumbles. I sit him down on the toilet. He falls off the toilet. He vomits into the toilet. I'm wearing rubber gloves while he vomits. I watch him. I remember what my coworker Jerry Parson's friend said about watching someone vomit: that one should see it! Grandpa vomits up the noodles and peas. He won't tell me which toothbrush is his. My aunt Rachel Redding and her son and my cousin Archie Weber are there. Grandma is sleeping. I look for deer using binoculars. There is a gas can on a chair. People clean up the room we are in."

I poke my elbow into Sam, and tell him we're going to Riverton for a basketball game at 5:30. My high school teammate Tony Kramer says we'll be leaving at closer to 4:15. I'm sitting around a table that is crowded with my high school basketball team. My friend Nate Nelling is wearing a sweater and a dress coat. It's like a reunion. I'm in a gymnasium shooting baskets with Sam and a woman. I am rusty and very stiff, my knees especially. The woman says I have good backspin on my shot. It's then pre-game high school basketball, Armstrong versus Riverton. I'm playing with my team from Armstrong. I war my old red, white, and black Nike shoes from my junior year. A rival player, Dan Dubbin, is playing for Riverton. He is tough. It is reminiscent of our glory days in high school. I sit down in a gymnasium-like locker room. I get dressed. I'm shirtless. I tie my shoes and loosen up, flexing my muscles. I slap hands with my teammate Binky Ahmed and others before the game. Binky has spilled something in his pocket. The place he spilled is where a pregnant woman's water has broken as well. The woman with whom I was shooting buckets says its' no good to tighten the second knot on a double knot. My sister Ramona, her friends, including Muriah Ahmed, my high school teammate Carl Everson, and others are there for the game. It is glory days relived."

I go into the Red Rooster Shop with my friend Stephen Ramos. He needs money so he divides up the staff tips and takes his share. I look at the merchandise for sale. I find a $5 bill behind a fishing lure, and keep it, quietly. I find two checks written to me from Stephen, which I had left on the shelf a while back. One is for $3.49, and the other for $.49. Stephen is mad at me, which is characteristic of him, because he thinks since I haven't cashed them I'm screwing up the balancing of his checkbook. There are some long thin rectangular stickers there. I leave them there: they are a secret with the guys I am with: Stephen, my coworker Tom Olson, and another man.

I think I should tell her she should go and just drive slowly, rather than sit here where she may be seen. Beth expresses her dislike for her job at Fishing Haven. We go to the dump. We go past a liquor store. My birthday comes up in conversation, since I'm now 21. We pass Francois' Restaurant, which is a huge liquor store. I say we should go there, and want to stop. We pass a police car. I tell Beth to keep her speed under 38 miles per hour because police will give tickets for anything more than that. She doesn't listen. I put my seat belt on in case we're pulled over. We drive to the dump, which is out on the Thru Highway, but we don't go that way. We are with other friends going to a concert. It's snowing.

We are then on 1st Street between Hill and Slope Avenues, in Oak Valley, on the south side of the road.

Michael Jackson will be at the show dancing. I'd like to see him rather than just sitting and doing nothing. My cousin Archie Weber is by the Elgins house on the southeast corner of the intersection of 1st Street and Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. He tells me to pull off to the sidewalk. I do. There are broken sunglasses on the ground, but none that are good enough to wear. Archie is checking for a parking space near there which is why he wants me to wait."

I hear faint voice in my sixth grade teacher Sherry Devine's room. I don't want to interrupt the people, so I go to the bathroom. There is a tiger in the bathroom. It is huge and strong but gentle. There is a dog with antlers tied to its head. There are two cats, one of which is nice and the other mean. The mean cat climbs up my leg and scratches me. I grab it by the back of the neck and hold it, like I am choking it. I go out of the bathroom and find my name and coat rack underneath it. I'm near the door, I think, because my teachers have always seen me as being responsible enough to be away from the teacher's coat rack. I put the battery charger on my coat rack. The coat rack of an acquaintance of mine named Debbie Oliver is next to mine. Debbie and Sherry Devine walk out of the room. Debbie is starting 6th grade at Carter School. Sherry has some very crisp waffles. She says I can go eat with the others. The others have left."

I'm getting set up with a woman who is a friend of a female friend of mine. I sit up and talk with my friend, and the woman comes. There is a lot going unspoken. The woman and I are supposed to have a sexual encounter in a dream. She may not want to do this. She is attracted to me, but may not want to have a sexual encounter with me because I do that in my dreams. The woman has blond hair and her name is Lucy. She is talkative and kind of annoying. She reminds me of my classmate Rachel Thompson. I sit up to talk. I make an attempt to be social and go through the courting process, though I am not comfortable doing so. We're outside a bar. There are some men from Brimson there who recognize me. They are baseball players. I vaguely recognize them and say hi. One of them looks like my classmate John Thomas. The man from Brimson that I met in the Big Resort Area at Fishing Haven is there, and I say hi to him. There are other people outside the bar are giving away dead fish beer and eating raw fish. Some of the fish have a huge eye on their side. There is a white limousine with baseball players in it parked nearby. Another white limousine being driven by a drunken baseball player crashes into the parked limousine. I think that the crash will cost a lot. I walk with Lucy down metal grate steps of what seems to be a baseball stadium. I ask her if she writes down her dreams. She says yes, and I am surprised! I tell her I have 10 dream journals full of dreams. We buy pizza. Fist we go to one little shop where it costs a lot and the employee is rude. Then we go to another shop. The pizza costs $1 a slice. Then it is two slices for $1. I ask the man if I can exchange half a slice for a piece, since it's two for $1. The pizza that is $1 a slice tastes good. The pizza that is two slices for $1 isn't very good: thin, unmelted cheese, and small. My grade school classmate Jerry Kasper is there. He talks about an eye mask that he wears which enhances vision. He says he uses it for bowling and hockey. His vision is pretty vivid and crazy when he uses it for hockey."

We pull in and the place looks different. I see that the towboat dock has moved. A man I worked with, Tom Olson, tells me that they now get off work at 4:00pm all the time. I go in the store.

He fakes tossing a yellow stringer in a package at me, then picks up a new leech locker. He says I really put Gene and Marie in a bad situation. By this he means that I really treated them badly. I don't know what he is talking about. He pulls out a small tape measure and measures the distance above the door to the office, wall to wall. I tell him I don't know what he's talking about, and that he should tell me what he means because I'm sure there's an explanation for it because I've never done anything wrong or bad to Gene and Marie. He says it's about a Mad River catalog. I understand him to be implying that I stole the catalog. Gene, Marie, Mike, and Phoebe all think I stole it. I go berserk! I didn't take the catalog. Phoebe says that maybe I \"extendedly borrowed\" the catalog, using a euphemism for theft. I tell them angrily and firmly that I didn't take their catalog and if they think I did they can kiss my ass! My former coworker Amy Rancher is there. She says, \"Yeah, Kenneth...

There is a white cloth hanging from the top of the doorway with brown writing on it. The writing advertises sales in the store. I go in and meet Phoebe and ask her for my mail. She jokes about what I wrote in my letter to them. She says I wrote that I should \"get payment\" rather than \"receive payment\", which to her would be saying that I should pay. She understood what I meant, though, and will pay me. I go to their office, which is smaller and not as nice looking. She gives me a $100 bill and an extra $20, a big sheet of stamps, and a little sheet of four stamps. Then she says something about not coming back here or to Lakeville with Morris (a moose), or Doris (a duck), or Boris (a bear). I think she is telling me not to ever come on Fishing Haven property again. But then she says that people have been leading the animals back here. I laugh, and say, \"Okay, I won't\". I tell them we're going out on Eagle Lake. Knowing there are no permits for the Big Resort Area, they ask if we're going to Lakeland National Forest. I make a quick recovery and say yes, which implies that we won't go off Eagle Lake into the Big Resort Area and that we aren't camping. One of the men in our group comes up behind me. I don't recognize him at first, but then I do and introduce him to Phoebe and Mike ad my cousin Darren King. They say they'll probably come check on us. I know this is to make sure that we don't go anywhere without a permit, and that they are being sticklers. I hate this about them, but don't say anything. I leave and walk out to the road through trees and on grass, like an apple orchard. My brother Wally is with me. We run back to the car at the Eagle public landing.

We pull one in every few seconds, as fast as we can. I think Franco catches a walleye, and then I see it is a salmon. He lets the other man fish. The boat starts to veer off course. I turn the throttle down and keep it on course. The fish have dark eyes. Something happens to a stringer we are using. We come up to a 94-foot long semi truck trailer. The stringer is being attached to it. I am under the trailer by the middle wheels. Someone is by the back wheels too. I'm scared and nervous. I feel like I'm strapped to the bottom of the trailer. I feel the weight of the trailer on my back and legs as the driver hooks it up. We are hooking up another trailer, weighing 150 tons. I'm really anxious. I see the semi truck back up and the trailer creaks because of its immense weight and pressure. I get hooked up. I squeeze out of where I am and go around the back of the trailer where the driver is. There is a Greyhound bus there. People on the bus come out dressed in winter clothes like they are cold. The driver tells me he wants me to keep riding under the trailer. There is a set of wheels that he drops down a notch; they are closer to the ground now, almost touching. This will give me more room. He tells me I have to learn how to drive the bus that he is driving and that I'm under. He is in a bad mood: sick and tired of driving. I tell him no problem, if he'll teach I'll drive. I realize when I say this that I legally probably shouldn't' be driving a bus full of people. If anything happens, he'll be liable."

I look on the white sheet and there is a note that has something to do with me. I ask my boss Phoebe Mills what it is for. She points to a purple bag that is in the locker at the desk. The bag has my name on it. She tells me some books of mine are there. I look next to the back and pull out my Historical Geology book, \"On Dreams\" by Sigmund Freud, and a brown file folder with copies of my 1996 tax returns in it. I walk out back and into the driveway with my friend Jerry Parsons. There are red gas cans all over, like the six-gallon gas can I bought for my truck. The cans are full of gas. I go over to the towboats with two gas cans, one of which I've taken the cap off of. The customers look like they're ready to go so I put the cans down and put the cap back on the one. My boss Mike Hollow is coming over, and I feel like I shouldn't have the cap off it. There are two women getting tows. There is one woman and one canoe in each boat. One canoe is black. Tom is driving the boat on the right, with the more attractive of the two women. He warms up his motor. The woman in my boat moves back and warms up the motor. The boat drifts back towards shore, and I think the prop may hit the lake bottom so I move the boat forward a bit. Everyone is ready to go, but I need to grab a flannel shirt for the ride. Tom says he'll drive my boat out to the end of the dock so it will be ready to go. I run up and grab a shirt. I run back on the big dock, past Gene and Marie, and get into the boat. Gene and Marie know that I've quit. I think they look down on me for it, but I don't care: I know what I'm doing, and am competent. I set the boat cushion on top of the red seat that is in the boat. I can't pull-start the engine. It is in neutral, and the cord is really hard to pull! I try to start it but I can't. I find the choke and open it by flipping a switch halfway. I pull the cord and the motor doesn't start. I open the choke all the way by moving the switch to the left. The motor is square and much larger than the one I'm used to using. I get it started. My high school classmate John Kulik walks out on the dock. He knows I'm there. I pull the boat away from the dock, ignoring him. We leave. Near the opening to the bay Tom's boat slows down and stops. I see the brake lights for his boat and the cars in front of it. I can't stop in time without hitting his boat, so I pull of to the right of his boat onto the shore. I hop out of the boat with one foot. The motor is still running, but I don't think it has hit the lake bottom. I push the boat along easily with one foot. I'm in a sandy area. People are there. We get off track a bit, and will need to find the trail since we got off course."

I hurry down the stairs outside: I don't want anyone to know I'm leaving. I look for my truck, but can't see it at first. I'm not sure where I parked. I walk down the road to find it. There is a very pale woman with whitish blond hair who calls me over and tells me that back near or at the apartment there is a cat that got nailed down. I think I should go help it. I see my truck. I'm going to get my truck and go back to help the cat. The woman says she's going to go help the cat, so I run for my truck to leave so I'm not near the apartment. The woman runs after me. I stop and turn around. I'm confused, startled, nervous, and scared about why she is following me. I don't know why she would follow me. I realize I must be dreaming. I punch a yellow truck. Instead of my hand going through the truck, as I expected, it hits the truck. I tell the woman she is a part of my dream and ask her what she represents. She doesn't answer. She becomes a spirit: non-tangible but visible. I engulf her, consuming her, integrating her. I walk on and see my mom. I tell her she is in my dream and ask what part of the dream she represents. She doesn't answer. I engulf her, consuming her, as well. I see three women. We are on the hill of 1st Street just west of Slope Avenue in Oak Valley. I stalk them, taking my time, poised.

I'm on the ice, or the boy is I. We go in line and do a drill, zigzagging across the ice. I don't have skates on. I jump up as high as I can and try to touch the rafters. At the end of the drill I do better, and I kick a puck in a goal with my skate. I go off the ice. The hockey coach is the short girls assistant basketball coach at Armstrong High School. I don't like him. I say to him, \"Fuck you!\" He gets right next to me, and we argue. I quit. I punch him. He says he should punch me. I tell him if he punches me I'll sue. He punches or slaps me, but I'm not bothering to do anything about it. I walk across the rink wearing my shoes to get my stuff to leave. I have a locker with my stuff in it. My high school classmates Binky Ahmed, Olie Kecker, Arnie Heller, and Brett Ball are there. The coach is near me. I tell Binky his dream is about \"being filled with hot air\" from the coach! Binky is friendly to me. He asks me what I've been doing since I've been back. I tell him I've been reading, pretty much from the time I go to bed until the time I get up.

I tell him to call and give me his phone number. I go back to the truck, which seems to be a maroon mini-van like Fishing Haven's mini-van. I see that Sam got into the truck through the window, which is rolled down halfway, and then unlocked the door. I know he went for a ride and put gas in the truck, because there is more gas now then there was before."

I win, and so does my friend Niles Zelling. We each get a check for $147.50 from a woman. I think we get a \"trifecta\", or the first three finishers correct. The woman says that we actually won $647.50, but since we didn't pay a damage deposit we don't get the other $500. I start to protest that she forgot to ask us to pay the damage deposit but she gets defensive and angrily stubborn. Then I understand that we aren't getting the rest of the money because we didn't pay a damage deposit: I didn't understand that at first. I'm going to a job interview. I walk by many Juicy Poultry Corporation semi truck trailers. I write \"KMHanson\" on some of them. I seem to be over on Cemetery Drive where Preppy Printers used to be in Oak Valley. I walk in a large warehouse. People are processing spinach. There are large square vats of spinach being thawed out. I walk, and think I am headed for a workshop-like room with tools and junk everywhere. Maybe I'll meet the man there. I am near Kentucky Fried Chicken, and then it seems I am in the Ace Hardware store. I call the man on the phone. My interview is at Kentucky Fried Chicken. The man asks me if I'm aware that we're scheduled to have a personal interview, not a phone interview. He is annoyed that I'm calling and am not there in person. He is a jerk. I'm on my way. I hear someone other than myself talking to him on the phone. The person says they are coming from Fishing Haven and will be there for the interview soon. The man just wants the person to be there, period. The person talking says they can leave their job early. This person is supposed to be me. The man gets mad when the person says that, because strict employment, jobs, and hours are important to him. I say to him on the phone that everyone has to decide sometime: has to make a choice. I'm walking out the back exit of Carter School talking on a red cordless phone as I say this. The phone belongs to Fishing Haven. I walk down the alley towards 2nd Street. I run and try to hide the phone. It seems that Fishing Haven is in Carter School and I don't want my former employers to see me with their phone. I will return it later. I walk and run through yards. I'm wearing blaze orange. I think and speak in terms of risks and benefits as I walk though yards, over fences, and by people. I seem to be going west, towards home. I think people will be able to see me from a long ways away because of my blaze orange."

Some of her friends come, sit on my left for a bit, and then leave. They are getting their hair cut. A woman comes and sits on my left, across from the person, who then is Jenny. Jenny introduces the woman and I. Her name is Kari Johnson. I say to Kari, nonchalantly, \"Didn't we sit next to each other in 7th grade?\" She says that we did. I tell her I had a dream a couple weeks ago about our 7th grade classmate Kelly Furlong. Kari thinks I am dreaming about Kelly because I'm attracted to her. She doesn't understand what a dream means to me.  In this place there is a disagreement and arguing over an accident or a fight: who is guilty, who is to blame? People gather inside the place. There is tension. My friend Kevin Simpson is there and talks about guilt. He doesn't blame himself, which I think is unusual because he's always sacrificing himself. Instead he blames my brother Wally. I think that though the fault lies somewhere, much of this should go blameless. The situation arose because of the circumstances, for which no one is to blame. My friend Stephen Ramos is outside. I go outside to avoid the conflict. I listen through the window, but don't want anyone to know I'm listening. I try to sneak back around front without them knowing I was eavesdropping. Inside there is a small crowd. My dad is there. I imagine a fight. I would support my dad if someone started trouble with him: someone would have to deal with me first, and I consider myself to carry a considerable amount of strength and power. There are two yellow school buses on the corner near the place where we are. One bus is rolling towards the other. Someone yells for me to put a package or a bunch of cheap white razors in a hold on the inside of the front of the moving bus, so when the buses collide they will explode. I run into the bus, put the razors in the hold, and quickly exit the bus. Main Street in Wilmerton is packed with cars. The police arrive, driving their cars on the median. The place we are at seems to be the glass store near McDonalds. I walk west on Main Street. I want to get away so that the police don't question me about the incident. I walk in my underwear. My face is scarred and torn up. Men are crowding the sidewalks and street. This seems to be a Men's Fest. Many of the men are holding a can of beer. There is a man hitting baseballs on the St. Mary's Church field. All the men are supposed to get to do this. They walk across Main Street and traffic stops. There are a few thousand men. I walk through them. I don't want to be a part of Men's Fest. I see pencil drawings on white paper as I walk. Some of these are large. Most of the drawings are of men and women. I know I had a drawing done, but I don't' know with who or where it is now. As I walk the back of my underwear may drop down, exposing my butt. I want to be away, to escape the police. I think of different routes I can take. Cutting through yards is probably the most clandestine route. I think it will be difficult cutting across the Thru Highway out in the open: the police would see me."

I see my friend Kevin Simpson, who has really short hair. He works at the hospital. To have some fun, he leads us down a stairway to the basement where we exit out of a garage door into a parking lot area between buildings. We need to shut the garage door. Tom is close to it, but is too short, so I go back and close it. Kevin leads us to another building for which he has the key. Five security lights go on outside the building as we approach it. We scramble for cover, but not too frantically. I lean up against a wall to get out of the open. Tom runs away. Kevin, Nat, and I go into the building. We go up stairs and down hallways, just running around. We see security guards coming in their cars. It is now the daytime. I'm in front of the others. We scramble down stairs. Kevin directs me, but I don't know all the doors. We get to the first floor and go out the door on the other end of the building.

I see my grade school secretary Angie Sacks go into the bathroom on the right, so I look above the doorway to see how they are labeled. I go into the men's room, which is on the left. There are showers with a wall obscuring the shower stalls. A hallway is visible. I seem to be at Brimson. Women are in the bathroom. My grade school classmate Annette Smith is defecating in a stall without a door. My classmate at Brimson Laura Robinson is urinating in a stall. I think that's odd sine she is a woman, but maybe she has a penis. I urinate in a stall. I wash my hands well afterward with soap and water. A person is putting a small ball of garbage in the trashcan. The ball has some red stuff on it, which I think may be menstrual blood, and I find that aversive. Angie Sacks and my brother's grade school classmate Shelly Jenson are in the bathroom. I walk out past the showers and get a glimpse of Shelly and my classmate Sarah Miller standing, drying off after a shower. I try to do a task separating two wife beater tank tops and something else, but I can't do it or I have trouble. I walk out of the bathroom. My grade school classmates Kari Otis and Misty Ryan walk towards me. Misty is telling Kari about some of her dreams. They are joking around, and we joke and playfully punch each other. Kari then punches Misty hard in the face, which is inconsistent with the playing that had been occurring: it was malicious! Misty is hurt, and taken back. Kari apologizes to Misty, but it is not a genuine apology. Kari is mad and was expressing real anger and aggression in that punch. My high school classmate Linus Doman is there. I say that Kari punching Misty hard would be like me punching Linus. I have a pair of glasses with lenses five or six inches in diameter. They are candy, and I try to eat them. The glasses are so big they'd be more easily eaten if they were in pieces. I go into a class on sex roles, which seems to have something to do with my economics professor Zoe Madden.

Off the side of the hotel quite high up is a platform that extends 25 or 30 out from the building. It is all enclosed and finished off. This is Alcatraz. The platform has a satellite dish on it, pointing upwards. It sends out small waves and gets the waves back when they are larger. The platform ledge is used for high-class business or social functions. In the building there is a large round elevator with a hole in the middle: donut shaped. People stand where the cake part of the donut would be. The elevator is about 70 feet in diameter and holds a couple hundred people. It goes up and down many floors of the building very fast, but gently.  I am in a round green room. There is a woman there on the other side of the room, and others. The class of 1997 from Brimson is in the elevator, and they enter the room we are in from a metal hatch door on the floor. They walk up and in like the elevator is below the room we are in. Alec Johnson is among them. He talks to another woman about Josh Lanky, my high school classmate. Alec says that Josh is a good guy. The class is going to watch a movie in the room. A woman I know comes up to me and says I have to move because the class will be sitting where I am. I hop off the table I'm sitting on and she sits down there. I realize that this exact scenario of the woman telling me to move has happened to me previously in a dream. In that dream I told the woman to eat shit, and wouldn't move. In this case, I moved. I go sit by the woman I know. The room doesn't fill up: not all the graduates come. The areas near the walls are occupied but the center of the circular room is largely empty. The people and I watch a movie on a big screen. My friend Tiny Combs is there. In the movie there is a black man who gets electrocuted and dies. He is digging, mining, and connects two wires together. The two other free ends of the wires touch his feet, completing a circuit, and he gets shocked. He is alive later, and a woman straddles him; they have sex.  There is a round brick vertical tunnel about 10 feet in diameter. Next to the tunnel is a ledge. There are some metal bars extending both out from and across the tunnel. There is a round concrete platform, about two feet in diameter, that moves up and down in the tunnel. I am hanging on the bars. My friends Tiny and Nate Nelling are there, also hanging. We have to let go of the bar, land on the platform, ride it a little ways, and then jump and grab onto the bar again. There is a snarkel there. The snarkel is a little man who lives in this deep, dark tunnel. The tunnel is very deep and dark. At the bottom the tunnel curves and becomes horizontal: the tunnel is actually U-shaped. It may go back up on another side. The snarkel says that he fell to the bottom of the tunnel once. It took one and a half years for the platform to come down so he could jump on it. At the bottom of the tunnel, at the bottom of the U-shape, there is a light. The rest of the tunnel is dark. The platform will make it to the bottom sometime, but we don't know when. The platform moves where it needs to go, where people need to go. One needs to jump on it while its' moving. My friend Tim Zelling is there. We hang on the bars. Someone tries to use a fishing net to help me and one of the other guys move from the bar that we're hanging on, like we are supposed to step in the net or onto the metal edges of the net. The net isn't strong, though, and it won't hold. I want to jump from the bar, pushing off from the wall with my feet and legs, and land on the ledge without using the platform. This is dangerous. I might not make it and would fall down into the deep dark stone tunnel. I get ready to jump. I tell Tim not to grab me too soon or I'll lose the jumping momentum. I'm aiming for a metal support bar on the corner of the ledge. I hope I can jump and grab onto it! I have to be careful when I jump not to hit my head on another bar farther out in the tunnel."

I go out into the large, wide hallway. There are many doors. I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to go into. I walk down the hallway, looking into rooms. One room is large and empty: classroom-like, and has religious artifacts around it. I wonder if it's a good idea to ejaculate in that room. I'm near the end of the hallway.

I leave, and walk back down the hall to the office area. There are several famous movie stars in a room: a man and a couple women. A woman was raped earlier, though she didn't realize it.

He finds our orientation, and we head southeast, to make a loop in the time we have. We're using his Grumman canoe. There are two yellow canoes ahead of us that make it to the portage before us.

After the first game we're supposed to play a second game. Niles questions whether this is a good idea because we have a basketball game later that day, and he thinks we'll have more Frisbee games later as well when our players show up, because we'll keep winning (as if it's a tournament). My high school classmate Buck Green shows up for out team's second game. We play. The other team kicks off. I receive the kick off, which is a football. I catch it in a fishing net after it bounces, and sloppily throw the net and ball to Niles, who is behind me, when the other team approaches. A tall red-haired man that I know from Brimson defends me, and I defend him. The other team then has the Frisbee. I hold the man, giving him cheap shots, the whole game. While I do this I ask him if there is a rule against holding, even though I know there is. He says there is a rule, but it's not called holding, rather _____ (I forget). When we get the Frisbee he defends me cleanly and very well. He is a very good player, much better than myself. The other team scores easily. It seems I am only on offense at the first kickoff, and then am on defense the whole time. They have the Frisbee on the sidelines for a throw-in. The player I'm guarding, who is my former roommate Sean Williams, rolls an entry pass instead of throwing the Frisbee to his teammate. The Frisbee rolls like a wheel. Sean and I both chase it. He is faster than I, and picks it up. I chase him. There is no one between him and the goal, but he is still a ways from the goal. He is going for the goal, and will probably make it. I dive when he throws the Frisbee, trying to deflect it with my outstretched arm. (I awaken with my right arm outstretched hitting the fan on my floor.)"

We all sing, on cue, at appropriate times. The first line we sing is pretty clear for having so many people singing. The next cue is all jumbled and incoherent. People get in groups and do the hokey pokey. I wonder why they do it the way the do: holding their arms up, bent, touching one hand to the opposite elbow. My sister Ramona, my mom, and my friend Kevin Simpson are there. We're in a circle with others. Ramona does the hokey pokey in the middle and then comes over to me, which means it's my turn to go in the middle.

Fox's character Marty in the movie Back To The Future. No one really likes my dance. Kevin is next. He moves a stone on the floor with his head, and then kicks it to me. I kick it back.

I stand up in the bathtub and start to yell at the judge. I throw a drill bit-like piece of metal and some utensils. I am enraged at being accused and vindicate myself. I seem to work at the place I am, and I now quit my job and walk out. I get to the Redding farm porch where Oprah Winfrey and another prominent black woman are. I tell them as I nearly break down in tears, that \"He thinks I told a racist joke but I didn't! I'm not racist!\" They console me and we walk outside. I say I need to be alone, and I run off feeling very frustrated and agitated. I'm near 3rd Street and Home Avenue in Oak Valley on the sidewalk. The \"oppressors\" are at Carter School. It's winter. I run with a t-shirt on. I get to the hill at the bottom of our alley. A tow truck drives down the alley and skids quickly to a stop in the show so it doesn't hit a vehicle coming up the hill on 2nd Street. I walk towards home and think about drawing this dream for the afternoon and not going back to school at Carter School. I feel in control of the situation. I have the upper hand on the people involved."

I'm then in my underwear, and the man changes back into his clothes: he is done for the day. I am worried that I may get an erection. The man leaves and my female coworkers enter the room. They are jealous that I got to perform liposuction on my first day with no training. They all have to wait a while before than can do that. I play the whole thing down, and try to change the topic of conversation. Some Asian people walk by the opened door. They are dressed in karate guys. I lie on the table and stick out my belly, pretending that I need liposuction. My coworkers brush me off, sillily, saying I am foolish for thinking that, even though I'm joking around. Our manager, who is an Asian woman, comes in and catches us loafing around. She gets mad at us and punches everyone out on the time clock. I talk to her and ask her if we don't even get a break.

I go look at a time clock on the side of a building. There is no time card for me. I take a card that is someone else's, and put I back. All the new time cards are inside the clock and I can't get at them. I walk away. Some men from Brimson walk by, including a man named Brad from my music class. I then see my brother Wally and classmate Melvin Dahlheimer. I hug Melvin, and then go up to Wally. Wally extends his hand, and I hug him, both joking and seriously. We're near Carter Church. I'm wearing my green parka. Wally, Melvin, and others are going to Mason Cafeteria to eat: they live on campus. I tell them they should stop by.

I think of going to Jefferson School or the Hill Park shelter where there would be something to block the rain. We stop on the road, pulling over, to take a photograph of a fabulous sunset: it's blue and orange and yellow or pink, in concentric circles on the horizon. A vehicle pulls up, and my high school math teacher Ray Banks gets out. He walks towards us and goes into the outhouse that is next to us on the side of the road. I say hi to him as he passes. I aim my camera at the sunset. Through the shutter I see a list or chart of all the really big (20 pounds or more) northern pike that my grandpa Redding has caught. I then see different parts of grandpa, and I take a photograph of him lying on a table having surgery, in which a metal tool is being removed from his stomach. This may be a drill bit. Ray loosened the tie down rope holding the two canoes on our vehicle as he walked by. We'll have to retie it. I don't mind: we'll just have to redo it, but Ray seems bad about it. After I take the photograph my film rewinds. I open the back and the roll of film has a piece of the starter strip sticking out, like it's a new roll, even though it's used up. I think this must be because after it was rewound I turned the camera \"on\" again before removing the old film, so it advanced again. Ray Banks is then grandpa Redding, and he walks to his old blue car, which he says is a '66, and still running. I tell him my truck only has 50,000 miles. HE comes over and looks at the odometer, which reads 57,xxx. My dad is there. We think of leaving the car and riding bicycles. I think of my brother Wally's road bicycle in the basement at home.

It is strung up on the dock. It is a walleye, I think, but has a huge mouth and is gray and black in color. Niles landed a big eight or 10-pound northern pike. Tim hooks into one on the dock. I go out and net it as he gets in near. Niles' fish is in the net, and then I net Tim's. It is also a big pike: six or eight pounds. We're happy when I net the second fish: we got two big ones! They hold their big pike up and I take a photograph. I am confused as to who caught which fish."

At the bottom of the steps is the wreckage from Diana's accident. There is a bullet hole in the wreckage that glows orangish-gold in color. All the wreckage fades black, but I see the bullet hold that looks like this: [diamond shape], but with rounded side edges, keeping the top and bottom edges pointy. I know her death has been a murder. I walk out the front or hour house. I'm leery of things because of the murder. A car pulls up along the curb. I'm leaving, but am suspicious of it so I go over to see what the man wants. The man sticks his head out of the sunroof and says he wants \"pows\", which I know are caffeine pills. I say, \"Okay, pull over.\" He doesn't pull over right away. When he does pull over, he runs away. His car is parked in the front driveway behind my truck. I threaten to push it back into the street by backing into it with my truck, if he doesn't come here. He is the \"crazy paintbrush man\", I know. He runs all over our yard and house. I chase him, yelling out for others to help me. Ramona, my mom, and grandpa Redding all see me chasing him and yelling for help to stop him. I chase him over past our neighbor's house. I jump on their porch and run across it, chasing him. He is dangerous: I see him as loony, unstable, and threatening. We all chase him. I catch him with help from others. Ramona and I corner him by a tree, and a clothesline is there. I get tangled up in the clothesline as I try to grab him, especially the little finger on my right hand. I catch him. He talks about catching a big northern pike. I rip him apart: he is a clothespin. I eat him, chewing up the clothespin, chewing up the metal and the wood. He is a crazy, dancing, loony, happy man: a fruitcake!"

He turns his back on others and I for money. His younger brother, who is black, also does this. They betray others and I. I'm quick to point my finger at Norman for what he's done. Something happens with a boat on shore that needs to be pulled up farther. A man is there dressed in light brown. He is an authority, able to punish or deal with Norman. I subdue Norman. I physically hold him, wrapping him up with my arms and legs, so that he can't get away. I obtain Norman's gun, which I put in my back pocket. He is passive. He fells that I'm overreacting and does nothing to try to get away. I get others to help me hunt down and subdue Norman's brother. We're in a very populated area, a big gathering which seems to be in a parking lot. The people there seem to be country folks: hicks. There's a group of teenage girls that think I'm gay. I know this because I have my arm around Norman. Others and I sneak around, trying to spot Norman's brother, who is at large. This whole time I have my arms and legs wrapped around Norman so he won't get away. I see his brother cross an opening and alert others to this. We all pursue him. He may have a hostage, who is my high school classmate Nelson Eastman. The brother has a gun. My classmates Tim Zelling and Sherman Andrews help me follow him. I haul Norman with me. He whines about money and drugs. I say to him that he can have all the marijuana and the money: it's not about that! He says, \"Damn! I sold burgers for a buck!...\" He is trying to get sympathy. All that he values is money: he just doesn't get it. Sherman finds Norman's brother on the roof of a building. Sherman tells me the brother has a gun, and he is crying, like he has given up. I yell for others to go get him, but I don't go myself. No one wants to confront his brother, so I go. I release Norman to Sherman, who will hold him. I remember I have his gun in my back pocket. I take it out. I feel powerful with the gun. I point it at the ledge above me where the roof is, as I climb a ladder up to the roof. I'm anxious, nervous, and scared when I climb. I realize I've been a hypocrite in telling others to go get him, not doing it myself."

It is as if I am preventing him from doing this, even though I'm not sitting at the end.

Lyle doesn't really want me to sit there: he doesn't like me. I think our classmate John Kulik may be there as well. There is great tension and mistrust among us because of the fear that one will cheat. We're not friends. It's a greedy atmosphere: everyone, including me, for themselves. To begin, I pull out a handful of chips from my pocket. I didn't pay for them. They are extra chips, but no one knows that so I take them as mine, cheating. The first hand is dealt, and all the cards are face up. The game is five-card stud. I get dealt a straight, and I pick up my cards like I would to play a regular hand. They guy before me bets one chip. I'm unsure about how this game is being played. I have six cards. There is a wildcard too, which changes with each player. In my case the wildcard is a five. I have three 6's, which I think is a pretty good five-card stud hand. If I can go out by using five of the six cards in my hand, I win, and get the pot. I lay down my 5's and 6's. I think I'll have five 6's and will blow everyone away. But I have only four 6's when I get them down, which is still an unreal hand, but I didn't use all five cards. I pick them back up, and everyone knows I have a good hand, once again (they saw the straight I was dealt initially). I manage to make a straight out of my hand by going Ace-6-2-3-4-5, where fives are wild. I know this isn't legal, but no one catches it. If I were to use the five as a two, then the six wouldn't match up after the four, and I would need to use six cards. I win. There is a feeling that I have betrayed all the guys. Lyle won't hand me the cards, even though it's my turn to deal. He puts them under the table. I criticize and yell at him for this. My mom offers to deal a round of hands for everyone, but the guys don't like this."

She hasn't, I think. I tell her we sold a lot of tickets last night. By that I mean we sold a lot of cups for beer at our house party. My uncle Rusty Redding is there smoking a cigarette. I give my dad the babies, which are now each in a tennis shoe. They are small. I can't see them when I look into the shoe, but can only see the clothes surrounding them. I pay the woman with a $5 bill. She gives me $2 in change. I hear the buzzer: the game has started. I'm wearing either snow boots or roller blades. I run into the gymnasium, going down the hall past the maintenance area. The hallway opens up into the gymnasium after a quick left turn. As I enter one team shoots a three-pointer from what would be out-of-bounds, on the other side of the backboard. It goes in and is counted. There is a large space of about 30 feet between the bleachers and the court. I sit by myself on the second row of the \"student\" section. I see my cousins Rich, Melvin, and Melissa Redding. Armstrong does well. My old neighbor Tim Robbins and another kid yell at me to come sit with them up near the top of the bleachers. I do this, though I'd rather sit by myself. Next to us are two guys doing the Rocker High School basketball radio show. Armstrong does well, and we cheer. Several parents who seem to be from Rival High School look up at us with disdain. They frown on us and look down upon us, maybe because we vocally support the team. Two of them are my old teammate's father, Todd Kecker, and a person from Rival High School, Alex Zadra. I go down and sit right next to them: in the middle of them. I ask them why they're being so belligerent. I sit and talk with them, calmly. They don't want me there. The two people are not Todd and Alex, but two men I don't know. The game we're watching is a junior varsity game between Rapidville and Holy High School, but it seems one game is Armstrong versus Rival. These players are not varsity caliber. I'm confused as to who is who, and which team is which, because I don't recognize anyone. I don't know who to cheer for. My high school friend Sam Kingsley and his old girlfriend Janelle West are there. Sam is a sitting a few rows down from me. He says hi. I feel dumb, as if I had been ignoring him, which I hadn't been: I just didn't know he was there. Had I known, I would have liked to ignore him. I say hi and we talk. He is in school in Metropolis, but not at the community college because they didn't give him enough financial aid. He attends a different school named Boris. He says it's going okay. I tell him to give me his phone number. I express happiness when he tells me his classes are going well, and this surprises him, because he thinks I wouldn't care."

He is going to Hawaii and needs a ride to the airport. My friend Bubba Hacker is there. He and I argue over the directions we are going to give this man on how to get to the airport. Bubba wants to direct him down 19th Avenue, even though there are a lot of stop signs, and actually because there are a lot of stop signs, because he has concerns about the man's driving ability. The man takes a taxi. My advisor Mary Monroe is there. She is the director or boss. My friend Nat Miller is on the side of the road, waiting in a yellow cab. Several people are in the cab with him. He is getting off work, or getting easy work, since he gets to drive the cab. I may be his co-worker. I tell the man it's going to take at least 1.5 hours to get to the airport, which may not be enough time for him since he indicates he needs to be there in 10 minutes. I'm on a school bus with Mary, my friend Norman Noman, and others. A large man asks a question about \"When would be the best time to...?\" I cut him off and say, \"Now\". He was either asking the best time to eat at Dairy Queen or the best time to go to the bathroom. In either case, the answer is now. We all get out of the bus. It costs $3.33 for three Blizzards at Dairy Queen, and one gets a free Blizzard as well, so Norman and I decide to do this and each eat two Blizzards. He gets Heath flavor as his first one and tells the worker to put a lot of Heath in it. I'm getting Heath flavor for one of my two Blizzards as well."

She says something indicating she thinks I'm very sexy. She pulls out a cigarette and asks me for a light. I say I don't smoke, implying that I don't have a light. She says something indicating she thinks it's not cool that I don't smoke. She asks me if I'm allergic to smoke. My nose is stuffed up and running. I wipe my nose and blow my nose a lot, which I think is not cool since there is a physically attractive woman right next to me who is interested in me. I say I might be allergic to smoke but I don't know: I've never been to a doctor for it. I pause before indicating that I haven't gone to a doctor specifically for a smoke allergy. Because I pause, she understands or thinks I'm saying that I've never been to a doctor in my life, period! My friend Norman Noman is there. He thinks that this woman is cute. She asks if anyone wants a glass of water. I say that I'd love one. I think of chewing gum because I haven't brushed my teeth yet today. I kiss the woman. I pull down her pants have sex with her from behind as she bends over. I ejaculate quickly. Then I'm standing on the side of her and I rub her clitoris with my finger. She is then on her back with her legs up and we have sex. When I feel that I'm going to ejaculate I pull my penis out and put it up near her mouth. She gives me fellatio briefly, and I ejaculate into her mouth. She clears her throat loudly and spits the semen out. She isn't tactful and is clearly there just for the sex. When I ejaculated the second time I felt a strong need to urinate, and I may have urinated a small amount immediately following the ejaculation. After I ejaculate I put my penis, which is still erect, back in her vagina and continue thrusting."

It is very calm, still, and peaceful outside. I hear a car coming up the hill on Home Avenue. I walk up onto the porch to get out of view. One the porch I look at tracings or carvings in the snow, almost as if I'm paging though a big book, four feet tall and wide, and on each page is a fresh six-inch layer of snow with something traced into it. I go inside. A man and a woman are on the sidewalk arguing. I try to close the front door, which swings like it's a 270-degree angle-swinging door. The door won't latch. I try to adjust it and shove it closed. The man and the woman, who is his girlfriend, continue to argue. He is forceful, belligerent, and seems to be an abusive man. He batters her. They come into our yard, around back of the house. I get on the phone. It rings where my mom was; my mom is now at church. My aunts Willow and Sherry Redding are at the place where the phone is ringing. One of them picks it up. I'm going to hang up because I didn't intend to call them. But I don't hang up because they may know it is I calling, or I don't want to alarm them. I quickly tell them the problem of the people arguing in our yard, and tell them I'm going to call 911. I run back and lock the old wood back door. It has two locks. The couple argues near the door. My sister Ramona wakes up. I see her scurry across the back yard in fear. I turn the light to the back yard on. Ramona comes into the garage from the outside door. The huge wooden garage door is on the east side of the garage. I try to lock the inside garage door that leads into the kitchen after I take all the keys that are hanging in the garage. The woman who was arguing doesn't want me to call the police, which I am about to do as soon as I get the inside garage door locked. She comes towards me; she is outside the big wooden garage door. She tells me not to call the police, and she says my name. It's tough to get the inside door locked. I pull it tight, slamming it, and it locks. Ramona is ready to go. I run upstairs with the cordless phone, call 911, and grab my boots. A man answers. I tell him people are in our yard fighting, and they're going to the Nodes Of Ranvier. He says calmly that he's dispatching the police now."

I say something like, \"It's the birthday girl.\" I'm flirting with her. She greets me unenthusiastically. This couple is dressed up in Halloween costumes that are supposed to be scary. I walk inside the dorm and turn left to the stairs. There is an infant, a toddler, a baby, and other small children to age four or five. They may be watching television. I scare them inadvertently as I walk by with my barrel. I walk up many old stairs, like I'm in Wonkers Hall, dragging my barrel. I get to the second or third floor and there is a lot of recycling in the stairwell area. There is a garbage can full of glass and a cardboard box of glass. I'm going to try to fit it all in my barrel. There is a small cat there. It is dark in color, thin, and furry. It is very soft and tender. It is roaming around, jumping up at times like it is trying to get out of something. I'm scared of being bitten or scratched by the cat. I want to befriend it because it is cute. I pick it up and put it down after a short time, repeatedly. Two custodial women walk by. They ask something or I say something, and we start talking about my roommate Stephen Ramos. I say he works for the recycling organization. They remember who he is and say, no, that he works for the custodial department. I say okay. I tell them he's my roommate and sometimes I get mixed up because we see each other when we work. I'm covering something up, as if I lied and had to recover."

            "content": "Hammer War  My former coworkers Amy Rancher and Jenny, and a sibling of theirs (they seem to be sisters) are flying back to Hawaii, which may be where they're from. Their father is going too, but he isn't present. It's early morning in the winter, and is dark out, about 2:00 or 3:00am. I drive in my mom's car with Amy and their siblings as if we are getting ready to go to the airport. I drive by the Baseball Pub and then go home. Jenny is not out of bed. She is at a different house than mine. I was supposed to get her but she wasn't awake. They're not leaving yet: not flying out for a day or two. Their father is not with us. I'm at home talking to my mom about arrangements for getting them to the airport. I say to her that I should go and get Jenny, who seems to be in an apartment over by Smith School. This is so she is with us in case they need to leave for Hawaii in a hurry. My mom agrees. I suggest that they all stay at our house tonight, and she again agrees. My motive, which undermines these suggestions, is to have a sexual encounter with Amy. I think Jenny and the siblings can sleep in the living room, head to toe in a square shape, but I want Amy to sleep in my room. She stayed in my room the night before. Their father is there. He has a white and gray beard that is neatly trimmed. He is about 5'8\", and is a sturdy man. Someone is giving dance lessons. This man, my mom, and a small boy are dancing in the kitchen at home. I'm in my Religions In America class. Amy and Jenny are in the class, and are black. The teacher doesn't like them talking, and she reprimands them. Class gets out early. I stay after to talk with the teacher: I am unhappy with her. She is having her photograph taken posing with some items. My friends Fran Susse and Anna Woods are there. It may be the spring semester of 1998, after I have gotten back from my study abroad and Fran is back from her semester off. They ask for my phone number. I give it to them, and say it's the only one they'll ever need. I realize how pretentious that sounds, even though I was just joking.  I'm canoeing with a person in the Big Resort Area. The person may be Ken Blast, my schoolmate at Brimson. He has never been here before. We're on Eagle Lake, but it seems to be a different lake that is more open. We're supposed to meet others, but it is not clear where they will meet us. They are coming later. We come to an area with a brick wall surrounding a swimming pool. I say to him that this isn't what the Big Resort Area is like.  I'm in a garage. I see my friend Kevin Simpson's canoe overhead in the rafters with the paddles stuck in between the seats and cross bars. I think of calling Fishing Haven and asking them to call the place where the others are, to tell them where to meet us. It's Friday the 13th. I'm at some sort of a camp or cabin area with others. Army soldiers come to protect us from bugs. When I first see the soldiers I chuckle: they are here to protect us by killing bugs! We are in a vacation area where there are many couples. Amy and Jenny are there. I know people are going to be killed because it's Friday the 13th. Someone will be killing people one by one, like in the movie. I hope Amy is the last person alive so we can have a sexual encounter. She might be the first person killed. A boy gets killed or mauled from a lawn mower. I'm in shallow water on a beach that is at a considerable incline. It's dark out. Soldiers are near the top of the beach shining lights down towards me. My classmate Eric Dole is among them. I evade their lights. It is then light outside. There is a sign language interpreter there, a group leader, the soldiers, and myself. They all see me. There is some sort of interaction, specifically involving the signer. There is an older man and woman. Something happens with some sort of collar or synthetic strip that may have Velcro. The strip is on the side of a tree, and when it is closed to form a circle like a bracelet some sort of poison is released. By pressing or having this collar-like strip against their neck, the old man and woman die: they're poisoned. The woman's face turns blue, orange, and brown. A boy has a dream of who will be killed next: the third person. The dream predicts that the boy's mother will be killed. His mother stifles the expression of that dream. A large group of soldiers shoot automatic rifles at her. I see a small white figure, which is the mother, and many black dots around her, which are the bullets. One bullet hits her right in the center of the chest. The people retaliate against the killing, and there is a war with the soldiers. I am with the people that are retaliating. One of us throws two red grenade-like objects at the soldiers. An Asian man in a purple suit picks up one grenade and throws it into the water. The second grenade is going to explode, so I take cover from the flames that I know will soon be around my by stepping into a shed. I know the shed will catch fire, and I can go out of it later: I just need to be away from the initial blast. There are a lot of hammers hanging inside the shed. Some of them have nail removers and others have ball heads. I grab them and give my friend Bill Hanson, my mom, and others hammers to fight with. We battle the soldiers. Our opponents also have hammers. I duel with a man: we lock hammers and spar. I hit him repeatedly in the head with a hammer. I think where the most effective place to hit him would be: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, etc. I hit him 15 or 20 times. I feel that he must be in extreme pain. I can't imagine how painful it would be to have your head beat in with a hammer. This man has light colored short hair. Bill fixes the screen and takes the gray plastic tubing off. We laugh: what an odd thing to do in a time of war! At some point I'm taking off the magnetic disk on my compact disc changer while Amy and Jenny look on."

There are many young people there. My grade school classmate Gino Teavor is there sitting next to our other classmate Eric Stoner. My junior high classmate Tara Gosling is there. There is food and Grain Belt Premium Beer. People are all sitting around on the floor and on chairs. The Premium looks to be gone. I find a bottle of it. I open the bottle and it starts to foam over, so I suck the foam up. I can't suck all the foam, and some overflows onto a white plastic bag. Two younger men are hiding beers in their pockets. I scold them: there is not enough to go around. They seem immature and overly ambitious to drink. I sit on the floor in front of the chairs. My friends from Brimson Emerald Reinhold, Holly Lapson, and Terry Foss walk by. I say hi to them, with my usual degree of discomfort in their presence. The meeting starts. The president of the Honor Society is a nutty man! He is a physically small man with long straight brown hair. He tells bad jokes. He talks bout hanging black hair. Three black men who are in the audience mock the president for what he says, as if he knows nothing. The president says something about black hair being a mole's vagina. There is a white woman with blond hair in the back of the room. I know she is there. She is a leader of some sort: someone with power. I try to look mature when she can see me. I don't want to seem immature in front of her. I have lost my beer. It may be somewhere but I can't find it, or I decide which one it is from the others on the table. A couple of people run up to the front of the room with beer. As they hold a box, a tear it open and grab a beer. It is a big can of Heineken. I crack it open and drink a lot, though I don't slam it. There is an Asian man there who wants me to share my beer with him. I let out a loud cheer for the beer, and feel immature for doing so."

The man there is out of cooked bratwurst, so I wait for two to be cooked. They are cooking in oil. I tell the man I'm going shopping and I'll come back for the bratwurst when they're done, even though I've already paid for them. He says okay. He has a water pump that squirts a thin stream of fluid. I ask if it's okay to leave my backpack there while I shop. He says okay. But I realize I'm leery of leaving my back because I have my dream journal in it. I also see my Paleontology notebook in my stuff. I walk towards the entrance. I see my dad in the parking lot pushing a boat with a wheel on the front. He has a beard. When I get near the door there are two huge white vehicles with huge open spaces, which are beds, in them. I ask the man what they are for, and he says they are leaf carriers for the city. I go inside. I need a grocery cart. An old lady wants Cinnamon Bran cereal. I point out it to her where it is. She pulls a whole pallet out with Kix cereal on it. I push the pallet back. Small boxes of Kix are only $1.39. I buy some, as well as some laundry detergent. A man who works for Grocery Getto is standing around the items for sale. He's wearing a white shirt and maybe a tie. I see some Big Resort Area food packs, gear, and equipment packs for sale. There is also rain gear and a tarp. I think I should buy some of it. I know that Drummonds Incorporated runs a lot of covert pornography, and that I could expose them and absolutely ruin their business."

My mom says I can borrow her car to drive to Wilmerton; I'm in Woodland now. My mom may go with, as well as Wally. I'm outside a building with my dad. We're gathering before the funeral. My dad makes very sexual comments, including one about me being with virgins. This seems indecent and it makes me uncomfortable. We wait for my cousins Anna and Bertha Strange to arrive. They do. I'm inside a building, which may be a church, at a funeral. People march in, carrying the coffin, and everyone files into pews. I sit in a pew with the Redding family, including grandma, Sherry and Joanne Redding, and others. It's very crowded so I move back one pew and sit by myself. The funeral service that takes place is a Jewish service, and it is happening before the service that I am there to attend, for the Comb's father. Grandma Redding offers me some hallucinogenic mushrooms. I decline them. Sherry speaks: she is slow and shaky, like Grandma. My dad is sitting next to me.

My aunt Willow Redding is there, as well as my aunt and uncle Sheila and Rusty Redding and their kids Melvin, Rich, and Melissa. We all sit down at a picnic table and eat. It seems at first that the Redding's are the Ryan family. The Ryan's have brought fresh cucumbers, long and red tomatoes, and onions. I make a burger and put onion on it. Then I squeeze out the inside of an onion onto the burger, like the onion is squeezable jelly. It may be a rotten onion. Melvin has gotten something removed from his neck and he says something like, \"How could I have ever known it was there with my head?!\" We are eating in a porch-like area that is enclosed in glass. I see my friend Bubba Hacker and his sister Roberta arrive. They get something to eat. They are wearing matching cowboy-like outfits with sheathed knives on their belts. I knock on the window to get their attention, but they don't hear me. I go over to see Bubba. I walk in the Uptown mall parking lot, going from the north/northwest corner by the photography studio to the west side of the north lot, past the break in the wood fence where the bicycle path comes in. I yell \"Sluuu\" to Bubba. He is at a picnic table with others. I walk up and my high school classmates Jack Miller and John Glint. I greet them and we shake hands. Jack is still playing football. I tell them all I just came over to say hi, and I'll come back when I'm finished eating. I walk back and am in a casino-type area. I pick up quarters off a pink carpet. I keep seeing more quarters, and pick them up. People around me aren't picking them up. A woman who works at the casino comes up to me and says that the quarters aren't real and are for graduates only. She comes with a tray to take all the coins back that I've picked up. I clandestinely dump out a partial handful by my right shoe so that she may not see them and I'll get to keep them. I dump the rest in her tray. She tells me there are only three real quarters that she has added to all these coins, the rest are not real. I'm belligerent, and I go right up next to her face. She is a small woman. I use my size to my advantage. She deals with me, briefly explaining, and I go away saying that she has no sense of humor. I walk in an office area back to the place where my family was eating. I go into a room where they are. The casino woman is working right next door in an adjacent room. She says I don't have a sense of humor. I brush her off, but I know she is right. I was mean when I acted belligerent over the coins. The Redding's have left. My mom is there with some of my siblings."

She goes down to the car and waits for Linda and I to come out. Linda wants to get ready and take a shower before we go. I direct her to the attic upstairs, which is where the attic is. I think very sexual thoughts about Linda. She arranges the space in the attic for a shower. She and I are then near the kitchen sink. I'm standing behind her with my arms around her. I tell her I'm attracted to her. I put my hands on her stomach and lick her ear. She says we could be intimate. I go to the bathroom to defecate and tell her I'll come up to the shower later (so we can have sex). I go the bathroom and the door won't close. Finally I get it to close. I have to defecate very urgently, and some feces leak out of my butt before I get to the toilet, and drop in two pieces on the floor. I pick them up and put them in the toilet and scrub the floor. I hear a yell outside and go out to see what's going on. I hurriedly open the door and see that Virginia is mad that she has been waiting. I'm annoyed because that isn't important to me, and I would like to defecate in peace. I go back to the bathroom. The toilet is about to overflow. I turn off the water and am going to plunge the toilet. I'm on campus at Brimson. I see people. Everyone knows something I don't know. I talk to Linda. She tells me Virginia was so mad at us! It turns out that Linda was having sex with my family's friend Mike Bautsch, when Virginia came in with Mike's son Jeff Bautsch. Virginia was also having sex with Mike on occasion, which means she was cheated on! She was really mad! I walk with Linda, who is then white and has blond hair. Then Linda is Becky. I tell her I would still have sex with her. She replies that she wouldn't have sex with me, but starts to talk as if she knows someone who would. I tell her I won't do that. I walk by a man I work with at Brimson named Josh Trodden, who asks me why I wouldn't have sex with this other person. I keep walking and don't reply. I walk through a gate at a place that is like a bus depot. There is confusion about which is the entrance and which is the exit."

I show the photographs to my sister Ramona. There is a brick or stone wall or cliff in the photographs. A man looks on as I show them to Ramona. There is a rumbling noise that gets louder. We're near the bottom of a cliff. I know the noise is a rockslide. I wonder if I should run towards the very base of the cliff so that the rocks will tumble over my head, or if I should run away from the bottom of the cliff, trying to outrun the rocks as they roll off the edge of the cliff. I run away from the cliff out onto a flat area. I look back up at the top of the cliff and see rocks tumble off it and hit the ground below. People and vehicles with people in them are fleeing and get corned between the oncoming rocks and the cliff. The people fall or get pushed off the cliff. Vehicles are smashed into and pushed off the cliff by other vehicles and rocks. They tumble down the cliff and explode. It is a tragedy. I feel sad. The people that are with me at the bottom of the cliff have run away safely. We walk in a group, saddened by the loss of lives. We are in Australia at an airport that is near the cliff. There is snow on the ground and we trudge through it, consoling each other. A plane with words written on it arrives, maybe to help. There is a train tunnel that has a bomb in it. Bomb detectors arrive, maybe on a plane. A woman and a small yellow box-like organism are two bomb detectors. They go in the tunnel. A bomb explodes and they \"die\", but aren't really dead. The box and the woman have sex and regenerate themselves. The woman seems mechanical. A very attractive naked man and woman come out of the tunnel. They are bomb detectors that have defused the bomb. I have sex with a woman, and it seems I'm in the tunnel. She squirms and wiggles to the point of an ecstatic orgasm. I'm receiving fellatio, first by a woman, and then by a man. There is white stuff that may be semen, on his mouth and face. It's messy. I position my body so that I have the best angle to penetrate his throat. He tilts his head back."

I howl, to see if the wolf will howl back. The wolf howls, and other wolves howl in the distance. I loose my footing and slip on the wood, and then climb back up. There are two Japanese tourists there. There are ducks there, and they may howl. I point emphatically to the tourists to photograph the wolf! The wolf jumps off the dock into the water and grabs a loon in its mouth. There are three or four other loons swimming there. There is a diver/cameraman, who may be the Japanese tourists. He clicks photographs of the wolf and the loon, one after another, without stopping. I wonder if there will be enough photographs to make a film: if the frames were all shot in a close enough time span. But this probably isn't the case. I think he took 24 photographs."

I see two Brimson Geology vans in the parking lot of the Hill Lodge. My stepbrother Nan Lawson is with us. He wants and needs to learn how to shoot a shotgun. I show Nan a shotgun, and point out the safety and the pumping mechanism. In one of the guns there is a compartment filled with several rolls of toilet paper. This chamber, once compressed, seems to be the force that propels the bullet. I help Stephen compress his chamber: we squeeze down the sides until it seems to latch. When the compartment is closed there is a piece of paper on it with the signatures of Faye and Glenn Klump, my high school friend's mother and step-father's, on the paper. We all load and shoot shotguns. Stephen and Nan go first. I shoot a gun with a score that has been removed from the top and attached below the trigger. Stephen sees a police car at the intersection of 3rd Street and Home Avenue and points it out to me. I move quickly to try to fire two shots before the police officer gets there, so we can pack up and be gone and not get into trouble. My ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter is standing on the road facing me. I am on the south side of the road that runs by the river. I try to be cool and slick and fire two shots effortlessly in front of her, but there is a toilet paper tube stuck in the gun, and when I go to pump the gun it jams. I take the tube out quickly and fire two shots over Jackie's head, which is dangerous. I wasn't thinking when I fired those shots. We pack up quickly. The shotguns didn't seem to be very loud or have that much power. The police car drives by and we see that it's not actually a police officer. I know there is a softball game tonight, and my knees are sore. I go into a room. As I go to the door there is a trench dug in the dirt on my left side. In the room there is a black and white drawing on the wall. The drawing looks very Christ-like, and it may be of my dad. My dad and sister Ramona are in the room with me. I know that my brother's friend Mryle Madden's wedding took place next door to this room. There are many boxes of wine and beer on a pallet. My dad asks me about going to liquor stores, and uses the word \"noctus\" or \"nuktos\" or something. I say I go to Big Red's Liquor. Then he asks me about a torpedo. I say that my friend Kevin Simpson uses them for fishing. My dad says no, a torpedo is a drink of bourbon that one swirls around. French fries are cooking in the oven."

She leans back on me and we start to have a sexual encounter. I rub my hand on her crotch. I can tell she isn't used to this aggression. We take our clothes off. She gives me fellatio and we have sex. There is an open door, and we are in a room. I feel like I'm imagining being with her: like it's not real. I have my erection stuck behind my left leg, and I imagine Jackie sitting on top of me and us having sex. It is good sex. She has never had sex before, and is strong, sturdy, and aggressive. She likes the hard physical contact and penetration. The door closes and I notice a person in blue leaving the doorway. This startles me. My state of mind changes: this seems dream-like, and waking-like. I roll or crawl over to the door and holler/moan. It was my housemate Norman Noman at the door. I think: If I was dreaming, I couldn't have been masturbating because of muscular atonia in REM. I ask Norman if I was dreaming of masturbating of if I really was masturbating. He says I really was masturbating: he saw me."

A woman is in the place where we are. There is something wrong with her: she is disturbed or upset. She is upstairs. Nat and I think it would be a good idea to give this woman drugs to calm her down. There is a small dental floss-like container of aspirin that we could use. It is on a shelf with other items. Nat grabs a big bottle of aspirin. I tell him not to open it because I've got a big bottle back in my room that's already opened. But he has already opened it and broke the seal. I go back to my room to get the aspirin. I want to flirt with Hilary, and possibly have a sexual encounter: I'm horny. It looks as if she could be under my blankets, but I pull them away to see that she is not. She is in the next bedroom under the blankets. I want to have sex with her. We flirt. I go back to Nat. The woman is still upstairs. We fill a small pink or purple plastic egg with aspirin to give to the woman. I think to myself that I wouldn't have a sexual encounter with Hilary when she was seeing my housemate Stephen Ramos. The woman starts to come down the stairs. We hear her and hide. I go into the next room. There are two mirrors positioned so that I can see the bottom of the stairs from behind the wall. I think, then, that if I can see her using the mirrors she'll be able to see me. I move, and as I do the woman walks across a different room, adjacent to the one I'm in. She sees me as I try to hide, so I come out and go into the kitchen where she is. She is wearing a bathrobe. She is very beautiful. She has short dark hair. She is fairly short, about 5'6\", and looks a bit like my high school classmate Rachel Hardy, but is much cuter. It seems that I know her somewhat. I pick her up and lay her down on top of the table, opening her robe. She has very nice breasts. We talk very briefly. I understand that she is 22 years old, and has a 12 year-old daughter. It seems that she had a sexual encounter with a man, who I imagine to be a large, tall red neck: a jerk who mistreats women, and has mistreated her. She is very beautiful, with clear, clean, soft, supple skin. I'm very attracted to her. We start to have a sexual encounter. I start to give her cunnilingus. She mocks me subtly, saying I'm not doing a good job: that I don't hit the clitoris. I lick and rub her clitoris area, but don't find the clitoris. She is experienced with sex, and just wants a good, hard, satisfying fuck. She isn't beautiful or graceful like the woman I put on the table, but still, they are the same woman. I rub her g-spot with one, then two fingers. I think of putting three fingers in, but don't. I do this with considerable pressure. She starts to orgasm. She moves my fingers to where her clitoris is, and I can feel it with my tongue: a little ball of rough, raised, firm flesh. I keep licking her clitoris and rubbing her vagina. I awaken and open my eyes for a fraction of a second, and then close them and remain in a dream. [I'm not sure if this happens in the dream or in real life.] I know I'm on a single mattress on the floor of my room dreaming of having sex. I want to ejaculate. I keep licking and rubbing her, and am thrusting my pelvis. She comes close to orgasm, as do I. I don't ejaculate."

I tell everyone that I really take pride in my filth, and that I was going to take a shower, but just didn't. I walk towards my home. I walk by a church-like ceremony where men are pushing boats on trailers: one per person. I go down a grassy step-like hill into a dormitory area. One man walking near me turns left and goes through some glass doors to do his laundry. I go straight to, my room, and see Peter Crater outside my door. I then realize I have forgotten my key. The door is open, I see, so I go in. Peter follows me when I invite him in. My classmate Allie Crater opens the door to her bedroom. She is sitting on her bed inside the room. She has a white blanket covering part of her body and doesn't seem to be doing anything but sitting. Her bedroom is entirely white. It's pretty. I think we may have interrupted her masturbating because she doesn't look like she's doing anything. I go upstairs to my bedroom. Peter and Allie are going to a bookstore. They ask me where it is. I don't know. We decide it's probably over by the campus store."

His father looks much cleaner and more \"normal\" than Chad. I want to be alone. People can't need me. The woman is odd. She wants to be with me, and thinks she can change me to be more social. I find her annoying. My grade school classmate Misty Ryan walks by the woman and I. We walk by railroad tracks on campus. Garages are there. There is glass on the floor.

I ride up and down on this huge cable, in a sine-wave path. There is some rebound, some slack, when I go off the top of the peaks of the cable. This is not good, I know. It results in a ripple-like effect as I descend into the downward portion of the wave. It would be easy to get off the track, and all the loose track-like wooden structures would pile up like in a rear-end car accident. I realize I'm going to be late.

We seem to be on a dock or floatation device. I cast downstream towards the rapids and slowly crank the minnow in. I'm using a bait-casting reel that has two handles and looks like a Zebco 33. Matt is in the water, very close to my bait. He is looking at my bait, like it is in a good spot to catch a fish. He watches it. I can't really cast off to the right because there are other lines out there. My dad is fishing with a gray square bobber. The bobber goes under a bit and moves across the surface: he has a bite! We watch his bobber. I'm in the water on the left side of the dock. I see a big northern pike, heavier than five pounds. It is the one with my dad's lure in its mouth. Very slowly and calmly I tell him to take up the slack line and set the hook. I see the treble hook is on the right side of the pike's mouth. I motion with three fingers, on the side of my mouth, trying to communicate with them that now is the time to set the hook! My dad takes up the slack line. The fish is lifted out of the water: Matt is lifting it up. They didn't set the hook, so I'm worried the fish will shake the hook loose. The fish seems to be paralyzed as they lift it up. They lift it by the line, and the fish hangs there. When it is out of the water, Matt grabs it. I look and see it is a huge walleye, seven or eight pounds! I grab a net and hold it under the fish in case the fish shakes the hook free. I tell dad that this fish would be considered a trophy to some people. My dad wants to let it go.

It's not that I'm attracted to her, per se, but rather that I'm horny, she's there, and she is fairly attractive. She rubs my penis and I put my hand down her pants. Her crotch feels very skinny, like there isn't a lot of flesh in her lower abdomen or thighs. Her vagina is like a big hole, that is about one and a half inches in diameter, with all the flesh in her crotch stretched very tight to her skeleton: she is very skinny. We're going to have sex. I want to go behind the building and have sex in the grass. The building we're next to is her dentist. She has to go to the dentist's office. She suggests we go in and have sex in the bathroom, and then have sex outside later. I say that good because I'll only last two minutes the first time anyways! Mya is naked, and I'm really aroused: I want to have sex! We go inside the office. There are several female receptionists at the desk. Mya isn't there: she may have gone back to her appointment. I introduce myself to the receptionists. They know who I am because they know my mom, Natalie Redding. I'm sitting down when one of the women dials up a radio show and hands the phone to me to make a song request. I take the phone, feeling flustered, and a female radio show host is on the line. I start to say the name of the office I'm calling from, and the women I'm with cue me in on the name of the place. But the host already knows from where I'm calling. She plays a recording of the name of the office that we're at over the phone for me to hear. I ask her to play Saturday Night Fever, and she says maybe I should listen to that by myself! So then I suggest Billie Jean. She says she won't play that either. I tell her that those are the only two songs I would want to hear, and I hang up. I'm sitting around with the women, and they tell me that I'm responsible for looking after these two small blond-haired boys that are running around by us. I don't know what that entails. I know that the boys don't like to be left alone. There are two men there in their late 20's. It seems they are having a barbeque. They are the fathers of the two boys, and are rednecks. They aren't paying much attention to the boys. I try to keep track of the boys while they run around."

I go in and race up to the top via the stairs, while the little man takes the elevator. We're in a room where a drug deal is taking place. I realize now why he wanted me to go slowly: because the drugs are illegal. There are several people there doing the drug deal. The drugs are packaged securely. The drug dealers are minorities: either black or Hispanic. I'm afraid of them. Different drug dealers put colors on me, from different substances. I get red, yellow, and blue on me. I get angry and react, but am scared of retaliating against these people because they are black and because they are drug dealers. I fight with them."

We go by my friend Gino Teavor's house and come to the intersection of Holy Avenue and Main Street. A man in our group is driving a black Suburban. My friend Tom Napper owns the Suburban, and is with the man in it. The man scratches the side of the Suburban while pulling up to the light, and then backing up next to some cement posts. Tom is angry that this happened. I'm worried that the man won't cross Main Street without being hit by a car. There is a lot of cross-traffic. I don't trust him, and I wish I were driving. I'm on a bicycle next to the Suburban. I balance on the bicycle, not moving, but not touching my feet to the ground. My friend Norman Noman and ex-girlfriend Jackie Hunter are there. They talk about the name of a cell. We all cross the street. I'm the only person on a bicycle. My bicycle is an old 10-speed. There are two restaurants to choose from: The Greasepit, or ____, which has a name similar to the Copper Lantern, but is a fast food place by the locksmith on Main Street. I ask people where they want to go. My classmate Fred Potter says the Copper Lantern-like place. We all turn right and go to this place. They serve turkey sandwiches. I go up to order. I see an order being served: it is turkey on two pieces of white bread with mayonnaise and some little trimmings. I ask the man serving it if that's all they have. He says it comes cut in half. I see on the price board that the cost of the sandwich is $4.76. I think to myself that I'm hungry, and would want three or four sandwiches. This is too expensive for me. I get on the bicycle and go to the Greasepit. People yell for me as I go. I go through the trailer park, breaking open a gate as I ride. I ride through a forest. The ground is soft with leaves and needles on it. My housemate Stephen Ramos is behind me in the distance, following me. I hear him singing. I wish he wouldn't follow me. I don't want him to try to persuade me to go back. I just want to just be, and in this case to be without him. The tune he sings is a kind of uplifting, mid 1980's, cheesy, see-the-light song. It goes, \"...and through...\". The pitch is high. I think my friend Matt Yams may be working at the Greasepit."

I think he has sprained his ankle, and I have him elevate it. His father drives around the rink area in a station wagon. He pulls up near us. I tell him what is wrong with his son, telling him it's just a sprain, and it will be okay. I help the boy over to the car. When we get there my high school classmate Nicole Peterson gets out of the car! I am surprised and happy to see her. We talk briefly and I offer her a ride home since the man and boy are leaving. She accepts. I offer her a ride because she's my friend and I haven't seen her in a while, but also because I'm attracted to her. We walk to my truck, which is parked on the curved turn-off lane from where Roundabout Way and the Thru Highway intersect, going towards Yardville. We get in and I start the truck. Nicole climbs in the passenger side window. I notice she is fat. I try to shift into first gear and the transmission doesn't seem to grab. I go very slow, as if I'm in third gear going five miles per hour, and the engine sputters and chokes. I pull out onto the highway in front of a lot of fast moving traffic. I'm going much slower than the traffic. I try to speed up but am still going slow. There is a clicking and knocking sound coming from the engine. I go slow, and then stop on the side of the road. Something is wrong. I look to see what it is. There is a branch dragging from the left rear tire. The right rear tire has some hose or metal pipe-like structure attached to it, extending out from the truck. The tire is torn and ripped to shreds: way past the bald stage, exposing what the tire is made of. I see that the tire is flat. All the tires are flat. The front of the truck slants down, at an angle. Nicole has to be at a wedding at 8:30, and it's 7:52 now! I think of my options. I could run back to my dad's house and have him give us a ride to Nicole's house, or we could just walk on to her house. We're pulled off to the side of the road just south of the bridge. I talk and flirt with Nicole. I tell her I would want a date with her tonight. She says she would want a date with me too. In saying that I expose my long withheld feelings of attraction towards her. I'm going to back the truck up so it's way off the shoulder of the road. I put it in reverse but there isn't enough power to back up. The truck rolls forward and I try to ease off the clutch and let reverse kick in, but it doesn't. There are some white trash beer-drinking men on the side of the road. I feel protective of Nicole, from them. I want to back up, so I try to stop and brake, and then back up. I step as hard as I can on the brake pedal but I keep rolling. So I put the truck in first gear and pull out into the ditch-type median, to get back to where I was. I'm driving on the rims. The traffic is going fast both ways."

I direct her through a door, down a long room, and to her left.  I'm outside. It's cold. A woman with a baby carriage walks on the frozen, icy roads. I'm walking to Default High School. The woman and I are over near the intersection of Brimson Street and Old Avenue, near the frontage road. I walk west down the frontage road towards Default High School. I don't have a hat. I don't have a lunch ticket: I forgot it, and then realize it has run out and I need to pick up a new one. I can't get a new one at Default High School. I don't have a lunch token, and I wonder how I should pay for my lunch. Pizza pockets are being served. I walk around what seems to be the new dormitory at Brimson. There are businesses there. It is cold and bleak outside. I walk east on High Avenue. I don't' really know where I'm supposed to go. I walk by a small restaurant, then go back when I decide I'll avoid the school lunch hassle by eating at the restaurant. I go into the place, which is a Sandwich Heaven. Daphne and Sara Booker, acquaintances, are sitting at a table next to the door when I enter. I walk farther in. My dad and Grandpa Redding are there. I'm surprised because I was just thinking of when I would see them together. Grandpa is smoking. He has an old wrinkled face. I go over to them and shake their hands. There is a crowd of people I know here, which strikes me as odd, but fortunate. My sister Ramona, cousins Rich, Melvin and Melissa Redding, uncle Rusty Redding, and others are there. My dad is playing pool on a small table: like bumper pool without the bumpers. I ask Melvin and Rich how they're doing. Rich's back is better. He has been running with no shirt and his back and shoulders are very tan, but are sun burnt and peeling. I'm on Main Street in Oak Valley between Bill's Deli and the intersection of Main Street and the Thru Highway. I'm on the north side of the road or on the median. Rusty is with me.

Someone is above the door holding it closed because they don't want me to go in: it isn't safe. I enter a room on my left and close the door behind me. The door has a two-pronged latch to fit into an eyelet. I don't lock the door. I quickly go into a room and close and close the door behind me. The door immediately locks: I hear it click. As soon as the latch locks a small black machine with one large and two small tubes begins pumping poisonous gas into the room. I realize I'm going to die. There are metal bars enclosing me in the room, separating me from the gas machine. I shudder when I see a cold naked dying person curled up on the floor. I cover my mouth and nose. I know I'm dreaming."

I swim back up to the hole and remove the hole cover to get a light. But no one gives me a light. I create a light in my hand. I make it through a chicken coop-like area. I can't breath well at first, but this gets easier. I think of how hard it would be to share a mouthpiece underwater. I see the key that is my goal to obtain. Cautiously I move the key towards me: I don't want to just walk in the room where the key hangs. I get the key and run! My friends Nate Nelling, Tom Napper, Emily Zates, and others are there. We run in a chicken coop-like area. The floor is dust, dirt, cobs and chips. The ceiling is very low. There are pool tables in this subterranean-like area. We move quickly. The ceiling becomes lower: we crawl. We get to an \"out\" door for August. I've gone too far: I was supposed to exit at July. I exit here. I follow Nate out, squeezing through a small square space. As I emerge a woman is there. We're in a workplace area. She asks and I tell her about my disability: I have come back just to look, not to work. My mom and my brother Wally are there. We're going to leave. I pack up my dirty laundry. There is a woman with colored stamp pads. I put on my Redson basketball shirt and my red checkered shorts. I turn my shorts around, because they're on backwards. My grade school principal, Candy Bevner, sees this."

I look for her room, but don't know which one it is and can't find it. I knock at a room where the door is partially open and I walk in a bit. There are several women in the room that tell me that Arlete has moved out. The room is larger then: it seems like a quad room in Wonkers hall. It has bunk beds, desks, clothes, and makeup all over. There are five or six women there that are in their first year in college. One woman is in front of me. She pulls up and takes off her red sundress. She is naked underneath it, and has a very attractive body. I quickly say, \"Pardon me!\" and turn away, so as not to look at her. A tall blond women wearing moderately heavy makeup says to me, \"Do you want to fuck her?\" and indicates the naked woman. I say no, and I act surprised. I'm most surprised that the blond woman asked such a forward question. After the initial surprise, I would have had sex with the naked woman. The idea didn't cross my mind until the blond woman suggested it. All of the women in the room are very horny. One of them says my name when talking to me. I ask her how she knows my name, because we've never met. She says, \"I am a woman...(I forget the exact wording, but it involves the word 'cotton', the idea of maxi pads and menstruation, and the idea of getting her sexual and reproductive needs satisfied by being on the lookout for men). This is how she knows who I am: I'm a potential sexual partner. I take this to mean she has an interest in me, because she knows something about me. I ask all the women if one of them could lend me a door key for the dorms. Six or seven women scramble to get me a key! I really enjoy the attention and admiration, but I play it down and try to act \"mature\". I leave, and a shorter woman follows me. She has a big crush on me. I'm near the door and there are stairs behind me. I push the woman away from me, down the stairs, and then I grab her arm at the last minute before she hits the steps and let her down easy. She seems to be hopelessly infatuated with me. I ask her name, and she says, \"Europe\". I say, \"That's a pretty name.\" I walk out on campus. I needed a door key to get back in the dorm. I am walking by a big psychology barbeque. Many bratwursts are being cooked. I wander over to it carrying a box of potato chips. My high school classmates Gino Teavor and Binky Ahmed are at the barbeque. I talk to them about a poker game. My mom is there. I talk to her about where to sit. She tells me there is a table with a small red cooler at hit over in the corner. This is where I should sit because the person with that cooler is with me, in my group. My dead friend Mark Long is there, with a small red cooler as well. He seems very happy and free, and is having a good time. The group of first-year women is there. I don't want to be too forward with them, but I do desire their attention and affection."

Carla says, \"Good\": she is glad I don't care about the holes in the apples. We drive very close to other vehicles. The lanes are narrow and the cars are packed tight, one next to the other. It is stop-and-go traffic. We go through an area where some farmer men are harvesting hay. We drive through a field area where hay has been cut. Farmers with pitchforks move the hay. Hay bales are being made.  I'm with my housemate Stephen Ramos and his father Franco in a large barn that the Ramos' own. We have to move hay bales. Stephen and I use a wooden cart to move the bales. I suggest we start at the near end and take the bales from that side, rather than haul bales from farther down through the narrow space along the near bales. Stephen doesn't agree with my suggestion. We move the bales in his way."

An Asian man with three small children walks by. The children are the moose calves, and the Asian man may be the cow moose. There is a white goat that wanders over near me. It has curled gray horns. It has a five-gallon bucket of feed that it eats. It may have grabbed the bucket itself, or a man may have grabbed the bucket for the goat. The man is from Regions College. Two Australian kick boxers walk by in the alley. One has pads on, and the other is practicing on the padded man. The man from Regions says to me, \"You don't see that (the Australian kick boxers) much.\" I agree, but there have been more in recent years."

I don't tell her why, but my reason is that if I hug her I'll want to kiss her more than I already do. I kiss her. We aggressively kiss and embrace each other. I move my hand down and rub her crotch on the outside of her pants. She moves my hand away. I move my hand back to touch her again. She gets mad and reprimands me, saying I don't listen. I feel guilty: I've done wrong. I wasn't taking Ivory's words and actions literally, directly, or seriously, which is how she meant them.

I'm lying with Annie on the floor, with my arm around her. We haven't seen each other in a long time. There is a sleeping bag that we use to cover up. It becomes unzipped. Bubba falls out of a top bunk onto his head. He is unhurt. I'm showing Bubba and Annie sketches of my dreams. We're downstairs. My drawings and sketchbook are big, colorful nylon flags that I flip through. I can't find some of the sketches I like the most. Bubba isn't very impressed: he doesn't appreciate them. Annie seems to appreciate them more. Bubba jokingly starts to grope my butt. I yell at him, seriously, and I tell him I'm not comfortable with him groping me. Annie is in the bathroom taking a shower. Bubba is in the bathroom with her. I am wary of how Bubba can be overly persistent and assertive at times. I'm in the kitchen. I quickly eat a Bavarian cream-filled Bismarck with chocolate frosting. I go into the bathroom. I startle Annie by opening the door, and she cuts herself shaving her legs. I feel bad, and go to give her a petty consoling. I kiss her, but my mouth is full of the donut, so I pull back. She's sitting in a bathtub with sides that are only a couple inches high. She's naked, and I see she has shaved her pubic hair. I wonder if she did this because of her girlfriend at Prancy. It is a big turn-on for me. I take off my clothes. I gather up the note cards that are on the sink that may be for my Judaism presentation. On the sink are Annie's bra, an unused, unrolled white condom, and the backing to a maxi pad, which Annie didn't use because her period is over. I really want to have a sexual encounter with Annie. I start to get an erection as I am standing near the sink as she gets out of the shower. She puts on a pair of clean white underwear and a long sleeved shirt, which she leaves open and loose. I am very aroused, and I kiss her. She starts to kiss me back, but stops and starts to talk about what other people will think. I'm disheartened because this is totally not in line with my philosophy. She gets out a notebook in which she has written down characteristics of me. She starts reading the characteristics, and says several words that start with the letter 'z', which I have not heard before. She says I am \"overly ____ (I forget)\". I don't know what all the words mean, but I know they have negative connotations. She seems to think I'm too radical, aloof, one-sided, ill sighted, or too dedicated on the wrong track. She doesn't want to have a sexual encounter with me. I walk away to get something, feeling disheartened. I still want to go back later and see if she wants to have a sexual encounter then. I'm crushed by her rejection, but I still have hope. At some point we discuss our friend Tiny Combs and Middleton College. Annie asks me if anyone else from our high school friends applied to Middleton. I say that Stephen did. Later I realize what she was asking, and that I too applied to Middleton, but I don't say anything."

The ledge overlooks the main parking lot next to the movie theatre, with Perkins on my left side. The ledge is about 20-30 feet off the ground. The parking lot is empty and the sun is rising. A teacher is on my left, and my brother Wally and another man are on my right. Two men come out of a first floor door of some apartments and jump down to the ground unscathed! I'm amazed at this, because it is a 25-foot drop, and neither man so much as flinches. They immediately rush into a store with guns to rob it. They may have ski masks on. One of the robbers brings a man out of the store at gunpoint. The robber then goes back into the store. The man from the store has an Oozy machine gun that he holds behind his back. The robber emerges from the sore and goes towards the man. The robber takes the man's gun. The second robber brings two young women out of the store. Each woman is pushing a snowblower. The snowblowers are being stolen. The snowblowers are put into the bed of a small gray truck and the two women and the man are put in the passenger seat: all three are taken captive. One of the robbers gets in the truck and speeds over towards us to pick up the other robber. He skids to a stop very close to us and the second robber gets in the truck. Those I am with and I have guns. I have a huge black M-16 assault rifle. It's a mammoth gun and could really do some damage. The truck has stopped right around the corner of the building ledge we're sitting on. I whirl around and aim my rifle at the driver's seat where the two robbers are sitting, as they drive away. I'm shaky with the gun: I've never worked it before, and it's all I can handle. I don't fire any shots, and the truck pulls away. One of the men I'm with thinks I pointed the gun at his head when I spun around and took aim. I thought the safety of the gun was off, and it was ready to fire, but I see now it was on the whole time. I'm in a truck. I have two arrows stuck in my left forearm. I pull them out. A third arrow has been shot in my arm, and I pull it out too. I bleed a very small bit, and the wound on the surface is small. I'm on a big swing with others. I still have my gun. I lose my shoe: it lies on the ground. I try to pick it up when we swing over it. We are done swinging then. I have books of matches that I keep in my socks."

It is second grade graduation, and all the Carter School classes are there. The second graders rise and sit, rise and sit, shouting out words as they stand. They are all happy to graduate and emotions run high. I see a kid who I know to be Jake Meyer, the younger brother of my grade school classmate Jana Meyer. He has a full, thick, dark goatee. He is 10 or 12 years old. There is a preacher who talks. His front teeth are a bit crooked and pressed backwards."

The people are tired and hungry. They have a few guns and spear-like sticks. The approaching soldiers are shot. I'm sitting with some people, and it is pointed out that my arm turns black when I flex the muscles in it. I have a stick that is a spear with a sharp point. Some people walk close to us and go up on the rocks above us, as if they walk up a rocky ledge of stairs. One of three people is like my friend Bill Hanson, but is also my friend Melanie McDyss' boyfriend. Like Bill, he has long thick biceps. These three people are not our people. They are like soldiers. I stab the man who is like Bill with my spear. It goes deep into his pelvis, his loins. I think I may be in trouble because I haven't killed this man: he may be able to retaliate. I stab all three people. I stab one man in the temple, and another in the chest. There may be a woman in the group. When I stab the people my spear sticks in the white wall and I break it off and stab then with the other end."

A man comes in with a small brown rental refrigerator. The refrigerator is full, and I know it is stocked every Friday. I seem to be by myself. In the refrigerator are cans of Horses Hoof beer and Barqs Root Beer. I drink one and put the empty can on a shelf, which seems to be the second shelf from the bottom of a bookcase under the phone at the Whitman house. I think of drinking a lot more, but I want to see if anyone is around. I see a stairs to the basement, and close the door. I go from the door to the living room, to another room where there are stairs leading up. I go up the stairs and notice there are several people sitting on a couch that I didn't know were there. They were in the next room. When I get upstairs I'm with my friend Niles Zelling, who lives in the house. We're sitting on a bed. There are two couples there. We all talk. I let out a long, loud fart. Niles doesn't flinch when I do this. The men there are jock-types. There is a man there who asks us if we have anything to present. I want to tell him that I have several things to present; that I'm working on factors that effect dream recall in people, and anxiety and personality, and two other projects involving dreams. I see the parking lot of Large Company that is across from Bob's Sports Arena. There is a man with a snowplow. The man says he will only plow snow in the summer. Others and I tell him to work in the winter, and that there will be snow soon. He refuses to work in the winter, and will work only in the summer. I see him in his snowplow when he is in the parking lot. The plow is yellow or orange, and the orange plow holder is in the middle of the parking lot. The man is Chuck Walters, the new paleontology professor at Brimson. I ride with Chuck and one or two other people. We may be in my truck. There is a bag of groceries in the bed of the truck. I feel like there are other bags that I've forgotten. We drive south on Home Avenue in Oak Valley, through the railroad area towards the intersection of Home Avenue and 3rd Street. Someone comments on how everyone gets one of those, meaning, my friend Melanie McDyss, when they arrive in a foreign country. Everyone thinks Melanie is cute. We drive up near my home. I'm on a bicycle, with others. I drive under a plum tree, which may be my plum tree, and try to grab a plum. I go past my house, through my yard, and start to go down the alley. I stop and turn around, and go back to my house to get my mail and talk to my mom and my sisters Ramona and Heather. I park my bicycle near the back door. It is 4:00 or 5:00pm on a warm, sunny summer evening. I smell bacon cooking. I go in, and my mom is happy to see me. They are eating BLT's. I have $1,000 to pick up at home."

I end up near the Super America where I began. There is an apartment building attached or next to the back of Super America, but I have walked six blocks to get there, when I could have taken 50 steps and been where I wanted to go. I go into the apartment building where I live. My friend Sam Crimson is in the elevator, and he holds the door for me as I get in. We go up to the first floor. He gets out and goes to see or do something with our friend Jimmy Youngman. There are many buttons in the elevator. Some of the buttons have the same number on them: there are two rows of buttons for the numbers one through five. I'm going to apartment 18. I hold the door open on the first floor. Four or five young women enter the elevator. Sam enters too. We go up to the third floor where apartment 18 is. I get out, and two of the women follow me. One of them seems to have a crush on me. I try to fend her off by showing her I'm not really interested in her. I tell her I'm probably going out to a bar tonight, and so I can't spend time with her. I start to unlock the door, and two people in the apartment start shouting and moving around: they were having sex. I go and sit by a counter top-like place and talk to the two women while I wait for the two people inside the apartment to get decent. I meet the second woman, who is Asian. The landlord comes out of the apartment. He is old and has white hair. He's wearing a white button-down shirt with a green cardigan sweater over it. My friend Melanie McDyss comes out of the apartment with a shorter Asian man, who is her boyfriend. She is wearing boxer shorts and a t-shirt. She and her boyfriend were having sex. She is aloof, and wanders in and out of the doorway, not really sure of what she's doing. The landlord takes a cat and puts it on the couch, which is in the large, wide hallway that all the apartment doors branch out from. He puts the cat on a bunch of toilet paper that stretches to the door of apartment 18. He wants the cat to urinate on the toilet paper on the couch. He thinks the toilet paper will soak up the urine. He is on the phone at the same time he does this, and he says that this urination is a positive thing, whereas defecation would be negative. The landlord is old and senile. He pushes or shoves one of the men around. The man pushes his back, but he is too senile to notice this. I'm inside the apartment. There is a Christmas tree and an orange road construction sawhorse there. There is a note that says the landlord wants to meet with us at two or two-thirty this afternoon. The other three men that live in the apartment have written on the note messages to the rest of us about what they're doing and how the landlord's meeting will fit into their schedule. I haven't written anything, and didn't know about the meeting: I just got home. I go into my room, which has a large bed. The bathroom door adjacent to my room is closed. The door to the other bathroom out in the main room is also closed. I think Melanie and her boyfriend are taking a shower. There is a clock on the wall with a beer logo on it."

One of the robbers is holding a gun inches from the victim's head, pointing it at his head. The other robber stands about 15 feet in back of the car pointing his gun at the victim, who is the driver. I'm walking with several guys, including my classmate Doug Thompson. I'm not sure how to react when I see the robbery. I move cautiously. The man being robbed tells us to keep walking, past the car. I do. The man drives away. The robbers fire their guns when the man is at a distance, and don't hit him. The others that were with me are still back near the robbers, while I slowly and anxiously keep walking. The robbers rob the other men I was with. I start to run and get away. I'm running down 1st Street in Oak Valley, going from where it intersects Bauer Avenue to where the white house is on the corner of it intersection with Holy Avenue. I see a black woman outside the house and I yell to her from a distance to call 911. When I get to the house I enter through the front door. I go through the dimly lit living room where there is a huge television with many dull colors showing on it. I enter the kitchen where the lights are brighter, and see the woman talking on the phone to the 911 operator. I tell the woman what I know about the two robbers: one is white, about 5'11\", with shaggy brown hair that sticks out from under his winter-type cap, and he had a gun, which was like a six-shooter, that seemed silver, gray, or blue. The other four men I was with, including Doug, have escaped the robbers, and they arrive at the house. The others are younger than Doug. I ask one of them, who is a young black boy, about the second robber. The boy says the second robber was white. I talk on a cellular phone. The 911 operator asks me to hang up, because she can't talk to the woman and I at the same time: there is an electrical or communication problem. I hang up. There is a loud wail in the basement. I go downstairs to see what it is. My sister Heather is there. She has been sexually touched or hurt. Her uterus is sterile, and it is destroyed. She is kneeling on the floor sobbing. There is blood on the floor, walks, and pipes to the sink: essentially everywhere. She kneels and wails while she scoops up bits of bloody intestine-like tissue. These are bits of her uterus. She scrapes them into a pile on the blood-covered floor."

The deck area of the house isn't there: it's a dirt area. I'm with a woman I know. There are several dinosaur eggs that have hatched, and we find two eggs that haven't hatched, but are warm. We each pick up an egg. My egg hatches, and a balloon dinosaur emerges. The other egg hatches, but neither last long. I'm near the overpass of Main Street over the railroad tracks. There is a fight on a ledge between animals and others. Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker and others are tempted, and are fighting to keep from going to the other side. They realize what they're fighting for while the fighting is occurring. This is an episode of the television sitcom Seinfeld. I'm in a ditch that seems to be down by the tracks. There is a lot of food and drink in the ditch, including appetizers and champagne. The champagne bottles are used to kill something, which may be swan-like birds. The corks of the bottles shoot towards the animals to kill them. Others and I try to run down birds. We chase them over by Main Street. A car hits one bird and I grab it. We start to walk back, and are near the white house on the south side of the railroad tracks on the west side of Delivery Avenue. I sense a Tyrannosaurus Rex ahead of us in the distance behind a tree. We all start to run, going north. We get near Carter School. I'm looking for a place to hide that is strong enough to protect me from the dinosaur. I think of hiding underneath the recess stairs, but the others don't think this is a good idea, so we all walk down the alley, going north. There is a small house on the north side of the school with a fence around it. I climb on the fence, to look for shelter. We end up going into an area that is all tiles, like a huge bathroom. The Tyrannosaurus Rex comes; it is following us. We hide and evade it. One man suggests that gingerbread man Olympics be held. The dinosaur follows us closely, and is a man. It is hungry. The man is huge. Someone hits him on the head with a plate. Something happens with food: the dinosaur may sense food. We are all hiding. I run and hide, trying to escape."

I know this is going to be gruesome: his head is going to be blown to pieces. I don't want to see it. I turn my head to the right and squint my eyes. I imagine the cannon firing and blowing off the fingers on my left hand. I see my hand after the shot will be fired. I see a paper printout with lines on it. The lines get shorter on the printout to reflect the missing parts of my fingers."

He is an outdoors type of person. He takes a paddle and a lump of cotton, and starts pulling and stretching the cotton until there is a washcloth on the paddle. Two regular nails and one two-pronged nail for electrical wiring attach the washcloth to the paddle. This is what the old man has to teach us. We are going to work so we learn how to do this. He wants us to haul 20-30 garbage cans full of water up a sandy hill. The man has a young man as an apprentice. The apprentice shows us how to lift a plastic canoe using a paddle for leverage, like a yoke. He wants or instructs us to use the paddles as levers to haul barrels up the hill. He wants us to fill the barrels with dirt and sand. I grab a 20-gallon garbage can and start walking down a sandy hill. I use a hose to spray some of the sand off my garbage can. As I walk down the hill I want to tell the two guys who are at the top of the hill to fuck off, and to leave their can there. It is going to be so heavy and painful to carry these huge cans of water and sand using a paddle on our neck as a lever! Ouch! Then I realize the old man is a fake. His trick with the cotton and the washcloth was a hoax: there was a washcloth nailed to the paddle in the first place, and all he had to do was rub away some loose cotton that was covering the washcloth up. I explain this to my sister Ramona and her friend Barb Mohs while we're standing on metal bed frames, stood on end, at the bottom of the hill. I won't haul the garbage cans. The man was going to use us to haul his water up the hill."

He runs through a yard, over a tall wooden fence, through the back yard, over bushes, and through more yards. Television news crews are covering the story. There is as much speculation that he is innocent as guilty. There are interviews with the running man's friends. One of his friends, a tall man with medium length dark brown hair, questions the man's innocence. The interviewer is a scrubbed clean upper middle class frat-boy-esque man. There is a remake of the scene. The fugitive may have hurt his back flipping over the fence. He may have a broken leg; police don't know. The fugitive could have gone between sparse hedges rather than jumping over them. I see the path he ran. I may be him. He outruns the others. Police may have calculated the man's running speed, in centimeters per second, from the remake of the scene. From this they can project how far he could be. The man is a fugitive! He runs through yards and streets. People chase him, and fall behind as he outruns them. He runs on a street. I see through his eyes. I may be he. There is a wooded area to my left. People come out of the area and point in the opposite direction, indicating the police have infiltrated the wooded area already looking for him, and that he would find no safety in the woods. Some people shake scolding fingers at the man. He (I) questions whether to keep running. It seems futile: the police are everywhere. I wonder if I should hide in a tree in the woods. The police dogs will small me and go nuts, but it may work."

She has just entered. I go over to her to say hi. I'm happy to see her. She leaves very quickly, out the glass doors, and doesn't speak to or acknowledge me. My housemate Stephen is there. He starts laughing at me, talking about her ignoring me, and repeating this. I'm not facing him, but I turn around after he makes four or five of the same comments. I punch him on his left cheek with my right hand. He is surprised, and in shock, and keeps saying something like, \"Oh my god, I can't believe you just did that.\" He is arrogant and righteous in his talk. I am sick of his righteous holier-than-thou attitude. (He may punch me back; I'm not sure.)I leave. I go into a bathroom. I feel guilty for punching him. I wash my face and blot it dry with a towel. I have a puffy lower lip, like I have been struck. I'm the manager of the pizza-like place in this mall. Stephen and my friend Kristy Puffy may also be managers. I open a door from the bathroom that goes into a natatorium with a huge swimming pool. I don't' want to go in there, so I go into another door. I'm in a hallway. There are other hallways and offices around. I follow the hallway and go past an office where a man is doing business on the phone. I'm then in the back stock room of Ace Hardware. I descend a blue metal staircase to get to the main floor. Other employees are around. No one is paying attention to me. I may be an employee. I look for, and find, a pen and piece of paper. I do this to steal goods, possibly a futon. People come back with their merchandise written on paper, and pick it up here. I can steal in this way. I start to walk away and faintly hear my name, \"Kenneth\". Someone is calling me. I walk on without turning around to see how it was, or if they were talking to me. I hear my name again, louder, \"Kenneth\", and I turn around. It is the manager talking. He has blond hair and a blue Ace Hardware vest on. He asks me what the paper and pen are for. He seems to know I was planning on stealing. I lie, saying I just needed a piece of paper. I don't have a good excuse and am anxious. A male employee comes over and interrupts us, asking the manager about a bolt, which he needs. I say I have a bolt, and pull one out of my right jeans pocket. It is about 1 and _ inch long, black, and is kind of like a screw. This will work for the employee. He takes it and leaves. I'm lucky the topic was changed. The manager doesn't suspect me of stealing any more. It is as if the interaction with the employee made me reliable, as if the employee vouched for my honesty. I walk away into the main part of the store and go past the cash registers near the exit. The store is like Country Store in Oak Valley. I turn left and walk behind the registers, past them all. People are lined up: it is busy. Kristy is a manager, and is helping the cashiers, one by one, and is on the second to last cashier, so I'll get to talk to her in a bit about the incident punching Stephen. I go outside into the parking lot. There is a semi truck or bus that carries eggs, which drives away. There is a trapezoidal-like-structure, which I think I can move. This is like the army. It is winter, with ice and snow. I go in the store. Kristy is almost done. I know I'm wrong for punching Stephen. Stephen and our friend Sam Kingsley walk in, after spending time together. Stephen starts talking to me sarcastically, mocking me nonchalantly, making fun of me, and looking down upon me. He says, \"Sorry my arm hit your head.\" He's really making fun of me, saying, \"Sorry my head hit your fist.\" I don't want to apologize. I did express my anger improperly. I want to explain why he was wrong, more than I want to admit I was wrong, because he doesn't understand that he was wrong."

I'm surprised at this, but I think they'll survive because others, including myself, have and do survive. The car is crowded, still. Tarzan tells a man, who may be the bad leader, that he should go into the car and Tarzan will meet him at the edge of the jungle at night. He says there will be enough light for them to make it. Tarzan then goes to the top of a tall tree, at the very top of which there is a bald trunk, broken off, with no branches. He stands on the top of the trunk, with his arms spread wide, and lets out his characteristic Tarzan yell. He then swings down, leaping and catching branches in a strong, sure-gripped manner. On his way down some men are in the tree. The men try to club and beat Tarzan. Tarzan evades the blows and beats the men, injuring them. Tarzan, the strong man, and the leader/manager are in a prison. Tarzan's hands are cuffed behind his back, and his is chained up facing the strong man. Tarzan and the strong man fight. The man head butts Tarzan, and Tarzan's face becomes red from blood. Tarzan rams the other man into a wall repeatedly. The man is facing a wall. Tarzan smashes his head into the wall repeatedly until the man is senseless. The fighting happens in a hallway outside a door with an automatic timed lock. The leader/manager and the strong man are put in the room behind the door, which is the prison. The door closes and makes the initial latch. Tarzan is still connected to the bad man by chains. When the door closes, the chains break. The manager tries to open the door when it starts to close fully. Two of his fingers get caught and are severed in the closing door. This door seems indestructible, and unstoppable. The bad strong man and the manager are in prison, and Tarzan is not."

I choose one of the lines and stand in the metal corral-like line. I'm then the first person in line. A woman calls out for anyone who is flying to Reinhorse, which I know is in Germany, to come to the front of the line. Several men walk by me and descend a staircase to talk to the woman. I hear the woman ask if any of them are willing to change flights, because the flight they're on is really full. The woman says they don't have to change, because they do all have a seat on the flight, but if they did change they would receive compensation. While they talk, we all start to move, and I realize we're going onto a plane flying to Los Angeles. We take off and immediately make a hard right turn. The plane keeps rolling, and we fly in a spiral, spinning like a top as we fly forward. One of the engines is out, and that is causing the spiral. The stewardess says the passengers need to pound on the inside of the walls to get the engine to start, as if it is just stuck. The emergency exit on the plane is open. The engine doesn't start. We spin and fly. People are yelling. I sit next to several men, including my housemate Stephen Ramos. I yell and laugh. We are in a pretty good mood considering we're probably going to die. I joke about how our plane crashing could make a great Fox television special, like \"World's Worse Plane Crashes\". We don't gain altitude, and must land. There is a train below us entering a train yard. If we could land on top of the fast train, we wouldn't crash, and the train could just slow down. We seem to be going in for a landing at the train yard. Then our plane is on the snow-covered ground on a street, sliding, not very fast. I think that since we're in the nose of the plane if the plane slides into the house at the end of the road we could get hurt. The plane stops on the road. I get out of the plane and talk to Stephen. I tell him this whole episode has been so amazing that I must be dreaming. I say this very nonchalantly. I turn and look back and the plane isn't there: I am dreaming!

They get the back of my jeans all muddy somehow. I'm really mad at them, and I tell them angrily that because of the two of them I've ruined four pairs of pants in the past year. I go up to a house and wipe off my boots, which are very muddy. I'm at the front door, but I go to another secondary door. I blow the dirt off the key and open the door slightly. There are two cats inside that try to get out so I'm careful when entering. I enter, and know Nat is in the shower. There's one message on the answering machine that I play. The message is from Party Control in Wilmerton. A man says that they have heard about a party and he says the steps that Party Control is going to take to counteract the party. Nat's tennis evaluation form is on the table. He has given himself good marks with respect to the match he just played. There is a gate that extends the table to the countertop, with a release button on top. The cats climb this gate."

She slips on an icy spot, and makes a pretty good recovery before falling down. I chuckle jokingly at this. We talk and walk towards Courtyard Hall. She is much more agreeable than I would have guessed by looking at her. We part paths. I walk towards the student union. There are several bicycles in the bicycle rack, including my housemate Stephen's old red bicycle. There is a man on a skateboard that skates up and jumps onto the front fork of Stephen's bicycle.

A group of women, including my acquaintances Pat, Gail, and Nora, exit as I enter. They say hi to me. Right as I walk in the door people are conducting a survey for which one is pressured to participate in. My friend Jill Banks is there, and says there is a party at our classmate Sean's house. The survey is about homosexuality, society, and service. I'm not interested in it, and walk on. I go to get my mail. I'm mellow, almost bored, and I feel a bit down: depressed. There are no locks on the mailboxes, which open like bulk food bins. I lift up the lid to my box and get my mail. I have three slips for packages. One of the slips says it is a \"Ball and Chain\" package. I have two skateboards with me, which are hard to carry with my other stuff. I look at my mail solemnly. My friend Melanie McDyss comes up to me and gives me a big hug. She seems to notice that I'm feeling down. Her hug is unexpected, but very nice, and I appreciate it. My classmate Rachel Tandor is there. I hear her talk about her homework problems. I start to give Rachel my sleep and dreams lecture, saying how they are more important than other work. Several of Rachel's friends listen, sitting at a table. I say people need to focus not on work, but more on sleep and dreams. Then I joke, \"Look at me: I focus on dreams, and look how smart I am!\" We all laugh. Rachel had interrupted my hug with Melanie, and I want to talk with Melanie. I hope I can get my three packages: it's almost 4:30pm, and the post office will close soon."

The band-aid doesn't stick to my finger. I have a small black bear in my hands as I sit on the bench. It's about three inches high. It has a white stripe down its back and large fangs like a saber tooth tiger. People playfully put their finger in its mouth, poking its large teeth. I'm wary of this, even though it seems to be such a cute little playful animal. The bear is getting sleepy in my hand: it is drugged."

My old teammate Simon Naver is sitting at a table. Others I know are at a nearby table. I sit by myself at a table because I don't want to associate with many of the others. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas comes and sits with me. Our old teacher Phillip Hacker is teaching Pre-Calculus. We're in the commons-like area, with many tables. I forget my book, so I write a note to myself to get it. I also write a note to my friend Melvin Dahlheimer so that he remembers to get any books he'll need for a class. I'm in the driver's seat of a car with Annie and another woman. I give Annie a letter in an envelope that I've just written, but haven't yet put a stamp on. I give her the letter rather than mailing it to her, because she's there. We're on a class field trip. The car in front of me takes off. I hurry to catch up and almost get lost. We come to a freeway. People in the class are on bicycles. I get on a bicycle and start pedaling. I ride on the freeway, not sure of where those ahead of me have gone. I ride fast, leaving many people behind. I go through a tunnel and am in a house-like structure. I open several doors that have brick walls behind them, so one can't step through the door. It is as if the doors were mounted on the brick wall for decoration. I go downstairs carrying my 10-speed bicycle. I see my friend Melanie McDyss, who is on foot. We hug and laugh and joke. I go out of the house into a garden-like area. Some people, who may be students, are there, with a teacher, who may be Phillip. There is a moss-covered coffin there. I scrape away the moss from the top of it. I uncover a key hold on the middle of the side of the coffin. I'm happy because I think there is only one keyhole. It seems to me that this is a treasure hunt, and because I have uncovered the only keyhole, I'm the winner. The teacher seems to have the key. A second keyhole is uncovered at the head of the coffin. The top of the coffin slides off when it is pushed: no key is needed to remove it. I wonder if this could be a hoax, or if the coffin was robbed, because nothing in the coffin strikes me as important or valuable."

I sit at the back of the plane. There are star NBA players on the plane. We're on the ground. There is a question about whether a gas or oil leak would be preferred. I say I'd rather have an oil leak. The oil filter at the rear of the plane needs to be changed before we take off. The filter is a white cylinder about five feet long and three inches in diameter. We seem to be in Sydney. The advisor will meet us at a place. We drive through a roundabout to get there. An ambulance drives past us with its lights and sirens on.  I'm riding a bicycle with my friends Bubba Hacker and Stephen Ramos. We're going to a National Guard place that seems to be on the east side of Wilmerton. I ride behind Bubba. He has gas, and it smells. My handlebars are crooked and thin, and seem like they could fall apart. We arrive at the place to play football. A group of men are already playing tackle football, wearing pads and blue jerseys. I'm barefoot, and am wary about playing football with them. My high school classmate Wyatt Belzer, and other physically large men, are there. I don't have any shoes to protect me feet. We walk over to the group. There are many hornets buzzing around me. I don't want to get stung."

He has a tent in his car. We go east and turn right onto the second road. A sign says it is five miles to the place where we want to go, which seems to be a place where fossils can be found, and also a small bakery. The sign is for the first right, and I wonder if I'm going the wrong way; if I've gone past the road. I drive fast down a gravel, windy, hilly road. Kevin is in the car behind me following. It's difficult to keep my car on the road because I go so fast. We arrive at a beach area. There are people painting on a wall. There is a preacher-like person there. This seems to be a religious-musical cult. The atmosphere seems to captivate or suck Kevin into it. People try to make us stay: to detain us. We throw fruit and fight, as they do. My former supervisor Ron Fontana is a leader-type man. People throw large tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and berries. I hit Ron with one, and it knocks him back. He throws a green pepper-like fruit at me. I catch it. There is a large sand hill in this place, about 20 feet high, and a water hole that is like a miniature quarry, next to it. There is a key and a board near the water. It may be just above the water, hanging or hovering. I'm frantically trying to escape. I scurry up the sand hill and dive to get the key. I almost lose the key in the water because I have a poor grip on it. There is a very shaky wooden bridge running from the top of the sand hill to a place. This seems like an escape route. Kevin is there, in a blimp. The blimp is about three feet long, and dark in color. There are two teapots connected to the blimp. This is an escape. I grab onto the teapots and hang from the blimp as it rises. Another younger man wants to go too. I tell him to grab onto my foot. We rise, and I notice it seems like we are floating in my kitchen at home in Oak Valley. I think it will be tough to leave, if possible."

The plane starts to move. I turn my chair to face the front of the plane, and grab on to what seems to be a handrail at the side of the plane. There are no chairs on my left but the other rows in front of and behind me seem to be normal airplane seats. As the plane begins to move, a person or people in back of the plane begin to say the prayer of travelers that I know from my childhood, substituting the plane for the car in the prayer. Others and I repeat the prayer out loud after a leader recites each line. The plane starts to go fast, and then slows. I wonder if something is wrong; something seems to be wrong. The plane turns around and seems to go up a stairs or a ramp. Three men with joysticks are controlling the plane. I see them as the prayer is being recited: \"...alertness, good judgment, and quick decision...\" I think that these men must be pretty good at controlling the plane. I hope everything goes smoothly. I'm in an airport with a group of people, in Australia. My friend Matt Yams is there. I carry six sheet-like boards of yellow Styrofoam. I float up to the ceiling while holding them, bump my head, and then float back down. It is really fun to float around! I think some people in the group may be annoyed with my antics, so I stop and walk with the group. I talk with Matt. He says he saw a brown trout in a stream that is on our left. There is a young Australian man leading our group through the airport."

I say that usually ____ (my dad?) takes the flat, south stretch of the alley. We get near their house. We're driving really close to the house, not in the alley. I don't think Gary will be able to pull his car into the space in his driveway between two other cars that are parked there, but he does. I comment on their car: it must ride nice on the highway going 80 miles per hour. Gary talks about how he is glad he got the car because of his involvement in the gulf war. I get out of the car and notice the Wilma has lost a good amount of weight. We walk towards the alley and she tells me that it is the red house that has the dog to let out now, and it is a black lab puppy that weights 80 pounds."

On her right is an empty seat. To the right of the empty seat is a man they are with. The man has his left leg on the open seat, and when I approach whim about sitting in the seat I feel a bit odd because of all the open seats around us, and I'm asking to sit between he and Elise. He responds by moving into the open seat. I shrug this off and sit in this seat he was sitting in. We're watching a basketball game. The players file out onto the court. One of them looks very familiar. He is tall and pudgy with short blond hair. I ask if this is Division II basketball. They reply that it's County or Country League. The game ends. We were waiting for the game to end so we could cross the court and go into a door and up some stairs into the art studio. We get up to cross the court. My friend's father, Franco Ramos, is there. He has big sideburns and glasses, and seems to be a young man, about 30 years old. My friend Stephen Ramos is there too. Elise is dressed in tight black skimpy clothing. There is another woman with long curly golden blond hair, almost yellow. She is shorter than Elise. She is also wearing tight clothes, and has large breasts. I tell Elise I've been hanging out with her friend, and my ex-girlfriend, Annie Thomas this past weekend. We get up to the art department. I see a painting/drawing from my sister Ramona to me. I take it, as well as other construction-like paper, which is between five and seven feet long. I go to walk up more stairs to a place I can paint. I hold the paper over my head, bending the paper in a semicircle against my head. There are many tables on the left side of the stairs as I walk up. It is like a cafe/restaurant. All the tables are full. I recognize my friend Holly Lapson at one of the tables. Franco is also carrying paper up the stairs. He is carrying more, and longer, paper. I get to the top floor, which is light brown, varnished wood, very clean and beautiful. I'm happy and excited to be there. I look around and goof off. I walk by a woman, and she catches me eye. I catch her eye too. She is very cute! Stephen calls me over, saying his easel is a ways down. He warns me sternly, as if he knows better, saying, \"Don't be too confident.\" He is talking about art, and my skills, and how the art community will view my artwork. He's warning me that others may not like my art. He implies that people don't like overconfidence. I tell him that I'm not here to produce a masterpiece; that I'm just here to have a good time. I grab a cracker from a plate of crackers that is sitting out, and go to follow Stephen. The cute woman is near me, and we look at each other again. I smile, and she flirtingly says, \"What?\" I wave hello to her as I follow Stephen. We get down near his easel. The woman has followed us to talk to me. I'm near the easel. She walks up to introduce herself. I quickly point to my mouth, indicating that I'm chewing a cracker and can't talk, and indicate for her to give me a minute until I'm done chewing. Stephen has a two-legged table, which is the easel. It is a flat table that stands on two diagonally slanted wooden legs. He sets up the table. My mouth is dry as I chew the cracker. I'm nervous about meeting this beautiful woman who is obviously interested in me. It takes me what seems like forever, several minutes, to chew the cracker. She has clear, clean skin and shorter brown hair. She is strong, but doesn't look overbearing. She is firm and very feminine. She introduces herself as Angelica."

He is driving in northeast Australia, but I know this to be northwest Australia, going cross-country. He comes up to an intersection, and then seems to be driving a white camper, which may have a trailer. I'm behind the vehicle in a vehicle of my own, or I am a vehicle, which seems to be gray. The white camper goes off the road, though a \"T\" intersection, and up a hill into trees. The actor dies. I don't think that I'll make the right turn at the \"T\", but I do. I'm on a bicycle. I ride on cinder blocks over a stream. My bicycle falls into the muddy stream. I like the water. I feel spontaneous by enjoying the cool water. My friends Niles and Tim Zelling are there, in the water too. My camera is there, and it gets wet in the water."

There are many tiny nicks on my face, as if the blade weren't sharp or I didn't use enough shaving cream. Little pieces of skin stick out making the cut seem more like a bloody rash.  I'm outside the field house at Brimson sitting in an elevated place, like a balcony or on a small hill. I prepare to shave, using a lot of shaving cream. I don't have a mirror. I start to shave by making one stroke on my lower neck.  I'm at home in Oak Valley. I see myself shaving in the bathroom mirror. The first stroke I made without a mirror isn't bad. My mom calls me and says that a woman has just called for me. The woman's name is something like \"Jake\". Her message is that I don't need to bring Carlos Casteneda's book The Teachings of Don Juan to school tomorrow: she has finished reading it. I can't figure out whom this woman is that was calling. I think it may be my high school classmate Carmen Allure.  I'm outside near the Brimson field house overlooking Granger Field. There is a boy and two men playing football there. The ground is partially covered with patches of melting snow, and is really wet. The boy throws the football. One of the men is running for the pass. He dives and gets soaking wet, as if it was his duty to expend the effort to dive since the boy was throwing it. I shave thick hair off my neck and start to shave my upper chest. The hair is thick but stringy, like hair on my head."

            "content": "The Dark Side  I'm watching a movie in a theatre with two men. This may be the movie: There is a man. He is awful and terrible and destructive. He makes people witness all hell, all their pain in life, all the torture and suffering, and makes them endure it. I'm in what seems to be my back yard with this evil being and one or two other people. Each person seems to have a turn. One by one, if a person doesn't obey, the evil being will focus pain and suffering on them. It's a beating that comes in waves or pulses, as if numbers are counted out loud in a rhythmic fashion as the pain is administered, \"One!...Two!...Three!...\" It is very painful and fiery. There are cages that seem to be made of fire that break and disintegrate around the person. It is useless to resist. Resisting will only incur more pain and more of the wrath from this being. I get the wrath of the being because of a comment I made about a case or a 30-pack of beer, which was in a brown case. My body is lifted up into the air six to ten feet where I am hit with waves and bolts of pain and torture. There is no choice but to endure this. The man or being is so strong that any resistance or attempt to escape will only lead to greater pain and punishment. There is an intermission in the movie. I go to the bathroom. The bathroom is old and dirty. The floor is stained with dirty water. I defecate, and have dark and runny diarrhea. The toilet is so long that I stretch my legs out and my boot is in the front part of the toilet bowl. A man peeks into the stall as I am finishing and standing up. I see it is my high school classmate Gino Teavor. I say hi to him and we go to the sinks. There are two old metal hand soap containers that are empty and rusted, with their fronts hanging down. I manage to get some soap out of one and start to lather and wash my hands. Gino kneels down next to the sink he is at to drink. I know he is drunk. My old teammate Ron Lind enters and I say hi. Later, our old classmate Eric Spears enters, looking very out of it: drunk or stoned. A young Asian boy enters the bathroom and vomits what appears to be a McDonalds hamburger into a garbage can. I think he may be really drunk, and trying to keep some food down, which doesn't work. He has a bunch of his belongings spread out on the floor. He vomits again, on the floor. What comes up are what seem to be plastic milk jug caps. I step over and between his belongings on the floor and pull a brown bottle off the shelf. I think this is beer, but I then see that it is a kind of iced tea-like beverage from the boy's home country. I walk out of the bathroom into a hallway, which is the north end of the second floor hallway at Carter School. There is a dartboard on the east wall. I take the darts out of the board, and poke one without tail fins into the bulls eye. I'm alone. I stand across the hallway and throw five darts, one by one. I don't throw them too well. My first dart hits the wall. My second dart hits the dartboard, but on the very edge so it gets no points. My third dart hits a bit farther in. I fall on the floor, like I have tripped, and throw a dart while I'm falling, and one while I'm on the floor. I have two disposable orange and white plastic razors that I want to keep for later. There is a small shelf in the hallway with some items on it, including some orange and white razors that belong to others. I want to keep my razors separate from these. I go back to the movie and sit with the two men. I have a tub of buttered popcorn. The movie seems to go: I'm in my back yard and it is dark. My friend Tom Napper is lying on the ground with a compound fracture in his left leg. I think this is just the monster, but then I'm convinced it is real because the whole area is calm and quiet. When the monster (the evil being) was there, the scene was explosive, electrifying, and magnificent. The other person from the movie is there. I run in and grab some rags and two knives to make a splint for Tom. I come back out and realize I've forgotten to call 911. I go and pick up the phone, and find that it is dead: no dial tone. I run outside. It is barely getting light out, and is about 5:00am. A few of the neighbor's lights are flicking on in preparation for work. I yell out loud, and run over to my neighbor Steve Broud's house to use the phone. He has a dark brown moustache when I see him in the kitchen window. He comes to let me in. He is just getting up for work. I tell him it is an emergency, and that I need to use his phone to call 911. He says okay, but he has to record two messages on his phone first. He hits a few buttons on the phone as I wait. He is wearing very colorful short shorts, and his penis partially hangs out of the top of them. His son Ricky Broud is there, wearing a towel. While I'm waiting I watch television. A man comes on the television that looks and seems like an Egyptian King. He talks and gives speeches on a morning show. His face fills the screen as he talks strongly. He is regal and powerful. He makes a comment about people not thinking about the return of another for 600 years, and how naive this thinking is. I then realize that the evil being, the terror, is still strong, and is behind all this. This last episode has been a hoax."

It is similar to the Talent Show at Armstrong High School: there are several skits. There is a skit with Al Bundy eating a big blue fish, that is about five or six feet long. I may be in one skit, but maybe not. I thought I had a role in it with my friend Stephanie Peterson. As the rehearsal goes on I think I may not be doing the skit: there may be another person doing it. I sit on the very edge of the stage with others. At some point I move off the stage, but some to hang on to the carpeted edge of the stage, so I can see and so I'm not blocking anyone's view. The director is a short, fat old woman teacher. She is a bit like my fifth grade teacher Beth Clafton. I'm then sitting by myself on the front of the stage, as the rehearsal is taking place. The director woman asks me condescendingly what I'm doing (on the stage). I tell her I'm sitting there kind of laying on my side so others can see: if I sat in a seat the person behind me wouldn't be able to see. She frowns on me with disdain. I move down to the seats and sit in the front row with my bush hat on. I am angry with the director. The skit that I thought I would be in seems to be a religious sort of enacting Joseph and Mary. There is a skit where one character loses an eyelash at the Prom. The director lashes out at the students, questioning and criticizing their actions; the reason they pluck their eyebrows. People don't respond very much to her criticism. I speak up and talk back to her. I mock her nonchalantly, smarting off to her. Then I stand up, and am enraged! I yell furiously at her, \"Get the fuck out of here!\" I yell that she has an appointment in my office at 4:00, meaning that she is going to have to deal with me. I yell, enraged, that, \"I'm going to beat your ass!\" I'm furious with her, and I say this in front of all the students. I force the woman, half dragging and half pushing her, out the back sacristy door of Carter Church, where it now seems that we are. I force her to start walking west on 1st Street. I see a truck parked on the northwest corner of the intersection. I think in the truck are my classmate Kevin and another short black man from Brimson. I get close to the truck, pushing the woman along, and I see it's my grade school classmate Jerry Kasper driving. I tell him to help me get away. I think people from inside the building will follow, and I'm in a hurry to get away. I want to throw the woman in the bed of the truck and hop in, but Jerry drives away before I can. He stops near the house on the next corner, in the driveway. He is then driving a small black car. He opens the trunk of the car and I toss the woman in. I don't hear much struggle from her: she doesn't put up much of a fight. I get in the back of the car and tell Jerry to drive out near Superhighway 100 to get away. Our classmate Eric Stoner is in the passenger seat. The roads are snowy and icy, and the car slides. I tell Jerry not to get rear-ended because there's a person in the trunk. We drive past Home Avenue going west. I tell Jerry to take a left on Hill Avenue so we don't have to go down the hill at the bottom of 1st Street, because it's slippery. I look back and see that there are no cars behind us from the church, so no one is following. I am relieved."

            "content": "Tracy Chapman's Budweiser  I'm at a concert with my housemate Stephen Ramos and my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. There seems to be three bands playing. We sit on a small stage-like structure. There are black lights flashing, which bring out the color, especially red, around us. I move out of my seat. I seem to have a heavy load attached to my upper body, like a pack strapped on. It weighs a good amount, and I have to pay attention to my balance. I go back to sit down. My coworker Katie James is sitting a little ways away, off the stage-like structure. As the song ends, Stephen recognizes it as a remake of a Led Zeppelin song. It is a remake called Led ____ (I forget), in which the second word is shorter than Zeppelin. The song we hear is a remake of Stairway To Heaven. The band ends, and I go to the bathroom with others, including Annie. I feel exhausted, though I know I slept 13 hours last night. I tell Annie that I feel like crap: exhausted. She asks just how tired I am. I say I need at least a nap of four hours. I'm in the bathroom. I splash water on my face to refresh me. Annie enters the bathroom and tells me her mother is going to cook dinner, and implies I am invited. I'm a bit happy because I won't have to go to this dinner, using the excuse that the long nap I'm going to take will overlap the dinner hour. Back at the show, Tracy Chapman is playing next. I sit at the kitchen table at my home in Oak Valley with Stephen and our friend Kevin Simpson. They have or are getting submarine sandwiches, which look like Subway Spicy Italian sandwiches on white bread. I cut out holes in the layers of pepperoni and place pickles there. Stephen does not want tomatoes, but he does want lettuce, which I don't put on at first. My classmate Hanna Landers approaches me as I sit and says, \"I might consider paying.\" She seems to be in charge of admission costs and implies that I should pay her here and now. I am guilty of not paying. I get out my wallet. I ask her how much. It is normally $5, and she tells me $8. I ask her plainly and accusingly if she raised the price. She replies flatly that she did. My friend Melanie McDyss is there, and seems to have some sympathy for me. She may toss me a few caps, a portion of a red roll of caps that are used for a cap gun. They fall next to me on the floor. Stephen says something about Tracy Chapman drinking Budweiser. I think: Why would Tracy Chapman drink Budweiser? I imagine she'd boycott it or something, but not drink it! So I bet Stephen $20 that she doesn't drink Budweiser. He and I shake hands. Tracy Chapman then comes over to the table, walking behind me, and sits on my left. As she does this, I ask her if she drinks Budweiser. She says yes, and sets a bottle of Budweiser on the table in front of her as she sits down. Stephen and Kevin laugh. I think Stephen must have seen her drinking this before the bed, so I don't intend to pay him, and I don't think he'll be too concerned about enforcing the bet he cheated somewhat by tricking me. Tracy Chapman, who seems like Tracy Bonham, is then white, and I think she's cute. She and Melanie are both sympathetic that I had to pay, and they both give me a portion of a roll of caps, which is a symbol that I've paid. Hanna knows I didn't pay because I didn't have my hand stamped. Others who haven't paid pay now. I get a beer. Tracy says I should ask her next time and she would get me a beer, and implies everything will go smooth with paying to get in. I get up, acting obnoxiously, and pretend that I'm giving Hanna my Budweiser beer. She grabs it and we get into a tug-of-war. I win, as she pulls the cap of the bottle. To spite her, I slam the beer, gulp by gulp, though it takes me a while to drink the whole beer. I show my contempt for her."

I start to give fellatio. I put his penis deep into my throat. His penis stays fairly limp, and he moans a lot. I move my finger down towards his anus, which is wet, but he doesn't want me to stimulate his anus, and declines this. I ask him to give me anal sex. He is going to, and I tell him to use a condom. My backpack, which has condoms in it, is on the door handle. I tell him to use a lot of lotion. He is about to penetrate me when the door opens. My high school classmate Elise Rooks walks in, as if the room we're in is a bathroom. I grab a towel as she enters, wrap it around me, and walk out of the room to the bathroom. Elise finds Seth naked with an erection, wearing a condom, and she knows what was happening. At that instant everyone seems to know. I go to the shower. A man is there with a baby in his arms. He pushes a door closed on my while I'm outside the bathroom on a small deck-like area. He tries to lock me out of the bathroom. He is mad at me for my homosexual acts. I push the door open and go inside. Downstairs, others are disgusted and angry with me for my homosexual acts. There is an upheaval of the family here, at what seems to be a family reunion. Many people react strongly, and are homophobic. One or two people say my behavior is okay. I tell everyone I called the police and everyone, including family, has ten minutes to leave. I'm out in front of the house. My ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas is there in a group. She tells me she found number two, implying this is her number two male partner. She does this to taunt me. She and her group, which includes my high school friend Holly Ball, start to walk away. They taunt me. I pick up bottles that are lying around and throw them into our yard to consolidate the mess. Two houses down, the yard is filled with heaps of empty plastic Pepsi bottles, and others bottles. There are two young black kids in this yard. One is between eight and ten years old, the other between 12 and 13. I tell them if the mess in their yard is from our party than I'll clean it up. They say it is from our party. I'm prepared to take care of it. Their reply is very shaky, and I question them again. They admit the mess is from a party held at their house by their father. I want to run over to the group leaving and tell Annie and those taunting me to eat a big fat dick: to fuck off! Then they walk beside me. I tell Annie I don't want to talk to her anymore. Holly and Annie walk and pester me. My academic advisor Mary Monroe is there. Our house is bluish-gray in color. In and around the house are many skulls and bloody, fleshy body parts and limbs of small dinosaurs scattered about. There are several old men in the house to assess the house. One of the men is a dinosaur specialist. I ask him how the place looks. He says it is littered with skulls. My friends Beth Mock, Brittany Johnson, and others that I don't want to see are there. I pick up glasses on and around the floor."

I need to do some business at the bank, including getting traveler's checks. Nat gives me a $5 bill to get him a container of Globe Lights cigarettes. I hesitate briefly, wondering if he should smoke in the car with my mom and Ramona as we drive, and wondering why he doesn't get them himself. We seem to be driving a red car, like my friend Nate Nelling's family's car. I go in and wait in the bank line for a bit, and then decide to get the cigarettes first because the bank lines are long. The tag under the plastic container of Globe Lights says $3.88. I ask the man behind the counter for a bottle of Globe Lights. I feel a bit funny because I've never purchased cigarettes. Bat told me to keep some, but not all, of the change. The man gives me three small buckets with ice in them, three plastic cups, and a larger bucket. He says something to me along the lines of, \"Think before you drink and drive.\" I don't hear him clearly, and I jokingly ask him if he said \"Mix your drinks before you drink them.\" The total bill is $1.18. I give the man a $10 bill. He gives me over $15 in change, as if I've paid with a $20 bill. I'm a bit confused, because I'm sure I paid with a $10 bill, but I'm not going to say anything. I go back to the bank teller line. I have a white plastic bag with all the drink buckets and glasses in it. I get up to a teller after some confusion with others in line. My bag is now a cardboard box, about 12\"x4\"x8\" in dimension. I ask the male teller if I can get $200 in travelers' checks. He doesn't know about these, and has to ask someone else. He returns and tells me to go around the corner and ask Dee ___ (I forget). I go around the corner and ask a woman. She shows me to a door that enters into a room where a woman is sitting at a table. The woman at the table is Dee, and she asks if she can assist me in getting travelers checks. I say yes, and ask her how long it takes to order them. She replies that it takes two working days. I think about this: When I'd be able to get the checks, when I'm going back to Woodland, and how I'd coordinate it. It seems rushed, in a time crunch."

There is a large farm/garden area around the house. The family is at home. I see a large shadow of a low-flying plane on the ground. Looking up, I see many planes flying overhead. The planes drop bombs all around. I see the bombs falling and I flee, running back into the field. The place where the bombing occurs seems to be Yardville. The planes circle down and land very quickly. This is an invasion of the country by Nazi-like soldiers with small green fighter planes. I run, and my mom runs, following me. I want to escape the invaders. We run into the cornfield, going west to escape. We run away from roads, into the country, around lakes and ponds, and through some ponds. We jump in one of the ponds to cool off. Kids are playing near some of the water holes. It is getting dark. I am then with my brother Wally, not my mom. We come to a huge rock cliff that is covered with plastic, secured with tape. We walk around the edge of this rock that is at least a few hundred feet in circumference and a hundred feet tall. I find a spot and we slip underneath the tarp where there is an opening. We walk here in an open space, and come to a door. Looking through a small rectangular window in the door I see a large concrete bridge and know there is a town there. The town seems to have a \"saving\" quality to it: it will save or help us in some way. We walk out through the door, going from the rock and water country to the town, and into a city. We walk down stairs. The city we are in is Rome. We cross a rope bridge while two men walk the opposite way across it. We may not be fully clothed. The two men seem to be wearing towels. I'm in a building that seems to be like Brimson, and I realize I'm safe. I see my friend Nat Miller and my uncle Rusty Redding. I talk with Nat about the invasion. He tells me it was either Holland or Germany that invaded. His study abroad program ended early because of the invasion. My friend Stephen Ramos is there. He talks about his experience of the invasion. He was in bed masturbating when the invaders landed, and before he knew it they had captured him. They tell me that people have been looking for me since the invasion: I've been missing. I quietly take pride in my escaping the invasion. I am safe in Rome. I think of talking to some psychology professors about the invasion, since I'm here."

I have a drawing of a gorilla in my stack of drawings, which I flip through. I'm in an elevator with Grace. We seem to be on a floor where there is a bad man who wants to capture Grace. He thinks that I'm on his side: that since I'm with Grace that I've captured her. He asks me if I want to bring her back and take care of her, or if he should. I tell him I will, knowing that he has no idea I've duped him and have no intentions of capturing her. I try to catch the man off guard and kick him, to injure, kill, or disable him. My kick is short, and I try to change it into a smoother, more controlled motion so he'll think I'm just joking. I then attack him with all my strength. He has a can of some spray that does serious damage to a person, and a gun. I flight with him, avoiding the spray and kicking the gun out of his hand. Then I'm in an elevator as it closes. This is a terrible position to be in because Grace is outside with the man. He knows I'm in the elevator, and can corner me when I try to get out. There is a big tent in a white bag in the elevator. I dump it out and grab a long aluminum tent pole, which is bent, to use as a weapon. I emerge from the elevator on the same floor as the man, and he attacks. I fight him off. I'm fighting my classmate at Brimson, Arnold, and another short, thin blond haired man. I smash their heads together and smash them on the marble floor of what seems to be a church."

On my first toss the coin lands on its side on my jeans, so I toss it again. One of the men says something about the correct direction to flip a coin. I get a heads on the second toss, which is what I had called. The coin looks like a penny, but has an entire body on it, instead of just a head. I wonder what kind of beer to get. The two men who work there aren't much help in figuring this out. They don't seem to want to give me a beer. One of them makes a comment about Busch Light and a case day. I have a shovel, which is like a spade with a flatter scoop. I point it at people, as if it were a gun, and jerk it back towards me, as if I had just fired it and it had recoil. There are some women in the bar. Several of them leave, and then come back in carrying crates of full milk jugs.  There is a princess-like girl that is 14 years old. She has many suitors who come to have sex with her. There is a woman who watches over the princess, like a maid or attendant. This woman is cute. I'm standing outside the window of the princess' room. The maid is in the room, but the princess is not. There is a man in the room too. The maid says that it's okay for the princess to have suitors during the day, but not at night. I climb in through the window. The mother of the princess arrives in a car outside. I crouch down, to avoid being seen. A young man in a delivery truck pulls up right next to the room. He takes a pair of jeans and tosses them into the room at the maid. He is courting the maid and she snubs him: she doesn't like him. The delivery boy walks into the room. I approach him, somewhat out of protection for the maid, but I don't necessarily think she wants me to do this. The boy is short and skinny. I tower over him. I ask him to teach me to walk sideways on some narrow, beamlike structure outside. We go to the edge of the room, outside. There is an army man walking up a ramp to the room. He is fairly dangerous and belligerent. The boy pushes me out onto the beam and pulls the pen that I always carry out of my back pocket. The pan is what will allow me to walk or stand slanted or sideways. I regain my balance and push the delivery boy into the arms of the army man, who is behind him. This seems to be doom or death for the boy. I run! I go away from the army man. I run to my home, go inside, and lock all the doors. I go upstairs, and then go downstairs. The front door is then wide open and the piano is playing by itself, as if an invisible person is playing it. I don't see a person, but someone must be there. I lash out, but touch nothing. I run outside with fear, wondering who or what is there. I see a lamb, a whale, and other objects that appear before my eyes. I get near the back door, where there is a sign. It has writing on it, something like, \"What is chasing me?\", or \"What am I chasing?\" I stop and think: what am I scared of? What part of me am I running from?"

I've heard vaguely of one or two; others I'm not familiar with. They are Saft, Ditzen or Dizy, and others. My dad is at a bookstore while we talk. He tells me there will be a reading of these authors at a bookstore on June 5th, 1998. At first I thought he had bought me some books, then he tells me they'll be reading. I'm in the basement pit room at home in Oak Valley talking on the phone. I have several eggs. One egg is cracked, with a blob of egg white hanging out. I tell my dad I'd like to go to the reading but I'll still be in Australia on June 5th. It seems like I haven't left the United States yet. Carl Jung will be there! I really want to go! My dad has reserved two tickets for the reading on his credit card. I tell him I'll try to change my schedule to make it home on June 2nd or 3rd. I remember that the Raden University packet warned against taking exams early. My dad says okay, and our conversation seems about to end. Because of this burst of excitement and enthusiasm I want to tell him the dream I had last night in which he and I told each other I love you. I'm in my mom's bedroom looking north out the east window. I'm about to tell my dad the dream when I see five suns out the window. They are larger than usual: about twice as large as normal, and they are glowing. I stop and look at them. They are brilliant! I tell him to quick look out of his window and I run outside to look. As I run outside I see a reflection in the glass that makes me think that the five suns were really just a tricky splitting of light rays, like a prism. But I feel I can't back down from what I've said, because I've made a big deal of it, so I go out to look. It is cloudy outside. I see the suns as if they were in front of the clouds, large and glowing, in the formation of the five dots on a die. My brother Wally is there with his friends Perry Glyde and Mryle Madden. Perry or Mryle has my pocket notebook. I get it from them and scramble to write, to capture the moment. I see letters, numbers, and symbols on the suns, including 18hr or 18rh. I try to write these down. I'm still on the phone with my dad this whole time. I'm talking loud and fast. I'm very excited about what I'm seeing, as if it is a vision or is prophetic."

I'm there to buy some leg weights so I can do the leg exercises while I'm in New South Wales to alleviate my knee pain. I test the electrical wiring of an item by plugging in several connections. A bulb lights up so I know the wiring is okay. My junior high classmate Ben Kator is there. He says his name and says something to be about getting the store employee who is in the attic. I don't recognize him at first, but then I remember him. The employee comes down from the attic. I wander up to the counter to pay for my leg weights. I have looked at several different sizes and weights. The employee rings it up to a total of $14.80. I start pulling out $24.80, so I can get a $10 bill back. The man grabs a handful of my coins and counts out 80 cents: three quarters and a nickel. He then slides the 80 cents towards him with his left hand and slides another bunch of coins towards him with his right hand, also taking the paper bills. I confront him on this, and call him a thief because I caught him. I say that a few coins aren't a big deal, but he is stealing. I ask him if there is a manager I can talk to. He says yes, and points to an office where I see a blue collar somewhat white trash stressed out greasy alcoholic-type person talking business on the phone. I wait for the manager, standing at the counter with the employee/thief. We talk about hard financial times: stealing while grocery shopping. The employee says that everyone steals. I tell him honestly that I don't. I'm waiting outside the manager's door. The employee enters the office and puts a dollar bill on the desk while the manager is still on the phone, as a bribe. It is the excess money in the till from stealing. He then comes and offers me a $40, $10, and $1 bill to keep quiet. I yell out, \"Don't try to bribe me!\" The manager is off the phone, and is standing right behind me. The employee lost his job at that moment, and leaves. I look at the store, which is on the hill as I look up towards the big oak tree and machine shed at the farm. The store is a mess: very unorganized, and things are falling apart. Three customers approach. The manager will need to run the store. I wait for the manager, to ask him if he needs good help: a good employee. Looking at the mess I know I could be more organized, efficient, and clean. I seem to be around Brimson, and am thinking of this job as a weekend job."

The woman tells us she's done this. I ask her questions to determine if she did it correctly. I say to the man, \"...so you're from Canada...\". He says no, his wife is from Canada: I have misunderstood. The couple is not married: he isn't wearing a ring. The man explains about his wife and he, and while he's talking he says, in passing, \"...When Jerry died...\". I'm shocked to hear this: I'm thinking of my professor Jerry Rice. I look at Hilary, and she confirms my dismay: Jerry Rice died last night. The woman there had been an adviser to or had known Jerry somehow. I am deeply saddened, and roll to the floor on my knees, crying. I leave, walking north to Carter Church in Oak Valley, which is a short walk. I look for a funeral notice on the doors of the church, and seeing none, remember that Jerry is Jewish, so I'll call the Jewish funeral homes around. I walk into the church and notice that a young man with dark hair has followed me there to see that I made it okay. In the church are a half-dozen people who seem to be coordinating or running the church. I see my friend Sara Miller. She is very happy to see me, and is loquacious and smiley. I am somber, and say nothing. I leave with her out the sacristy door and walk home with her and my grade school classmate Brownie Bruny. There is ice and snow on the ground: it's winter. Someone mentions that if the cement of a sidewalk is exposed, uncovered from the snow and ice for at least 24 hours, then people have a right to dig there, with a ditch-digger or a backhoe! My family is staying elsewhere for a few days after the death. I go to the new residence. It is my old neighbor Donald Branson's old house. I kick the door open loudly because my hands are full. There are two dinner tables. I see a family that is like the Flanders family on the television show the Simpsons at one table, and my mom and my brother Wally at the other table. We are sharing with this family for now. I set my load down and tell everyone about Jerry's death. I say what Jerry meant to me: that he was a facilitator: he allowed me the extra freedom to do my own thing. We're all having homemade pasta and steak for dinner. Some of the boys from the other family come to introduce themselves to me. One of them is named Tod. Another boy tells me to say \"farmers\" and then he squeezes my cheeks together as I say the \"ers\" portion of the word, so his name sounds like \"Farmears\", but is spelled Farmers. They pick up small, arranged strands of colored pasta from my plate. This is a really artsy, fancy, finicky, almost childish way to prepare pasta, and I'm kind of annoyed by it. I think of my honors proposal, and if I should get in touch with someone else to write the recommendation for it."

I say, \"Why don't I throw it in the microwave for a minute?\", which seems like the usual thing to do with a drawing.

The captain sees a problem with the ropes for the sails, from a distance, and he yells and quickly goes to correct the sail problem. The sails are lifted up all the way, and then let swing down, all in a plane, attached to a rope. The problem is caught and people try to fix it, but it takes some time. The captain says the last six ships with this problem sank! The boat spins in circles and gets out of the predicament."

Annie has a few pimples on her back, and a scratch with a chunk of skin missing, which doesn't seem like her. She has on white boxer-brief underwear. It's later in the night, then. I awaken and Annie isn't there. Ray Jackson, an acquaintance, is sitting on the floor. I'm shocked and extremely surprised to see someone there! I am hostile at first, saying to him, \"What the fuck are you doing here?\" Then I calm down. I think this must be a dream. I grab Ray's shoe, with his foot in it. It is solid, and I conclude that this isn't a dream. I wonder, and ask where he came from. I am baffled that he is in my room. He seems surprised and confused that he's there, as if he doesn't know how he got there. He tells me he came to see my sister Heather the other day. I believe him. This is his reason for being here. I had grabbed a knife, believing that he was an intruder: someone in the form of him, but not actually him. I put the knife, which is my army knife, down. The attic door, which is in my bedroom at home, is open. There is a picture on the wall that is tilted or fallen of an angel or spirit woman, like the picture that my dad gave Heather a while back. I look down at my clock on the floor, spilling a cup of water near my bed as the blankets fall on the floor. It's about 6:30am. The blankets on my bed are those from my flat on Ocean Avenue. I'm wearing underwear, and I cover up with a sheet, sitting or standing to deal with Ray. I may grab the knife again."

My fourth or fifth shot hits Wally directly in the chest. There is hole in his chest, and a pause. His body is then ripped apart, blown to pieces in fire, ashes, and explosions, with blood and fire mixed, spread out like sunrays in all directions. He blows up, burning and bleeding. I see his form, his shape, as it explodes. He asks me, \"What did you do that for?\", in such a tone that I feel guilty for shooting him with a grenade. He is alive shortly. I run away. I feel terrible that I have killed him. It is a premature killing. I run past the garage, plum trees, chicken coops, and into the cornfield.

The car leaves the ground when going over the railroad tracks, and we bounce around. I verbally reprimand him for speeding and not stopping at the stop signs. It reminds me of the big black man who gave a talk at Armstrong High School about \"cruising along\" at 80 miles per hour. I think of the speaker's friend who died in a car crash. My dad doesn't take me seriously. I tell him I don't want him or I to get hurt. He accepts my concern more when I express it this way. He says okay, but still drives fast on a narrow road. I feel drunk. I know I couldn't control the car at this speed if I were driving this fast on these roads. I have my fishing rod. There is a bell sinker tied to the end of the line. I pull on the line, which is old and nicked up. The line snaps. I take the rod apart and pull the line off the spool. We are at a park shelter-like area. There are many wooden artifacts that seem to be antiques. We walk through this place. There is a very tall large man there in a brown cloak with big scruffy hair. He is very frightening looking. He speaks a few words, neutrally and informatively, which give me a different impression of him. I have a ring made of wood, about ten inches in diameter, with the wood about two inches in diameter. We come upon a field where there is a wooded hill on our right in front of us. My dad yells crazily at a man named Pete or Pat, who is playing ultimate Frisbee with a group of men. There are one or two small swimming pools on our left, and a steep hill in front of us. We start walking up the hill, climbing and grabbing the grass for a grip. The grass rips out, and it is very difficult to climb. I slip and fall back down. At the top are Rita Fosters, an acquaintance, her sister, and others. They are sitting on towels because they just went swimming. It is cold outside. My friend Stephanie Peterson is at the top of the hill. I try to climb up, but the grass rips out and I slide down. My old landlord Bill Miller is approaching a house, which may be our house, at the top of the hill. I really want to get to the house to see what he wants. I try to run up the hill, and fail. Stephanie slips and flips down the hill. I deftly catch her and set up upright. I want to see what Bill needs or wants, but I can't make it up the hill."

I think there are only two outs. We're up to bat. My friend Gino Teavor is leading off, followed by my friend Norman Noman, then myself. There are many short, light bats. I look for one to use. I find the old black and gray bat that my brother Wally and I used to have as kids: I really like it. Gino may get on base. Norman hits a two-run homerun over the left field fence, down the third baseline. There is a large metal structure in left field that Gino makes a catch by jumping over. He may have caught a fly ball that he hit. There is a large net stretched across the inner outfield, from left to right field. It effectively prevents any homerun balls. I come up to bat and take two balls. I foul one pitch off to the right, then foul one off to the left. I chase bad pitches that are too fast for me with the intention of crushing one for a homerun. I swing and miss, and think it's the second strike, not remembering one of the foul balls. The catcher points out that I struck out. I realize this, and step away from home plate. I feel humbled, like I know I shouldn't be thinking about hitting a homerun, but that is a dream: a fantasy that captivates me."

I'm trying to catch the big eel on a rubber cord with a bit of food attached to the end of it. I dive back down. The eel eats the food. The eel is my study abroad coordinator Jessie Sanders. I wonder how I will catch her if there is no hook on the cord: if I pull on the cord it will just come out of the eel's mouth. She eats the food, partially swallowing the cord. I grab her body by the waist and hips and spin her around so the cord wraps tightly around her neck. She resists but is weak compared to my strength. I easily wrap the cord around her neck tightly a few times. The cord is like wire. She chokes."

She says, \"Whitman\", but she is unsure. I interact with some people near the front of a store there. They give me Zima sandwiches, which are turkey, for free. I'm happy to have free food. I get in the drivers seat of a white truck. It is a stick shift. There is another truck there that is black. My dad is in the truck, but at first I know this person to be someone different. We begin to drive, going a short distance. My dad is in front of us on a golf cart. We're driving by what seems to be Railroad Company softball parks. My dad tips his golf cart, turning while going too fast. We stop. My dad has injured his shoulder in the fall. There is a brace on his shoulder. He may have aggravated a previous injury. He decides not to spelunk with us. He has had 31 hours of sleep in some period of time and decides to rest his shoulder."

I get closer as I walk by and see it is my high school classmate Emilio Kluck. He is hiding in a cornfield-like area. I don't pursue him. I come to the Jefferson School tennis courts. I meet my friend Stephen Ramos. We hug. I have missed him. We jokingly have fake sex. I am cautious to retain my personal space. My grade schoolmates Ray and Hal Jackson are there. Ray has a red sports car with door that open upwards. The car has only 50,000 miles on it. Ray has some handguns there, for him. I think this is inappropriate: what will he need a gun for? We begin to walk. Ray urinates in front of cars as we walk. This embarrasses me. I'm at a building that is for a Preppy Printers. There are stacks of pallets being moved around. The number of pallets is implied by someone to be the number of kids that a couple has. This number is greater than the number of times the couple has had sex, the person says! I argue that isn't possible. Henry Jackson produces a double-barreled shotgun that is a handgun with a scope! It is high-tech. Others, including Ray, have guns hidden, in cases. I ask why they need all the guns. They reply that their own family has shot them at: relatives! I haul in grocery carts that are sunk completely in mud. It is a cold, cloudy day. The ground is muddy brown. There is a man overseeing work. Henry and the man want to get as many carts stored away in different places as possible, to save space in the main room for a stock of carts. I talk with Ray about my wages, being critical of what I earn. Ray says we're all paid well. While this is true when we were young, it was because we were young: grunt workers. I know Ray and Hal get paid very well by their father, so Ray is biased in his opinion of the wages. I'm working odds and ends, like at Preppy Printers: shit jobs. I move and organize shoes, cleaning up."

He says or implies that it's not something he wants to do, but as a last resort he declares Martial Law in the country. He may declare this just in New York. It affects me where I am. Martial Law means that, for the time, there are no laws! All the regular laws are suspended. It is, to some degree, a state of crisis. I'm excited and scared by this. There is potential for extensive damage, destruction, and suffering. Clinton recommends that we form civil squads, which I know are groups of civilians that have banded together for protection and other reasons. We pull into a McDonalds parking lot. Three of my Redding family aunts are sitting in the lot. I wave at them. It then seems I'm driving. I look for a place to park. I drive past a parking space, then backup and try to park there. As I do this, another car driven by a woman nears the space. I stick my middle finger up at the woman driving, to rudely let her know not to take my space. It is later. The man I'm with says we should look into getting more burgers for the night since Martial Law has been declared. I'm with my sister Heather and her friend at home. I tell Heather what Martial Law means. She is surprised and shocked. At one point I'm worried for my own safety and the security of my house and room. I'm on the phone with my mom. I'm talking while standing near a large body of water with a high tower or platform area that my brother Wally and my cousin Archie Weber jump off. My mom is then there. It's a bright sunny morning. Martial Law ended this morning at 6:00 or 7:00 am. My mom says that her sister Elaine Grains went to commit suicide this morning, but didn't go through with it. My dad is there, as is a man operating a boat. We all haul items, at one time carrots and fresh vegetables, across water in a slow and careful process. It takes a while because of the outboard motors and the shallow water. Later, the cargo is two baking pans. I'm in a wood shack near the water. It is a bathroom, but doesn't have the features of a bathroom, like a toilet or sink. I look in the rafters of this shack. I'm in a cottage with a group of people cleaning up after guests. There are moldy bagels there. The guests have left a lot of food in the refrigerator. I want to keep it and eat it. I'm in a hair salon. I see my grade school classmate Karen Kipp. I'm in a place where I see a mother and her two daughters eating sub sandwiches from Subway. At some point I seem to be in a donut shop as well. There is a storage room that I am shown, with others, where I try to fit myself with an appropriate length walking cane. There are televisions around the outer room. A group is gathering. Video games are connected to the televisions."

We get up in the air high and can see the town of Boston in the distance, with all its suburbs. We fly over a suburb that extends to a point on a narrow peninsula. There is one private house on the peninsula surrounded by clear turquoise water. The house is obviously owned by wealthy people. It has a swimming pool and a meticulously kept lush green lawn. This is a place or suburb called Owen, and it is Cape Cod, a very nice, posh place to live. I see gourmet snack food delights laid out along the poolside. It is a beautiful place, with blue water and a clear sky. My housemate Glen Ryan is with me. I'm inside the house flipping through the television channels with the remote control.

When we reach a certain point the instructor flips a switch and the cockpit opens. The two people running in front get in the cockpit as the people in the rear continue to run along the back of the plane. When the front two people are in the plane, then the back two get in. The plane then takes off. All this happens over a very short distance, in tight areas where the plane is being steered through trees and buildings. I'm on the front left side of the plane. We begin to run and Fiona hops in. I climb up to get in but have trouble and see an ominous pillar in front of us that is just at my level, stretched across the makeshift runway. I hop up onto the pillar as we get near it, and the plane goes underneath it. The flight instructor looks back and sees me standing atop the pillar. He gives me a look as if I should have hopped down the other side of the pillar and landed in the plane as it came out from underneath the pillar. But, the plane is turned around and we try again. It's later. I'm in a room with the people I flew with. We have won one of the plane races, maybe because others let us win. It was our first race attempt that we won. I'm happy enough with this. I think we should all take a photograph. Everyone is wearing yellow and blue rain jackets. One of the men is cooking a pot roast in a microwave oven, which is actually an oven. There are fixings with the roast. The man seems like Mick from the university caving club."

I point out Trout Mountain as we walk: a snow covered peak off to our left. We'll have to walk back to Eagle Lake and then portage to Trout Lake. We walk on an ice and snow covered, plowed, road. On our left is a frozen lake with an ice fishing house on it, as well as other house and huts. We continue to walk north towards Eagle Lake. Cars drive by us on the road. I think this area has really been opened up for use, and I think it's dangerous that the roads are so icy and we're walking against oncoming cars. We continue to walk back towards our group. Our dog is with us. There are many dogs across the road from us. At first I think they may be Timberwolves, but they aren't. We go past several men on snowmobiles. I have a snowmobile then, and I cruise up to the group that is walking towards us. My high school teammate Ron Lind is in the group. He has long hair. I ask my friend Kevin Simpson where to go. We decide to go to Trout Lake. We're all at the public landing at Eagle Lake. It's a beautiful day. Kevin puts a spare key for his truck inside a key holder and places it in my jeans pocket. I think this is a good idea: we'll each have a key then. Kevin's watch says it's 8:30am. My watch says 10:30am. We're heading out with a group of people new to this area: rookies. I'm excited about our trip. I'm very anal retentive about the details of the trip, because I want everything to be perfect. I'm so picky I may detract from people's experience, and my own. I ask my high school classmate Tanya Simmons and another woman where they want to camp tonight: on an island or around here on the shore? They say it makes no difference, but Tanya seems to hint at the shore. I suggest an island because the breeze will keep the bugs away. Our goal is to make it to Trout Lake (on the first day?). I'm really excited about camping on Trout Lake. My friends Tim and Niles Zelling have a big red tent and a red tarp with. One of the women has a big puffy red sleeping bag with no stuff sack or cover for it. I say the one thing that we absolutely need is to stay dry! I make the woman walk down to Fishing Haven and buy some garbage bags. One shore, a man and his son are fishing. The boy, who is three or four, catches a nice smallmouth bass. The bass gets off the hook right near shore, and starts to flop and wriggle back into the water. My brother Wally is knee deep in the water. He grabs the fish as it tries to swim away. They have caught a two-headed fish: the bodies of two fish are connected at the tails. The fish is going to die. I try to revive it. It is a white platypus-like fish at one end and a smallmouth bass or a northern pike at the other end. I can't revive the fish. I think of getting my knife, to cut the tails and save one of the two fish, but they can't be revived. I'm meticulous and anal retentive about all the details and everyone's packing. I want everyone to have a good trip, and am looking out for those who haven't experienced this before. I realize I may be overbearing."

I'm near the Uptown Theatre. The old couple is there; I talk with them. The man is wearing an akubra. I ask them, \"Didn't I see you on the way home from Australia?\" The man says yes: they were on the same plane as I. We talk briefly. I ask them how their holiday was. The man offers to take me hunting. I'm happy and surprised, and ask, \"What do you hunt?\" He answers, \"Tobacco.\" I'm surprised by this, but will give it a try. I tell him I'll give him a call or stop by later: he only lives down Home Avenue in Oak Valley, just south of 2nd Street. I walk over to the movie theatre. I hold a rolled cigarette in my hand as I walk. I see my brother and his friend Mryle Madden, and greet them. Mryle is terse. He is three or four inches taller than I. He has a drink, but doesn't want to drink tonight, so I get his drink and consume most of his Screwdriver. I give it back to him, saying that the orange juice is sour. He agrees. I see my high school classmate Justin Michaels with a false razor blade cut on his left cheek and artificial blood on his face, in the triangular shape of pork chop side burns. I walk over to the movie ticket line. A woman who is above the line in a balcony-like area or on a roof, yells out to me that I'm going to throw up. I know this is asinine. I had one drink in a few seconds, and I hold a lot more alcohol than that before I get sick. I walk through the line to get up to a group of people I know, because one person waved at me earlier when I was standing next to Wally and Mryle. I carry liquid in a cup or bowl. I'm careful not to spill it. I walk past many familiar faces, including my high school classmate Helen Cullen. I see a person who looks like my childhood friend Helen Vader. I say to her, \"Helen Vader?\" She turns and acknowledges me: it's her. Behind her is her brother, Trevor, whom I haven't seen in many years. We shake hands. He is tall, and has put on weight. He ahs darker brown greasy hair, and glasses. Another woman there shakes my hand, and introduces herself as Helen Burger: a friend of mom's. We all talk. Someone comments about me coming to a movie by myself: they are impressed. I try to think of what movie to see; all the movies look unfamiliar to me. I see the title for a Simpson's movie, and I don't know if it's about the television cartoon family the Simpson's, but I go to it anyway. The movie begins like the television show. Homer Simpson is in the bathtub, and he puts Bart in charge for the day so he can masturbate with a bar of soap while in the tub. It seems to be me in the tub: I see myself there."

That team scores a goal very quickly: minutes after the game has started. There is a young player on the team named Jeff. He is very cocky. I go up to him and call him over to the side; He isn't playing at the time. I warn him that though he is a good player he needs to put a little more effort into his sport: to not slack off, but keep honing his skills or he may suffer the consequences. He leaves the area with his girlfriend. He may be wearing a blue jersey. The announcer comes over the loudspeaker with the scorer and time of the goal. He then says that Jeff has been kicked off the team. I walk up a path away from the field. It's difficult to walk: I go slowly, and limp. I move in slow motion. I walk by an open, fenced in area, on my right; maybe tennis courts. I can see people sitting inside the area, but can't distinguish them. I walk by a group of people on the side of the path. A woman with long blond wavy hair waves at me. I wave back at her without stopping. I pass another, smaller, group, where an identical looking woman with long blond hair says hi to me. I say hi back to her without stopping. I think the blond women may be identical twins; they are very pretty. A strong collie-like dog with orange/gold/brown fur prances around. I call the dog, but it won't strictly follow me. It runs up to a small hill on the path and stops, turning back. When I get up to the hilltop I see that down below is a zoo. Two large black bears are being trained for photographs. The dog was scared, so I go on a different path off to the right. I walk down in an area where trees have been cut and the stumps remain in a field. A house is on my right. I job briskly down this downward sloping path. I'm on a wooden path, and I hop briskly from log to log. The dog goes its own way, up the slope to the right. I walk on and come to a wooded area. I think I see a deer, and slow down, realizing it would be spooked already if it were a deer. I slowly walk and do see deer. I see a four-point buck with a large rack, 12-15 inches high. I also see a six-point buck. The deer seem to be everywhere! I see eight to ten very large deer, at least 180-200 pounds each. They dash away as I approach. I watch. I continue on through the small forest and enter a shack. There are three men in the warm shack, which is adorned with antiques on the walls: very cozy. One of the men says he started work at the shack today, which is a little cafe/supply store. They ask me if I have land around here. I tell them yes, thinking that the Ramos' land is around here, but then I realize I'm in New South Wales. I talk about the deer I just saw, and they say it's a good thing this is a shotgun hunting zone (because the shack is so close). There are many deer around, and since my friends the Ramos' and I are to hunt in a few days, the prospects look good. The working man says he has two kids that are hiding behind the counter because they've never heard a shotgun blast before. I leave. I'm in a very old pickup truck with two men my age, one on each side of me, two older men, and one or two younger kids. We drive. I want to make it to a football game where my housemate Glen Ryan is. I need to find the Dark Green Stadium where the game is being played. I may somehow get there in the truck. The man on my right pinches my thigh/butt. There is not much room in the truck: we're packed in standing. I grab his hand and tell him to stop. He continues to pinch my thigh and butt, and gets the man on my left to pinch my thigh and butt on the left side. I'm fed up with this. I punch the man on my left squarely in the nose with my right fist, and then elbow the man on my right. I yell to be let out of the truck: I'm in the company of mid 1900's rednecks! The driver stops and I get out, grabbing my green and red sweatshirt. The man that was on my right gets out after me. He it tall and strong, with short, neatly combed hair: a homegrown farm boy! We fight. I think that he has the size and strength advantage. I punch him three times in the testicles with my left hand and smash his face into the truck and ground while I hold the back of his head with my right hand. The other man my age gets out of the truck. I punch and beat him as well. I then hurry away from those hillbillies for fear that they may pursue me. The area I walk in is an old 1950's city, but fully functioning. It's being built at the same time. It is cloudy. I walk or jog along a road, hopping over logs, kitchen plates, and armchairs that are lying around because of the construction. A sidewalk is being built. The white cement looks modern in contrast to the old-fashioned town. I get to the football stadium and enter. The bleachers don't go up very high: it's an old stadium, uncovered. As soon as I enter the quarterback of the driving team makes a long pass that goes over the end zone and nearly hits a lady in the head as she walks out the door, about three feet away from me! I walk and look for Glen. The stadium is small and made completely of wood. It looks brown on the inside. Two men approach me, one on each side, and grab me. I am moved into a corner where one of the men stands in front of me. He is wearing gray. The other man takes a photograph of the man and I with a camera that has a large lens on it: very high tech. They seem to do this to somehow get a false identification card because they're younger than I: about 16 years old. I wrap my right arm around the head and neck of the man in front of me and threaten to break his neck if he doesn't leave me alone. Several of their companions show up. One shorter man deems their behavior useless, and slices an identification card in half with another identification card. I continue on. There is not much space in the stadium. People sit on picnic tables. I walk by and see my grade school classmate Ray Jackson sitting at a table. Immediately I recognize that I'm dreaming because Ray is not in New South Wales with me: he's in the United States. I say out loud, \"I'm dreaming\" at the exact same time that Ray looks at me and says, \"You're dreaming\". As I say \"I'm\" he says \"You're\", and our saying \"Dreaming\" coincides. I float or fly backwards, away from the table where Ray is. I will myself to fly towards Ray, and I do. He is then outside. I fly left, passing through a window without breaking it, and fly after him. He flies faster than I: I can't catch up to him. He has honed and practiced his flying skills. I follow him distantly, flying over trees. I fly upwards into white clouds and fog. I can't see anything. I fly in loops, arching my back, like I am a roller coaster. I try to fly back down to the ground. I can't see myself. I may make it down to the ground, but if I do I can't get a clear image of the stadium or the people. I can't seem to stop flying, so I open my eyes (in real life)."

She speaks on the radio as she drives, communicating with the bus station base to let them know we're in dangerous conditions, and that they should check in on us if they don't hear from us in a while. We ride over the Dirty River bridge to the Riverside School area. We're returning then, after having gone somewhere. We don't know whether to get off the bus at my dad and Lisa's house. We drive by and see they are there, so we get off the bus. I have a case of returnable beer bottles. We walk up to the house. It seems to be an open area. I say hi to my stepbrother Gary Lawson and his girlfriend after he acknowledges me. When he sees me we greet each other superficially. He doesn't say much. His girlfriend say they're drunk: they were at a party, to which they are now going back with my brother Wally and his friend Mryle Madden. My stepbrother Nan Lawson is there, as is my dad. I open my case of beer, which feels remarkably light, and see it's half empty. The bottles that are in it are old. There are some dented cans with $5 price tags on them and some tiny one-inch tall bottles: A real crappy stock of beer. Everyone is wearing or changing into bathing suits. Mryle is wearing a light blue Speedo. The others have two or three cases of returnable bottles as well."

My friend Becky Muldoon and another woman are living there as well. The man has meat sitting out on the counter ready to cook. Becky, the woman, and I are about to cook a breakfast of eggs. I'd like hash browns as well. The midget has ordered light bulbs to be delivered to our place to replace the ones that burned out in the flat. The delivery and bulb costs are our expense. We are all upset at the man because of this. We tell him that we don't need to have all the bulbs in place until our flat inspection on May 14th. We are angry, but try to express our feelings tactfully. The delivery man arrives driving a white truck, which he parks in the alley- I'm at home now in Oak Valley. The delivery man comes in with three light bulbs and the midget pays him $14. We feel angry because we had no choice in the decision-making. Even though the midget paid, somehow, we are paying for this. The delivery man and the midget leave. The midget stays for a bit outside on his motorcycle-like vehicle. I take the bulbs. One is five or six inches in diameter. I hold it from the bulb portion and inadvertently dent it by squeezing it: it is malleable. The filament falls apart, away from the rest of the inside of the bulb. The midget is watching us from his motorbike outside the window. I tell the others that I've broken the large bulb by squeezing it, and I feel stupid for this. They tell me that a hair-thin thread is still connecting the base of the bulb and the filament, and the bulb is still good if I take a piece of cardboard and form it around the filament to protect the side of the bulb from the heat of the filament. I look and see the hair-thin filament. I realize the cardboard would probably burn up. Two other men arrive in the driveway and are talking to the midget. One man has a briefcase and a load of papers under his arm. He is coming to our door to advertise or sell something about fishing, we think. I tell the others I'll talk to him and tell him politely to go away. He comes to the back door. My sister Ramona and my friend Gretchen Warwick each run to the door, tell him rudely to go away, and then run away from the door. I walk out onto the porch to talk to him and tell him we're not interested in what he has. I invite him into the porch because it's cold outside. I ask if he's selling something. He indicates I should come with him, so I do, wearing socks but no shoes. He wants me to come out to his orange camper-like vehicle that has a high roof in the rear, which is parked in our driveway. He tells me he's been living in his vehicle about a month waiting for me. I'm disturbed by this, and ask him what he wants. He starts to explain to me that my parents entered into a contract with him. In this contract they paid him a good deal of money so that I would be taught about computers; to be married to computers. The money that was paid to him was used to buy a computer, which is now at his house being used for storing his information, documents, and files. At first I don't understand and am disturbed by what he is saying. I ask him questions to clarify, and then I understand. I'm very disgusted and angry. We're standing next to the plum tree in the back yard. I say to the man, \"Go back and sit in your car. If I get confirmation of this (from my mom, who isn't here at the moment, I think) I'll come out, apologize for being harsh, shake your hand, and we'll talk. If I find out there is no bond, I'll come out, shake your hand, and ask you to leave.\" I think of my choice of words: I'm deliberately polite and concise. I'm very loud, firm, assertive, and aggressive. The man is shorter than I, and he is balding. He's a businessman. I bump him as we talk. As I leave, he says to me, \"Your checks are good. You're pushing me around like a Swan Ball.\" He means that I'm strong, firm, decisive, and assertive. Before I go inside I get up close to him and say loudly and threateningly, \"A contract is only legal if both persons are not coerced into signing it.\" I head for the back door. There is a group with the man now. I deliberately bump into one of the group, to tell him to leave. I'm in a very belligerent and disgusted mood. I go inside feeling flustered."

I let out a yell, as I sometimes do in the morning to get going. I get out of bed and put my red John Henry underwear, with a crumpled elastic band, on my shelf. I wrap a towel around myself and walk downstairs. The two monks who teach my Buddhism class, Dhar Thack and Jonah Daruwalla, are at the bottom of the stairs with another monk. Dhar says to me, \"For example, we do not raise the voice: yell.\" I realize that I'm disturbing their sleep, and I say, \"I'm sorry.\" My brother Wally walks by.  I'm in a castle where there is a festival occurring with people selling things. I'm near a stand where a man is making and selling black t-shirts with words written on them in a chalk-like substance. He writes \"1st Sold\" on some of the shirts. My old girlfriend Darla Robertson and several other women walk by. They're all wearing bright orange shorts. Darla asks me if I'm logging again this summer, as a job. I say no.  I'm in a class on Buddhism taught by the two monks. Then a woman is teaching the class in the castle-like setting. A woman next to me asks questions about the lecture material. I tell her it's all in the reading. I know that kids have taken over the castle for 50 years. I'm sitting at a picnic table, which is one of several tables in a group. Something is happening, maybe the class. My dad and Lisa burst through the door. My dad is loud, laughing, and is carrying my friend Reed Maxwell's tent, which he gives to a man thinking he is returning it. My dad is fairly out of control: laughing and talking. He says someone in the room must have the farts. At a table that is turned 90 degrees from the one I was sitting at first, I sit with a group of people and play poker. I have four 7's in my hand. I bet \"four-of-a-kind\", which is a very strong bet! There are several cards in the middle of the table face up. Of these cards, two or three are 7's. I have two or three 7's in my hand, and the ace of hearts, so I have five 7's in all."

I, the black man, am called Hanson. At times I see this man, and at other times I feel his motion and move as him. I ask the man in front of him (I), who is Hanson, for weapons, because he (I) has (have) none. The man sitting in the seat next to me gives me a grenade launcher with a red laser bead scope and an automatic machine gun that looks like a rifle and has two triggers, about eight inches apart, on the stock. We ride. I drop one of my guns on the floor: it's a bumpy ride. I pick it up and am then more careful with the guns, putting the safety buttons on. We approach a man on our left. He is in a tree with a clay target thrower. He has five bright orange clay targets lined up, one by one, in the thrower. This seems to be the usual: we never do anything about it. But he usually only has one or two targets lined up, not five. This time when we pass a white man sitting a few seats in front of me stands up with an automatic rifle to shoot the targets. He waits until the trajectory of the targets is perpendicular to the length of the bus. At this time, the man in the tree flings five targets at once, and the soldier demolishes the line of targets with his rifle. Immediately we see the man throwing the targets is no longer there: he must be wounded, shit! We stop the bus and look around the area without getting off the bus. We can't see him or his body. This must be some kind of trick, and the man is our enemy. We are a hard-core military unit. We are in dense bush country. A woman is with us driving a small bulldozer. She clears the way for our bus to make the necessary turns. She clears a path through the jungle for our powerful, specially designed bus. We continue on. I'm riding in the bucket of a large yellow bulldozer that seems to be what the unit is then riding in. The bucket is raised high up and tilted so I can sit in it and not be seen. I may be able to help the unit as a spy by keeping a low profile here while the main unit rides below. I have the grenade launcher with me, and a gun below with the group. I accidentally drop the grenade launcher. I want to ask the others to hand me my other gun, but then I would expose my hiding spot. I pull two bananas out from the outside of the bucket, behind me. We approach a more elevated area with a trough-like waterslide in the ground that is slippery and muddy. We may be going by plane now as we approach this land. I use hand motions to direct the position of the vehicle to drop me. I indicate to slow down and get closer to the ground. I land, and am dropped off. I will try to rescue my unit from the spy type person that is a threat to us: he may be an assassin. I slide down the water slide, which turns to metal. It is very curvy, with overhangs in some places where people have hit their heads and seriously injured themselves. This slide may be named \"Spiral\". I slide on a banana, which makes me go faster. I know that I'm not the first person to experience the slide. I also know not very many people have experienced this. As I approach the bottom of the slide I seem to know or be told by a narrator that there will be water. I slide in slowly, trying to slow down so I don't get really wet, into a few inches of water. I'm in a laboratory-like area. There is a coffee lounge and several televisions. A teacher is there. It is an academic/research setting. Hanson says, \"What the hell is going on here?\", because he is expecting to find something more covert and militant. The teacher there has no idea what Hanson is talking about, and goes about his business with a cup of coffee or a snack. On one of the televisions an announcer says that \"Hanson has brought the Lions to only three Super Bowls.\""

Wally has not kept the rope that is holding me tight. I'm okay. Wally has big puffy green mittens for climbing. Doug let me use his chalk for my sweaty hands. My grade school classmate Kari Otis is there at some point, and says something to Wally or I. Wally has nibs or bullets, which are chicken, and french fries, which are dehydrated."

We look at them and try to discern if they are Japanese. I think of shooting them from a long way off using a rifle with a scope. Inside a residence there is an insane man who talks nonsense. He has several attendants looking after him. He explains his statements, three or four of which seem contradictory. I use large orange or yellow garbage bags to \"parachute\" my way down stairs as I walk. The man, who is a convict, is locked in. Another woman and I lock the basement doors to keep him inside, and then we run upstairs, inside. I kick or slam a door very hard. Something about the convict is frightening. There is a plane outside with two ski-like apparatus' on the bottom, curved upwards. It takes off near the house and spins in circles as it flies close to the ground. It is a very maneuverable plane. It lands and takes off again, going through a wooded area over a tin shed. I hear the engines pick up as it does this. I'm at home in Oak Valley near my neighbors the Stein's driveway looking into a window in our home, which seems to be where our driveway is. I'm with another person. We spy in the dark. I have a shotgun. My uncle Dannie Redding and others inside see us. Dannie indicates this by pointing three of his fingers, since I'm with two people. The three of us split up and run. I go into the old garage door, just while Dannie, who is like my uncle Brian Vincent but is a different relative, comes out. We greet each other, though I was trying to avoid him, to spy. He picks up four wooden stakes and asks me for an onion. I look around, and after unloading the six bullets in my shotgun, point him in the direction of some homegrown onions. I go inside. My aunt Sherry Redding is there. I ask my brother Wally and my mom, who are cooking chicken for dinner, what time dinner will be ready. My mom says it will be done at 5:00 if they started at 4:30, which they did. The chicken is sliced and breaded."

A security guard is near the gymnasium door, and the door to the outside. He's dressed in a blue police uniform with a funky, feathered hat, and has small, official writing on his uniform.

They are a darker shade, and have a chunk of chocolate or marshmallow on top. He has four of these brownies left. I ask him for one, entreating him half sarcastically and have seriously to let me have one. He seems to intend to eat all four himself. A strange drunk man approaches us from my right. He wants a brownie. We say that the brownies are not good for him, because he doesn't know they have marijuana in. He is persistent and asks why, in his drunkenness.

I pick him up by his face with both of my hands, as my fingers grip his skull and the inside of his mouth. He drools and spits a lot. I get saliva on me. I carry him outside. He is really intoxicated. I throw him out, despite his persistence. It's a long struggle. He takes quite a beating, but he stays out. I scoop up a couple handfuls of slushy snow off the steps and rub it on my face to wash off his saliva. I walk back inside to a group of people who know I've just thrown this man out. My acquaintance Nicolas, another man, and two friends that I know from Norway whom are wearing large puffy bright yellow jackets are there. Kevin and Stephen cheer me for kicking the stranger out and beating him up. My friend Ellen Sanders is there. I give her a big friendly joking shove."

There is a toilet or two that are in the open, in the middle of a room. My aunt Sharon Redding urinates here, sitting down on the toilet with her pants barely pulled down enough to urinate and her knees and legs together. I play a video-like game on a computer. I have to put in my username and password on a computer. My password shows up as a black fish, and I have to try a couple times to get it right. Grandpa Redding does this a lot, and says to me that he has not gotten as for on it as I have, or has never done that. People leave in cars. I lag behind, until the last two cars are going. I may go in a car with my brother Wally, my cousin Archie Weber, and uncle Brian Vincent. I feel cool with them because they've always been the jokers, the mischievous bunch at the family gatherings. People are going to church. We arrive at the place for church. It's a park-like area with scattered trees and small covered shelters. Smoke rises from different area, engulfing the gathering places. There is one main pavilion-like plaza where a crowd is. I know this mass is a polka mass. I comment to my mom on how this one or this time things are more spread out. I approach the mass and see that the Brimson College African Music Ensemble is singing and dancing. Their performance slowly draws to a close. I see my friend Ellen Sanders in the crowd, from a distance. She sees me, and smiles or does a little wave. We have not seen each other in such a long time, and are happy to see each other. The crowd begins to disperse. Ellen comes over to me and we share a big hug. She kisses me on the lips and the right cheek. I kiss her forehead. We exchange a few words, a long time waiting, and she begins to walk away. It's kind of a romantic encounter. She may have said something about marriage, and then left abruptly, leaving me wondering. I want to talk with her! I'm in a group with my mom and several young Arabian men. We're sitting in the pavilion on the ground. We talk about my acquaintance Toly.

Out of the left corner of my peripheral vision I catch a glimpse of a figure that has ducked into a room though an open doorway. I double back and go into the room. The person is hiding there. The person is a woman-like man or a man-like woman: androgynous. This person is wearing a hat over short, shaved hair. The person is then a woman, and explains her story of sex: How she seduced a young man to have sex with her ten times, and then moved on. It seems that she and the young man are the same person.

I'm tagged. I crawl on the floor, giving people a slow count to ten to run away. A short Asian woman is there. She has chin length curly thick dark hair and is wearing lipstick. She is in distress. There is another taller woman there. The two women are standing in a room about 30 feet apart facing each other. The Asian woman is troubled because she is a woman: because she \"has a vagina\", she tells other women. The taller woman says, \"I have a vagina too...\" but there is an adjective the taller woman uses to describe her vagina that is different from the first woman. This adjective may be 'moister' or 'thinner', both meaning more sexually alluring. My classmate Theresa Jamison jokes that I'm a murderer of two people. The area is dark and seems stage-like. The Asian woman, who I think has been wearing a silver dress, is sleeping on the floor. I have a sword. I kill the woman by cutting the floor around her. The floor is a wooden grate-like vent. I cut the pieces of wood in between the holes of the vent. I kill this woman because her father would kill himself if he found out that she is a woman. She is dressed like a man. Blood from her heart drips onto the floor. Theresa jokes that I'm a killer, and will stab her in her sleep, and she will be too scared to scream. I approach Theresa, who is sleeping on a small blue loveseat. She is covered in blue blankets. I have the sword. I cut her several times, shallowly: about one inch deep. I have trouble manipulating the sword to make deep cuts. She awakens and realizes what she said is true: I'm stabbing her and she is too scared to scream. I inflict deeper wounds, stabbing her in the chest, killing her. Blood spurts on the knife I then have, and on the floor. The knife is 12-18 inches long, but isn't a sword. I move her body so it's back on the couch, fully in the sleeping position under the blankets. I think of concealing the body more by sliding it into the sizeable gap between the back of the couch and the couch cushions, but I don't. I know people will find the bodies in a few days and I want this. I don't want to hide the bodies. I'm conscious of my actions. I notice that a Michael Jackson CD is playing at a barely audible level from a CD player in the corner of the room. I need to shuffle the CD or stop it before I continue on. I walk into the kitchen at the Redding farm. It is dimly lit. It's very early morning. I'm wearing sunglasses. I take them off and can see a bit better then. There are several cats walking on the floor. I put the knife in the sink near the washer and dryer. The music is still playing very softly. I'm a murderer of two, as Theresa joked."

Later, I know he is with woman number 279, which is now number 320. I walk over to them in a friendly manner. They're dressed nicely. The cute brown-haired woman is wearing a short skirt with a matching top and heeled open-faced shoes, all of which seem to be tan/orangish-brown. I notice she has braces. I don't mind this. She's very attractive. The four of us start to walk. I hold the cute woman's hand, then put my arm around her. She's very receptive, and holds my hand and puts her arm around me. I'm surprised at the ease with which we hit it off. She's obviously attracted to me, as I am to her. It's odd walking with my arm around her: not the most comfortable way to walk. But it's all right, and we continue. We're walking in snow then, going north on the west side of Home Avenue in Oak Valley, past my neighbors the Trammell's house. I see the brown station wagon in our driveway and know my mom is home. We get closer to our front steps. There is about three inches of fresh powder snow. I'm barefoot. I open the rear passenger side door of the station wagon, which is parked on Home Avenue facing south on the west side of the road. I climb in and grab my red and gray wool socks for my feet. We're all going to walk to a movie theatre. I ask the girls if they want me to grab them a pair of socks, since they're wearing none. They say no. We walk to the movie. I talk with Stephen about deer hunting. We're in a building about to walk south towards Jose Ramos' deer stand at the Ramos' property. The speed of a bullet must be programmed into a small electronic device on the wall before we start walking. Both of the women have cigarettes: they smoke. This doesn't seem too aversive to me: it seems to be something I could tolerate. I'm a bit past the building out in a pasture with cows. I have two lit cigarettes in my hands. I blow through them, not breathing in any of the smoke. I don't really want to smoke them, but they're not as aversive as I would expect them to be. My acquaintance Gordie is there, smoking. We walk to Jose's deer stand, then back along through the trees and forest. I'm watching a movie of a gunfight in which two men turn and face each other, about to fire. I've seen this movie before. One of the men is shot, but not by his opponent, but by another, miniature, man. He is shot several times. One man is shot in the eye, leaving a large hole there, like in the movie Terminator 2. The cute woman comes over and sits next to me. She is warm. I see a red scar on her belly. I'm happy to be with her: It's been a long time since I've had a sexual encounter. I talk giddily, nonsense. I want to say something because I feel good to be with her. I act goofy and say I'm always cold. We kiss. Immediately I can tell she is a good kisser. I try to kiss well. She sticks her tongue very far inside my mouth. I gag, and feel paralyzed, like I can't open or close my mouth. Her tongue is then her finger. I bite her finger, in what seems like a natural reaction because I couldn't breathe or move. I cut her finger with my teeth, I see, when she pulls it out of my mouth. It is a wide, deep, long cut on the side of her knuckle. I didn't mean to bite her."

Mike Hollow and Phoebe Mills are gone to town for the day. The sheds are locked up so I can't get the woman what she needs. It's later, Mike and Phoebe arrive back. Mike says that after their baby went to bed at 9am they got some rest. We may be the woman her tool. I'm down on the dock with my friends Jerry Parsons and Tom Olson. It's an overcast, chilly day. Jerry looks cold. I ask him if he wants a shirt. He says yes. I then realize I don't have any extra shirts, and I tell him I'll give him mine when I get done with work. There is a 44-foot whit boat, which Tom, and then Jerry, get in. There is a smaller 12-foot boat with a motor. Mike pulls the smaller boat up on the left side of the dock. He runs the motor to get the fishing line out of it. The motor spits out a long thin strand of line. When it's done, I pick the line up. The curling, slinky-like strand of line is apple peel. There is a stereo on the dock, tilted. I sit and look at tapes there: Led Zeppelin and others."

Patrick is hitting hard line drives. A few vehicles circle around and stop near the park. They are city vehicles: the men have come to tell us not to play on the field. I ask one of them men to see his bill showing the amendment that says we can't play here. He pulls out a sheet with his photograph and a bunch of signatures on it. I ask when it was passed, to see if it is in effect. He says it was passed on fifth. He then says, \"In nine and a half minutes you should all go over to Chickenfeed, if you know what I'm saying.\" I understand him to mean that we have ten minutes to leave, of which a half-minute has already elapsed. Also, by going to Chickenfeed, which is a building near the Hill Lodge, we may play at a different place: it will allow us to keep playing. I think of Sundial Park and the Little League Park, trying to figure out what he could mean for a place to play. I don't understand where we could, but he's implying there's a way we can get around the law and play. A person arrives on a tall old white 10-speed bicycle. Another man arrives in a big white 4x4 truck. The two people are my classmates Bud Slick and Kory Reynolds. My classmates Mike Brimms and Jesse Dockens arrive. I tell them meekly that we can't play.

When the police officers arrive I walk up to talk to them first, since I was an eyewitness. I tell them what happened, and about the gangs fighting. I surreptitiously put the blame on one of the gangs, the gang which wasn't at my house, to exonerate myself from guilt. The police seem to think that searching for the gang is futile.

I open the inside garage door and they run out under the big old yellow swinging garage door. At some point I'm calling them back in. It takes a while for them to come in, but eventually they do. It is winter: cold with crusty dry snow. My mom is gone at the moment. I see my friends Annie Thomas, Nate Nelling, Emily Zates, and another person. They walk down Home Avenue going south, as I look out the front window. I don't want to run after them directly, but I do want to see them, so I plan to run down the alley and intercept them nonchalantly, so it will look like an accident. I put on shoes that are too small for me, and are very tight on my feet, with tight laces. I'm wearing my green wool sweater and I put on my fuzzy green coat. I go out the back door and grab an old cracked and broken red/orange plastic shovel. I do this so it will look like I'm going to do something. My mom pulls in the driveway as I'm about to walk down the alley. She is driving the brown station wagon. I get near the end of the alley and come across a boy whose bicycle is in disrepair.

I take the front wheel and fork apart from the frame and see there are three bolts holding it together, going into the fork. Annie, Nate, and Emily walk up to me as I'm helping the boy. One of them comments, \"I should've known that he'd be here...\" I help the boy, starting to screw in three bolts. Nate says, \"So, how was it?\" He means my study abroad in Australia, from which it seems I have now returned. \"It sucked\", I say facetiously, and then crack a smile. I continue, as the others laugh at my sarcasm, \"I'm going to India.\" The others catch a glimpse of my captivation by my experiences. Annie is lying on her back to the right of me. She laughs.

The game is a non-conference game involving two teams that aren't so good, instead of facing tough non-conference opponents like Powerton. I'm standing on a different part of the sidelines on what may be a different court. One team has several really big players. There are two or three slam-dunks, one by a really tall man and another by a shorter but stronger man. It's a fast-paced game. At halftime my friend Nat Miller leaves. I head out to his car with him. My friend Matt Yams has gotten in the game. I cheer for him. He has short hair. Nat and I agree to play basketball at 10:30am tomorrow morning with my acquaintance Kevin Valley and maybe others. I go back inside. I feel like I'm the center of attention when I walk in. The team is wearing red warm up jerseys. Coach Shooter Jackson is wearing one over his suit."

I say, \"G'day mate, 'the native'?\" This is a greeting and inquiry. He understands me and replies, speaking English. Other aborigines come forth. We're camping. Four or five of the men are white, and my age. They have joined the group. I wonder about their background and homes, but I don't think it's right to ask them about it because that would degrade their status as aborigines. One of the young men talks of a septic tank, and others comment on holes for fecal disposal. Another man talks about Chai tea. When he asks, I say there is tea where I come from. There is a large fire; it is dark out. There are several large pieces of wood in the fire, and the coals are red hot. I add more wood on top of these. I dump water out near the sleeping area, and then realize I should have dumped it away from camp. I dumped some on my sleeping mat.

I wait, trying to be patient and pleasant, saying nothing. The lunch lady then serves me a rectangular slice of greasy pizza, with crumbled beef in it. I also get a slice of white bread. I take my yellow tray to the line. I stop to take a blue carton of skim milk from the large white cooler. As I do this I see my grade school classmate Tim Nimen. He is tall, with longer, brown straight hair. He says, \"Hey!...\" I say, \"Hi Tim\", in a very reserved manner, and continue on. My lunch is rather small, I think, but I'll eat it. I walk out to the cashier. There is some chaos near the cashier: several people are there just standing around. The cashier is attending to something else. I stand there a bit. Since there's no one to pay, I think of punching my own lunch ticket. I don't have a token. I turn and face the commons to go eat. Immediately many people surround me, talking to me, and shouting out. They make a big deal that I'm back. I recognize many faces: My grade school classmate Sonya Nittles, a guy named Brice or Brady, and many others. I sit down and others join me. Sonya is on my left. She comments on something to do with her breasts: how she will never do that again, implying changing her breasts. While she says this she lightly pounds her chest, one breast with each fist. I understand her to be saying that she's content with small breasts. She takes the middle of my piece of bread sneakily. When I see this I quickly eat the rest of my lunch, because it's small. I wiggle my front lower right tooth. I think I should drink a few more cartons of chocolate milk, for the calcium. The milk I had with my lunch was chocolate, though it was skim when I took it."

A shot of lemon-ish liquid is put on the table and one has to suck or lick t off the table and then chase it with a lemon-flavored chaser in a glass with a straw. The man arrives and joins us. The biggest problem, I find, is not doing the shot itself, but having enough wind power to suck it all up off the table. My high school friend Nelson Eastman comes up: he is a waiter and is clearing the table. I'm with a man whom I'm friends with from high school; we both know Nelson and ask for free drinks. Nelson says he could probably help us, and asks how much we want to drink. I say as much as possible. When I say this I notice Nelson's boss has walked up behind him! Our attempt to get free drinks may be foiled. Nelson rolls his eyes as he walks away from his boss. We still may get free drinks if his boss didn't catch the gist of the conversation. I get up and walk around. The pub has quickly become crowded. The people I was sitting with have moved or left and others have taken over the table. I see my high school classmates Donald Dilson and Nathan Plumber. I walk around. A woman walks past me from behind and taps her fingers on my back as she does, indicating she doesn't like it when people do that to her: she thinks I walked past her and tapped her on the back a moment before. In fact, I didn't. It must have been a different man clandestinely hitting on her. I see a blondish woman at a table. I think I hear my name, but when I look she doesn't notice me. She looks a bit like my friend Sarah Reed or Helen Vader. I see my high school teammate Shawn Salzburg and his brother Brent, standing together next to a wall. I go talk to them. Both have long, stringy goatees, like mine, but about four to six inches long. Brent's is especially long. My teammate's father Greg Kulik is there with us. He is standing close, facing me. I jokingly pretend to knee him in the groin. After, I think that isn't the kind of personality I want to be displaying. I talk with the Salzburgs about basketball. Shawn says he's playing for the local youth hostel association. Brent's girlfriend yells at him because he's drinking and has a heart murmur: he could die. He says he's not on the drugs anymore, so he can drink. He is close to me, and I get specks of saliva in my face as he talks. I tell Shawn that my basketball playing days are over.

            "content": "A Renewed Armstrong  I'm on 2nd Street in Wilmerton between Large Company and Box Company going west. I'm riding a bicycle. My friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos are with me. There is a man on the median waiting for something. He seems to be a teacher from Armstrong High School. I ride and turn right at the intersection of School Avenue. I see a sheriff's car down on the bank of the Armstrong pond. It's rear tires are in the water. There is one officer in the car and another standing up near the road next to a tree. They are trying to catch students who are speeding on their way to school. The sheriff near the road has a radar gun. The car is parked on the bank, low in the water so people won't see it. I ride by on the grass, thinking I'm doing nothing that can get me in trouble. As I get closer to the school the officers stop a speeding vehicle. It is my friend Bubba Hacker on his motorcycle, I see. I arrive at Armstrong and look for my locker. School is about to begin. I feel that this place is very familiar: I am used to it and am comfortable here. I see my friends Mya Rousing and Sarah Reed. They come up and ask me questions about something I have said in the past. I don't to focus on that, or deal with it. I reply tersely that I just call 'em like I see 'em. I can't find my locker. The lockers are a different style and have a different kind of lock on them. They are made up of small drawers. I ask my friend Virginia Green where are lockers are, and she points them out to me. I find a bra and panties in the top drawer of my locker, and as I open the other drawers I see more items, as if the locker is still being used. I see the name \"Julie Newman\" on a notebook in one of the drawers. I know this must have been her old locker. In case she is still using it I set my stuff on the side. [Interesting day residue note in journal.] I walk down towards homeroom. There are many people in the hallway; many teachers. The atmosphere is lively. I know it's the first day of school. I walk through the crowd, recognizing a few teachers. One of my teachers says to me, \"Feels good to be a senior, huh?\" He is a good teacher: a friend. I see Bubba wearing his football jersey and joke with him about his speeding ticket. I walk to the commons area, which has been remodeled. The structure of the building is different. It is essentially a new building. The ceiling of the commons is high, and there is an a la carte lunch line on my left side. It seems to be much classier than the old lunch line. I see my old teammates Nate Nelling, Tony Kramer, and other basketball players. I go up to them in a friendly manner and say hi. They are terse and say hi back unenthusiastically. They are not excited to see me, and I think would probably prefer to not see me because they think I'm strange and am on the wrong track in life. Tony, in particular, thinks this. There is a large cream-colored phone on the table. I pick it up. It is 14-15 inches long. It has earpiece holes, but no mouthpiece to speak into. I say \"Hello, with whom am I speaking?\" I see Bubba on another phone, and know it's him I'm joking around talking to. A woman's voice is on the phone. She says, \"Kenneth?\" I recognize the voice as my acquaintance Eve Nichols. She is working as some sort of a telephone operator. Tony seems to be embarrassed of my joking antics and silliness on the phone."

This is moose territory. We arrive at the huge dead tree we have been walking towards. It's dead but has leaves. It's hundreds of meters tall, at least 40 feet in diameter, and it shoots straight upward: a massive, cylindrical trunk! There are no leaves or branches below about 100 meters, like a eucalypt. I stand at the base of the tree and look up: the tree is immense: absolutely huge! Others in the group and I want to set up some kind of structure or habitat in this huge tree trunk. I see a notch cut around the tree, about a foot deep: just a scratch in a tree this big. We try to figure out how we can get up to the point high up on the trunk to begin our work. It is 90 meters to the base of the foliage. We only have 70 meters of rope. I see the dining room at home, and the metal hooks attached to the wooden ladder-like plant holder. I think if we can tie the rope between the hooks, or from hooks to stretch across the open space, then we'll be able to grapple our way out to the tree, like a tightrope. I see the immense tree bend and sway with the wind. The trunk cracks and falls. Huge triangular chunks of wood pour down like rain. They are about 10 feet tall and just as wide, and weigh tons. I take cover. They are parts of the tree. Two of our group members are at the base of the tree when these fall. I fear that they will be crushed by the immense chunks of wood, and I frantically look for them. The wood chunks are still unstable, and could roll over or shirt, easily crushing a human. I don't find the bodies of the two. I'm in the basement at home in Oak Valley. Fifty-gallon drum-shaped rock boulders drop from above me, all around. I am scared of being crushed and may take a way out, through the pit room. I think this may be a chain reaction: from falling tree chunks to boulders. In the basement I though the danger was gone, but it continued, and rocks fell near the base of the steps."

There is a wharf on one side of us, and a reddish building on the other side where the picture of the ship is. I walk into a casino with other people.

I'm surprised to get paid eight-to-one for the full house. Geoff draws a few cards. I see the draws three 4's, and that he has a four in his hand, for four 4's, which beats me! I'm a bit confused, because this has been divided into two hands, and though he has four 4's, I'm still going to get paid for my full house, because they occur on different hands."

It is like a balloon that is stretched out but wrinkly and deflated. There is much loose, plastic-like skin and my penis is thin and rubbery: flaccid like a rolled out piece of play dough. I try to re-establish an erection, to inflate my penis, but it is to no avail."

            "content": "Meeting Person  I'm catching chickens. I wander through several large rooms with corridors between them. There seems to be an underwater feeling to the rooms. I go into a room where two familiar women are peeling shrimp, as a job. They ask me if I want one. I ask them if it's okay, and they say any of us can eat all we want. I think this is like the chocolate factory I visited. I ask if the shrimp are cooked, and the woman says yes. So I peel a shrimp and eat it.  I'm on a plane flying over a city. It's dusk. I look out to my left where the chicken barns would be. The barns are smaller: about the size of a city plot of land for a house, and are close together, connected. There is water, a bay or a river, that the city is built along. I lay down on the left wing of the plane (from the point of view of being in the plane facing forwards). I'm out at the tip of the wing, and I hold on to the edge. We fly over the city. It's dark and the city lights shine beautifully. The plane begins to turn and I feel unstable in my position on the wing. An arm reaches up and touches me on the left side of my head. I'm wearing my green wool hat. I realize that I've been lying down on the person whose arm touched me. I see she is fair skinned and has thick straight shoulder length blond hair. She reminds me a bit of my friend Emily Zates. She doesn't mind that I'm laying on her. She is lying on her stomach too. She indicates for me to hold on as the plane turns, and I do. The plane soars to the right, coming in fast for a landing. It gets close to the ground, and slows, and it seems the plane will be thrust forward and upwards, but it lands, unexpectedly to me. A red station wagon-like car is in place of the front wheels of the plane. There are several inches of fresh snow on the runway. The woman and I are low to the ground and let go of the plane when we can do so safely: without being in danger of being hit or run over by the plane. I feel peaceful, happy, adventurous, and free. An old couple is then driving the car that was the landing gear. The woman introduces herself as \"Person\". I think this may be spelled Pearson or Person, but is pronounced like the noun 'person'. I introduce myself as \"Kenneth\". I'm very happy to meet her. She is a very attractive person in many ways. We walk where the snow is deeper to get back to the airport terminal from the runway. She has bare feet. I'm wearing sandals with no socks. My feet are warm. A white car drives along side of us. Three young men in it ridicule us for no apparent reason. Person runs up to the car and hops in the sliding door on its left side. I follow and jump on. This surprises the guys inside. One of them says his name is Gabe. He tells me he's going to the airport to pick up (my friend) Gretchen Warwick. I tell him matter-of-factly that I know Gretchen: we were on a study-abroad program together. I introduce myself to him. The airport is a large open area. We wait. Some of the guys ask about my green hat. I tell them it's wool, and it's warm. Gabe asks me to drive my acquaintance Bill Vanderbil home because Bill and Gretchen don't get along in the car. I'm nervous about driving, but then he just asks me to hold the keys, which is fine with me. My friend Jennifer Valentine is there. She talks to me, saying, \"I can't believe you laid on her and didn't know she was there!...\" I see Person , who is with the woman that came to the airport to get her. She is standing a few hundred feet away from me, about to leave the airport area. We make eye contact and wave at each other: there is a mutual attraction to each other, not necessarily physical, though that may be present. I'm attracted to her person: who she is. Though she is far away, I hear her voice. She is describing what I look like so that she can point me out to the person I am with. I'm wearing my baggy 8th grade Union Bay jeans and the green wool hat. I have on my turquoise chamois cotton shirt with some shirts underneath it. I unbutton my turquoise shirt so person has some description of me to relate to her friend. As I do this I hear her saying, \"He's unbuttoning his shirt...\", identifying me."

I tell her this is how unpeaceful it is here: harsh language, conflict, hatred, anger, which all occurs in silence. I walk out the porch door. To my left I see Seaside Hill. The base is visible but the peak is in clouds. I realize I'm dreaming because Seaside Hill is not near the Redding farm. I fly around the farmyard, slowly and low to the ground. I see the black and white cat that roamed the neighborhood of my flat in Coverton, and often visited the flat. I land and call the cat over to me. It doesn't come at first. I try to use my will power to make it come over to me. It comes closer, and is about ten feet away. I don't force it to come any closer: I try to respect the cat's wishes. I sit there a while with the cat nearby. I think about the cat: what it's doing, what, and who it is. I tell the cat that I'll see it again."

I know I'm guilty of this. I think it was my rustiness that made me commit the foul. I should have just realized I couldn't get away with it, and should have taken the foul and got the free throws. I am replaced in the game. Somehow, I get a shot, a lay-up that is an ally-oop, and is very out of control. It misses narrowly. Then I'm replaced. I walk off the court. I grab a tray of ground beer like one would buy at the grocery store, and dump it over the head of the other coach. I realize I'm in a dream. I fly, low to the court.

We walk around the ridge, looking up on the ridge to see approximately where the cave is. I'm with my friend Reed Maxwell. We're in a fairly flat, gravely area with a stream running through it. My friend Sarah Reed and her friend ride up on bicycles. We stand around in this flat area. It's a bright sunny day. I'm wearing my green wool hat with a white t-shirt tucked in the hat, falling down over the back of my neck and shoulders. I'm wearing cheap large black sunglasses that block out all the sun. I have a camera that I hold out in front of me, pointing it at myself to take a photograph. Sarah is behind me and will be in the photograph. When I'm about to take it she pushes me forward. I lunge forward while trying to take the photograph. We're about to walk up towards the cave. I see my classmate Melvin Dahlheimer and one of his friends riding on bicycles up towards the cave. They get off their bicycles because it's too rough and steep to ride, and they carry them up. We get over to the base of the ridge. Sarah says we have to go past ten poles. There are steps leading up and around the ridge with poles marking the side of the track. The steps are wide, wooden, and completely enclosed. We get a bit up on the track and there is a view of Mud Mountain with Oak and Maple trees in the foreground. Their leaves are changing color and the green grass is neatly mowed. I take a photograph. The landscape is cartoon-esquely surreal. At the top of the stairs is a shop/tourist place that is mostly empty. It's made of stained and varnished hardwood. There is a cafeteria-like area. My roommate Glen Ryan uses the toilet there. I think he must be defecating because in the bush that is the only time one uses the toilet."

I also beheaded Persia's body, which is under my bead. I talk to some people. They talk about where Annie is: where she will turn up, because she is missing. I go along with their talk, saying I don't know, but knowing full well that I've killed her. I get off the bus and walk towards a house where I live, which I don't recognize. It seems to be kind of a dump: maybe a trailer home. As I walk towards it I realize I've done something terrible for which there is no remedy. I'm guilty of a heinous crime. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt, despair, and hopelessness. Even if I somehow tried to rid myself of Persia's body, the fact that there is no head would reveal my guilt. I realize that one bad action ruins all the good actions I've done. I don't know what to do. I know someone will find out what I've done. I walk into the house and someone I know or live with tells me there is an animal or something scary in my room. I go in my room. Loudly, I scare a small colorful snake out from under my bed. I'm afraid of it, thinking it is poisonous. I pick it up, grabbing it behind the head, so it won't bite me. It is on the floor. I stomp on it repeatedly to kill it."

I have to answer ten short answer questions and one of three essay questions. For the essay question there are five cards. I get the ace of spades, and a 10, 4, 5, and 8 of different suits.

I take breaks from the exam to get refreshments even though I'm doing poorly and am pressed for time. I discover that my classmate Kevin Valley has torn up my exam paper!

I'm then cooking and eating broccoli with spaghetti sauce. We continue to talk. I joke that I try to keep a three to five day schedule in keeping in contact with her, while she seems to keep a five to seven day schedule in keeping touch with me.

My next move would then be to confront the older women about fellatio and their denture-less mouths, or to go wherever this sexual act is occurring. Something happens with my flipping over two empty glasses, upside down. They're like the glasses Rob McDyss has given me to pour my beer into. I'm in a house where people have sex for money. It's more respectable than prostitution, which it is not. One can have sex anywhere on the body, within limits. People are employed to have sex and to allow others to have sex with them. I have sex with a large man. He is big and strong: hefty. He has dark skin and hair, like a traditional Maori. I think he's from the pacific islands. I don't know how it begins. I find him kneeling or bending over in front of me. My erection fumbles around, and then penetrates his anus, which feels tight and pleasurable. While we're having sex I ask what the instructions for orgasm are. They are: one is to stand up when they are about to orgasm and put their hands in the air (like they are being held up!). I do this, but not when I'm about to ejaculate: it's a trial experience for me. I leave before ejaculation. The man says something about the position of my hands above or below something, and how that alters the procedure for orgasm. When I stand up I'm naked, but am wearing my navy green t-shirt. I leave feeling guilty that I used these people because I didn't orgasm: I wasted their time. I walk into a kitchen where my friends Kevin Simpson and Stephen Ramos are. They're both naked, wearing towels around their waists. Both have erections. I walk up to them in my shirt, with an erection. This is a type of camaraderie: male bonding.

I am on the verge of lucidity, and I try not to wake up; I try to maintain my lucidity in the dream (the dream within this dream). I test the reality of the situation by biting something and pounding/punching the floor to see if my hand/arm goes through. The floor is hard, and I conclude I'm not dreaming. I try to will my arm to go through the floor, moving it slowly, steadily, and firmly, but I can't pass it through the floor. I then awaken and find myself with the two men, who are laughing at me. I've been biting onto the toe of one of their shoes and pounding the floor with my fist. I think that those actions are incompatible with the atonia of REM, but I think that my body twitches in REM somehow caused this action or was the action.

I don't dial it properly: don't turn the correct number of turns, and can't open the box. I try several times, with no success. A man next to me gets his mail by reaching through an opening behind the mailboxes and pulling out his mail from the opening in the back. I manage to get my box open slightly and slip my mail out. I have a big stack of mail: about ten letters. Some are business, some personal. I see a letter that looks like it has my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas' handwriting on the envelope, but I don't think it's from her, rather, from another woman with similar handwriting. I walk back from the post office down the hallway. There are stairs in the hallway, and people are stopping and sitting down all around the steps to read their mail."

I'm nervous and uncomfortable about staying here because I've never been comfortable in this room: it gives me the creeps. There are two beds: one in the far left corner low to the ground, and another closer to the door and higher off the ground. I feel claustrophobic and contaminated. I see that there is another bed up against the other wall close to the door. It appears someone is sleeping there. This makes me glad, because now I don't have to worry about being stuck in the small bed in the corner low to the ground with someone sleeping on the bed next to me higher up. I think Vev is the person staying in the room. I'm with my mom and my sister Ramona at a campground. We drive to a place away from occupied campsites. It's nearly dark. There is a lot of gear at the site: some huge fluffy sleeping bags and more. I think of staying the night here instead of where I would stay."

One of the characters is not strong enough to mentally perform a task. A red dot appears, as a mental image of an immense air ship begins to tilt, fall, and crash.

When we get to the top Kevin goes up to the edge and jumps off without hesitation. I look out through the small door-like opening where he jumped. There is a river hundreds of feet below us. There is a train bridge crossing the river below us. Kevin free falls for about six seconds while the wind blows him over the train bridge below us, down river. I watch as he falls and am afraid he'll land on the bridge: splat! But he blows over it. He gets close to the water. I see white water below him, and am worried he's going to land in a shallow, rocky area and be killed. He lands, and I see him surface, alive and well. Others also jump. I don't jump because it's too high: I'm very scared of jumping from this height. We're in the river water below. There are many people swimming and floating, playing in the water. I see one body in the water, face down. I think the person is drowning, and pull their head up feeling panicked. The woman turns her head and moves so I know that she's okay. I'm nervous about this whole situation: very high jumping, people swimming about. I think someone may get hurt, and that concerns me. Four men in their late 20's, beer-drinkin', cigarette smokin', cut-off wearin', long stringy-haired guys, jump off the lower train bridge into the water. They joke, are careless, carefree, and silly. Others see his and go to jump."

I've lost track of the numerous airplane flights. I walk down the ramp. Some people go to the left to get luggage. That isn't the correct way to go; I go to the right. There are many luggage carousels. I don't know which will have my luggage on it. Some carousels are labeled with names. I walk to one that I think is correct because I vaguely recognize the people around it as being on the same flight as I. The luggage starts to feed out onto the carousel. I stand on the flat side and wait. A very large piece of cream-colored luggage appears. A young man runs after it and grabs it as it approaches me from my left. It's a very big, heavy bag, and appears to be hard-sided. As he grabs it, its slow but steady momentum makes him lunge forward, jerking his body. He manages to jerk and drag it off the carousel, and I see that it's not hard-sided, but is made of flimsy black cloth. The man starts to swear because there is a cello in the bag, and it was bumped when he removed it from the carousel. The carousel area is in the bush. There are sparse trees and pale green tall grasses around, dry looking scrub brush. I see a cellular phone on the carousel as it goes past me. I go after the phone because I know it's a man's phone: he is there but just missed it. I go to grab it and give it to him. I pick up the phone and am going to toss it to him but I don't: I'll walk it over to him. All the lighting in the area turns off: the area is dark. A dull, dim, but noticeable light is cast around and upon me. I feel on the spot: uneasy having a light shined on me in the dark. I may go to give the phone to its owner. I think I may have hit a button by accident when picking it up. The light on me changes its intensity. I walk with my grade school classmate Patrick Bergman. It's dark. We have some fleeting light at times to view what is in front of us. I see tan-colored mud, bubbling and boiling, giving off steam. We sidestep or trek lightly through this. We arrive at an entrance-like area where several young adults are. My friend Holly Lapson is there with two others, one of whom is a woman I recognize from school. They're at the entrance to act as greeters. We talk a bit. I am uneasy because of my past behavior around them: I've always been fairly antisocial in appearance and demeanor. Holly says there are two groups, one of which is going out tonight to do an activity. She reads the names of three or four people who are in this evening group. Then she tells me I'm with the morning group. She points out several small cabin-like shacks that are our lodgings. I know that this is a camp-like organization where meetings of young adults take place, in groups. I'm then in a crowd of people in the camp. I see many people I know, including my friend Emerald Reinhold, who waves and smiles at me. She's wearing gray with a hint of bright orange on a zipper; it may be fleece. Holly is there. I walk by my high school classmates Daryl and Chris Yeller. One of them walks on each side of me. I say hi. I see my high school classmates Kristy Puffy and Amber Sherman. My friend Jill Banks is there. I think Jill is back from Africa. I see two Jill Banks', who look exactly alike. There is a girl there who seems to be Jill's younger sister. I sit by myself as people walk and talk to each other. The atmosphere is friendly and happy. A younger blond man comes up to me. I vaguely recognize him as a basketball player, which is how he knows me. He says something like, \"Hey Hanson, how's it going?\" I respond lukewarmly, say, \"Okay.\" I talk with Kristy. I'm losing awareness because I've been traveling so long. I ask her where we are because I honestly have no idea. She says we're at the Duck's call, which is the name of the camp. I ask where it is, and she says Blackville. I ask where that is, and she says Rwanda! I recognize the name of Rwanda to be in Africa. I ask if we're in Africa and she says yes. Wow. I can't believe I'm in Africa. This is an orientation outing, to get to know people. I think this is a really long way to have flown for orientation."

I comment on the few days that it's nice to walk around here: it has to be clean, calm, and sunny, in the early morning. I walk with one or more people. I grab a stick that is partially fallen and drag it along for a bit. We near the park and I see that people are setting up for the bazaar. There is a huge army green canvas tarp that is being set up and staked down to be a trampoline. The Blackstone family is helping with the setup. Their little girl is crying. I stop and note her crying. I feel guilty because when I was a child I treated these people badly. I'm down under the park pavilion. Many people are there: familiar faces. I see my high school classmate Mike Brimms, sitting to the north of the shelter, with his baseball team, who are all in uniform. I see my friend Emerald Reinhold. We make eye contact from a distance, but the passing crowd obscures it. I maintain my gaze in her direction, and when the people wander out of our line of sight, we make eye contact again. She smiles and waves, and I do too, giving her two thumbs up. I see our friend Jill Banks is with her. I wave and smile. Then I wander around mindlessly: nonchalantly avoiding them. I want to talk to them, but would prefer them to come to greet me, rather than I greeting them. Jill runs around the crowd over to me and we share a big hug. I pick her up, my arms locking down near her waist or butt. She is very light. We talk a bit. I tell her that last night I had a dream that I saw two of her that were exactly the same! She has a friend with her who is a tall woman with shoulder length straight blond hair. She has a small stud nose ring in her left nostril. She is very attractive, I think. She may be wearing a black blazer and seems to have an orange (the fruit) on her somewhere, or an orange is associated with her. She may have a piece of orange peel stuck to her face somewhere, which then falls off. I stand with them and talk. I'm wearing my maroon Nike shorts and my Redson 9th grade basketball t-shirt. Jill's friend comments on my hairiness; I see she sees my legs. I take this as a compliment: I like my hairiness. But I act standoffish, as if I don't know how to take her comment, saying, \"Uhhhhh, Okay.\" As we talk, my high school crush Harmony Allure and her friend walk by, and catch my eye. They act as though they don't see me, and I don't acknowledge them. The pavilion is going to be used for Bingo. The announcer rhymes haphazardly on the microphone in a comical manner. His words don't quite rhyme, but he manipulates them in a humorous manner. The crowd and I laugh. I see that the announcer is Jake Truck. Jake has a black and gray beard. I'm jealous of the attention and affection that he gets in this role as announcer. I try to dismiss this feeling. There is an announcement for those in back to sit down, so all the people can see and the game can begin. I go and sit on the edge of a large black picnic table. I see my third grade teacher Liza Minikel carrying a baby. As people all crowd in to find a place to sit I slide down to the end of the bench. My friend Nate Nelling is at the other end. He yells at me saying, \"Hanson, don't move down!\" He doesn't want me to give up my space to these latecomers that are now crowding in. I see that Grandpa Redding is sitting in the middle of the bench, a few people down from me."

A few fish nip at the lure. I try, but don't hook any. A large fish swims in front of me, from my right to left. It looks like a huge trout! I dangle the fly in front of it but it doesn't bite. The fish turns and swims past me on my left side. There is a band behind me. The fish swims towards it, there is no water there. I see the fish is then an animal with four legs, each about two feet long. It is wrapped in blue plastic wrap and has a rubber band around part of it. I pick it up by its hind legs. I'm afraid of it biting or scratching me. I swing it, whacking it against a large sink six or nine times. It's now dead. After this incident where I beat the animal to death a sketchy evening news team pursues me because of my behavior. A woman with a microphone hounds me. I don't reply. I go to my truck, get in, lock the passenger door, and drive away. I may have the dead animal with me."

No one with authority is there, so I play it off as if it never happened, like I'm not responsible for the cracks. I use the barbell with two 25-pound plates on it.

She has had breast implants. There are two large, lumpy areas on her breasts that are purple or black in color. I slide my erection between her breasts and tell her to give me fellatio at the same time. She does. I near orgasm, and feel pre-ejaculatory fluid spurt out of my erection. She stops giving me fellatio: she doesn't want a mouthful of semen. I say, \"No! Keep sucking!\", and I start to masturbate to keep up the arousal. She starts to give me fellatio again.

My friend Stephen Ramos gets a fist-sized rock and throws it. It heads directly for the windshield of a car that a man is driving. The rock smashes through the windshield as the bus drives by the car, while the man is stopped at an intersection. The man quickly yells vengeance, records the license plate number of the bus. We hear him talk, recording the information, even though we're in our bus driving away. We're all shocked. I quickly move out of my seat to a different seat not so close to Stephen to seem like I didn't have a part in this event. Stephen assures us all he'll take full responsibility for his actions and put no blame on us."

I go past a cafeteria-like area where I see my high school classmates June Meeker and Tracy Noles. I talk with them even though we didn't talk much in school. My schoolmate Aaron Webbed is there. I'm told the locker room is five blocks down the hall; this school is huge! I pass my grade school classmate Ryan Vaurnet as I go down the hallway. There is a man scrubbing the floor. One person slips on the wet floor. The person is all right; the cleaner stops until we pass. The hallways are smooth, sealed, tan or off white in color: really space age looking. There are large areas on each side of the hall for entertainment or food. There is a place where people shoot footballs like one would a basketball. This school seems to have everything! I make it to the locker room. I see other teams there for the tournament. I know I'm an important player on our team: the other teams recognize who I am."

I try to fire again at a goose that is close, just as it's taking off. It slows and sinks into the water. I happy, I finally shot a goose! It begins to float. I grab its head of black hair and lift it out of the water. It's not a goose, but a boy! He is hit in three or four places with pellets: in the head and upper body, and won't live. I'm horrified! I have shot a person! I try to comfort the dying boy, give him what I can. I caress his limbs and hold him in my arms. I try to keep him warm, hugging him. The boy is wearing shorts. He has about three-inch long black hair and darker skin. I think he's Mexican. People seem to discount the seriousness of what has happened. I'm in shock.

The auditorium, which has been dimly lit, is now bright. My friend Matt Yams is on one side of me. My friend Stephanie Peterson is behind me. A ceremony has ended and a reception is about to occur. I stand up in the front row of the seats. I have gas, which I'm trying to hold in. Stephanie bumps and pokes me. I blurt out a little, but noticeable, fart. She is disgusted, and facetiously says, \"Oh, nice, Kenneth.\" I laugh, feeling embarrassed, but also glad that I let it out. I hold in more farts. Matt talks to me about the color of a particular fishing lure: how to get the reddish color deeper or better, using small cube-shaped blocks of red.  A senior party is occurring. People are given checks for thousands of dollars in fake money. They need to go cash them to get the money. I get a check for $13,000. It's actually worth about $98, which my family as paid for so I can enjoy the senior party. There are long lines to cash checks, so I wait. I'm in line for something. My grade school friends Eric Stoner and Mark Long, who is dead, are there. I think of Mark: is he real? I touch his shoulder: it is firm. I think he is actually there. The next moment he is gone, when I look. I say to Eric, \"Did you see Mark?\" I look on the floor where there is a scratch. I think this scratch is a sign of Mark. I look at it, concentrating, having a moment for him. Eric sees me on my knees, scrutinizing the scratch. He criticizes me. He knows I'm doing this because of Mark. My friend Stephen Ramos comes up to me and says he needs the $5 I owe him. I tell him not now. He repeats himself, saying he wants the $5 now! I reply harshly, \"Not now!\", because I'm busy.

The street in front of the house looks like it's under construction from the tornado damage. The trees in the yard have been bent and broken. The color of the bark of the branches is lighter. The house seems flimsy. The upstairs floor is thin and unstable. Much power is lost, only a few lights and outlets work. Much of the damage is subtle: no walls or windows are broken, but the structure and foundation seem to be less stable. I shine a few lights on my room, which is on the east side, upstairs. There are unscathed liquor bottles. The floor is flexible. I think that it needs a good solid layer of plywood to lend some strength to it. My mom tells me that the cause of this destruction is a person: someone left her a note, threatening her because of something she has begun. I think this is atrocious. I fully support my mom in her cause even though I don't have personal interest in it. I know there has been arson: a fire. There is a conflict and pursuit of the arsonist using hair samples to try to prove who was there. There is a group of four men, one of whom seems to be the runt of the group.

I look at a map that has a number of very colorful buildings on it. They're red and yellow, and made into odd shapes like amusement rides. The buildings are very bright. I see them: see the area to which the map corresponds. They line a shore a ways off in the harbor. The boat docks and the captain immediately starts taking tickets for the next tour. There are two grayish-white dogs on board. One dog has a bandana on, like a ribbon, to indicate that she is a female dog. We get off the boat and walk up a street to a restaurant. The area is older and has some brick. It's not dirty or uncared for, but is plain, quaint, and old. We walk. There are a few people walking near us, maybe going to the same place. We may pick up our pace to beat them to the place. The restaurant is on the left side of the road. We enter. I know the restaurant is about to close, and the bar will be open. I'm at a table with Wally in a small square room. There are short hallways into adjacent rooms where there are tables at which people are dining. We make commotion, tripping, kicking, or knocking things over. The people in one of the next rooms, behind me, seem to be upper class, \"proper and decent\" folks. They are annoyed by the ruckus we have caused, disturbing their meal. I think of closing the doors to the room so we won't disturb them. The table we're situated at seems to be quite open, in a well-traveled area of the restaurant. It is square, and made of dark smooth hardwood. It has a leaf on each side that flips up, creating a round table. I say to Wally that while the square table will accommodate four people nicely, since we have five people we should flip up the leaves to accommodate us all more comfortably. He doesn't seem keen on this idea. I think it's an easy decision for the comfort, practicality, and convenience of us all. I'm in an adjacent room. All the rooms have been decorated with tact and taste, and are neat and quaint, though others might describe them as elegant. There is a sort of mixer occurring: some event where people are socializing. A familiar face and voice catch my eye: my high school teammate Simon Naver! I stand up and turn around in surprise, asking myself if I'm dreaming. Simon is smiling and happy, and greets me energetically. I ask him in disbelief what the hell he's doing here. He replies that he's here because something happened to our old teammate Larry Rollie. Larry was supposed to be here to receive an award or honor, or was named to a special project or assignment in the community. Simon is here on Larry's behalf."

            "content": "Realigned Love  I'm at home upstairs in the large bedroom in bed with my ex-girlfriend Annie Thomas. The double bed is in the northeast corner of the room. We lay on separate side of the bed: no sex. She is near the wall; I'm on the outside of the bed. Neither of us can sleep, and we may communicate this to each other. We're tired but restless, unable to relax. It almost seems as if we're drugged up. We may go to someone to get drugs to help us sleep. The allure of touch grows between us. At one point I think that sexual contact between us always seems to happen. My sister Ramona is sleeping in the next, smaller, bed. There is a stereo in the room with a radar remote control that has right lights on it. Annie turns on the music. I'm worried that the music will awaken Ramona, or disturb anyone else in the house. It's very late at night, and the music will draw attention to anywhere or anyone. I think of this knowing also that the sexual activity that will soon follow the music is not the ideal situation to be found in when confronted by disturbed individuals. I look back in the small room, and see Ramona stir. At some point I know she has gone downstairs to sleep because the music disturbed her. I'm glad she has done this so we don't disturb her any more. I walk back to the bed. Annie is lying naked, her head pointing north, sideways on the bed. As I near her she spreads her legs wide open and bends her knees upwards: she is ready for and desires cunnilingus. I start slowly, rubbing my nose in the inside of her left thigh. She makes some high-pitched creaky noises: I'm tickling her. I lift her pelvis up a bit and lick the area between her vagina and anus. She laughs. I'm not embarrassed, uncomfortable, or at all deterred by this. She lies on top of me, and I think she will initiate penetration. The sexual contact stops. There's some discomfort between us. She asks me, \"How come... you're going to all these small places?\" She may have asked me this earlier before the music, and received a short, incomplete, ill reply from me. After a bit of a struggle we are both frustrated and she is about to leave. I say to her, \"Listen\", as I sit her down to explain myself. \"I've changed since being gone. Before I left my life was stable and constant.\" She replies, \"Yeah, you used to be able to laugh at anything, make fun of anything.\" I say, \"Now my life is not so stable. I'm not in the same place.\" Something clicks in my mind and I choose to use a scene from out past to somehow illustrate what has happened to me. I say, \"When we were first-years in college we talked in your garage over Thanksgiving break, the first time we saw each other since the summer after high school. I told you I couldn't or didn't love the parts of you that were new, that I didn't know. The same applies here. I don't think there is any fault, it happens to everyone.\" I say this to try to communicate that we change when we're apart and there is nothing wrong with those changes. Jake, Pia, and another person from the University of Wellington are there. They've heard our conversation and agree with me to some extent. I seem to have posed a clean, convincing statement of my view. It's about 5:00am. I think: how or why did these three people come to my house at this time of day? I think they must have just walking in the back door, since no one would be up to meet or stop them. I think maybe they're still out from last night, and wonder if they're drunk. We talk about the sleep cycle. One of the three says that the only sleep that matters is from 10:00pm until 2:00am. I say no: if one person sleeps 10-2, and another from 10-6am, there'll be a big difference! People seem to agree. I add that the person who sleeps 10-6 will live about 40 years longer! I tell them that all that information is in a book on the shelf, and I point to the bookshelf next to the south wall. I'm thinking of Moorcroft's 'Sleep, Dreaming, and Sleep Disorders', and I peer on the bottom shelf to see the blue binding of the book. I don't see it just then. The others get up and look. One of them pulls out a tall, wide, thick book with a clear plastic cover over the hardcover. It is called 'AIDS and the _____ (young athlete?)'. The man looks through the book. There are several removable sections in the book that he takes out when perusing it. Each section is on a subtopic. It's just beginning to get light outside. I look across the street. I see the outline of the figure of my high school classmate Chad Owens walking southward on the roof of my neighbors the Smith's house. Two of his brothers are near him on the ground. They're delivering newspapers. I stand up and walk over to Annie, who is standing a bit away from the bed. We share a hug. My left arm goes below her right arm and my right arm goes above her left arm. It's comforting, to her, I think. I feel strong and sure: stable, like I'm giving her support, comfort, and assurance. It's a warm, enjoyable embrace. We kiss, and continue to kiss as I slowly walk forwards, and her backwards, until she touches the wall. We're just to the south of the south window on the east side of the house. We're considering the different types of panes of glass in a window. It's as if Annie needs a window or pane or combination of panes. There seems to be a window with a single outer pane and two smaller inner panes that slide. The outer pane may be mesh: a screen. I say to Annie that she, \"Doesn't even need a salamander anymore\", because George Costanza has one."

There are physically strong and aggressive people involved in the conflict. I leave. I walk out of the room, picking up my ex-girlfriend Annie and carrying her out. We walk down a large hallway, like Scott Junior High, seemingly going west down the north hallway. I lift her up, and she sits on my shoulders. I have trouble balancing with her until she locks her feet behind my back. I walk down the hallway, crouching as we go below arches in the ceiling: low spots, so she doesn't hit her head. We near the end of the hallway and come to a large open room on our right. She tells me she thinks this is where she has to take a written test. I see many writing at desks, seemingly taking a test. People are waiting. I have a test to take as well: a different kind of test. It seems that Annie's test is more academically challenging. I think that this is appropriate because she is a keener scholar than I. Before I leave to go to my area, which is somewhere else, to test, she tells me that I had better call her, to stay in touch, or she'll track me down. She is serious. I feel good about myself because She cares about me, and I know I'll stay in touch with her. I don't know the room I'm testing in: I didn't make a point of remembering the room number. There's no time now to go back and look at the sheet that says the room numbers.  I'm in a wooded area comprised of a few large trees and lots of undergrowth and brush. There is a packed dirt path, curving very gently through the vegetation. There are many pothole-like depressions in the path where rainwater has collected producing large puddles that forces one to skirt the edges of the path. I come to an opening where the forest clears. There is a huge fallen tree with a sign or metal plate on it indicating its age as about 1800 years (1836?)."

She doubts the authority of the man I spoke with while trying to determine exactly who it was. She wonders if the person I spoke with was female. I say no, he was male. We talk about work, and I tell her I'd be more than willing to work a day or two at this deli. I tell her to just call me for problems or questions. I walk away with a red plastic sled that has a pointed tip, in my hand. We walk in this mall-like area. A food court is on our left. There is a place that sells fresh fish, advertising Walleye, Northern Pike, and more. I think, who would want to eat northern pike?

I return shortly, to more adequately prepare myself for the walk. It's a very cold, clear day. I estimate it's close to 0 degrees Fahrenheit. I start to pull on a few layers of clothing. I put on polypropylene bottoms, my gray wool socks with the red stripe, and my old Vasque hiking boots. I may put another layer on my legs. I wear a new red mountaineering parka that my brother Wally has just bought for me. I have me green wool hat and my black and maroon gloves. On my back is my backpack containing my yak's wool sweater. I have a pink hip pouch that I fasten around my waist. I'm inside. My friend Reed Maxwell is there. I toss him a pair of white and red striped polypropylene bottoms. Our friend Fiona Ulness is there. She tells me I look like a guy that is pictured on a milk jug. I look at some jugs, but do not see or agree with her. Our classmates Grace Hanley and Jill Foster are there. I walk outside. There is frost on everything. I seem to be on the southeast end of the lake. I need to walk north, then west, to the summit. My jacket is fully zipped and secured. I feel good: strong, prepared, and ready to go. Reed is next to me. I find I have a beer in my waist pouch. Reed takes a gulp of it. A woman yells at us for having beer. Reed pours it out of the clear glass bottle onto the ground. I put the empty bottle back in my pouch where there is another full beer bottle. A large group of kids walks towards us from out right, down by the lake. They're leaving the area, and herd by us. I walk, and others follow me. We go through a forest with tall trees and little undergrowth. There are two forest service men chopping wood in the crisp air. They're fully dressed for the cold. As I pass them on their right one of them says to me in a storm trooper-like voice, \"Fan out.\" I obey his direction and branch off the path to my left. He tells the others as they approach and they fan out as well. We reach an area that is a new track, all laid out. Two by fours bound it on each side, with fill in the middle. We're instructed to trample over the new portions of the track to pack them down. We do. We trample through rice, which quickly spreads from our feet to outside the bounded track. We also walk through mud. My friend Norman Noman and classmate Geoff Hamilton are among the group. I'm then in a group of people where a contest is occurring. There are some big, strong, powerful men there. It's possible that one could get hurt or killed. One of the big men seems to falter at his opportunity: he could, but doesn't throw a spear or dart a long distance. A man blows a dart at me. The contest involved direct physical impacts between two people. There is a large man with a mask. I get shot at twice from close range. Both four-inch darts pierce the skin of my chest, slightly to the right of my sternum. They do not penetrate farther, and I feel no pain. I laugh at the event. My body seems to be very, very strong, like it is impenetrable. It is then my turn. There is a bald man there, wearing a hooded cloak. I go easy on him, not really knowing or thinking of any good feats of punishments to impose on him. I spit a mouthful of a slurpee drink through a straw onto his head. He is like Spock from Star Trek. This is a silly and insignificant feat. It is embarrassing more to me for it's lack of aggression, but I don't want to really hurt the man."

She comes back in a moment and gives me more money because she calculated my change wrong, and she's correcting her error. When she does, she gives me too much back. There is a supervisor-like woman there. I tell them to take about 60 cents away from my change. There is a large rose bush there. Its branches are thinly spaced.

The small store contains mostly fruit. One of the men is from North Dakota. He grabs a brown rye. It's stringy, like the outside of a coconut. He takes a few bits, then gives it to me. I take bites. It's sweet and good. We hurry through the store, taking two or three fruits. I think it's dumb to take just a little bit: not worth the risk of entering.

The man says, matter-of-factly, that they can't change that now: they've already signed up. I think the jump is a crazy feat that I wouldn't do. I see a photograph of a long backpack. It's a \"full mountain pack\" and is designed to fit a person inside it. I walk a short ways and am on a rock or cliff. There are two people with me. Their intent is to jump off the cliff, for fun. The rock ledge we're on slopes downwards gradually, then increasingly, and then is a sheer rock face. It's such that one may be able to peer over the edge for a look. I start to peer over. I'm very afraid of the height. I get down flat on my stomach and crawl towards the edge. It's too steep for me, so I'm going down headfirst just to peer over. I turn around because going headfirst is too frightening. I slide on the rock, not having a good grip. I say to the others, \"I'm sliding!\" They are unconcerned and say that I'm not really sliding. The man decides to jump. He says that he's jumping. He trots past me wearing shorts and tall black cowboy-like boots with no socks. He may have a funny hat on as well. He runs awkwardly with his knees high and legs out, like a comedian. He goes at a steady pace, a bit faster than a jog, and doesn't pause when he reaches the edge, hopping off. He drops below the line of visibility and I see only rocks. The cliff is very high, about 200 feet. I'm not even considering the jump: I think it is disastrous for me. At one point I see a person with a black backpack or parachute on. It doesn't look very sturdy. It's connected in front of the torso by two rings that are four or five inches in diameter. I'm in a dark room. There are photographs of two people on the floor. They may be landing sites of the jumps. In one of the photos is my acquaintance Heather Salley."

The woman comments on how dirty and bad-smelling the bed is when she gets in it. I laugh. It's a pretty dirty bed, but I'm used to it: it's worn in, and I don't mind at all. I don't care if she doesn't like it. I'm in the bathroom. I'm naked and have a pink towel with fringed edges (from home) wrapped around my waist. I hear a noise outside. I run out the back door in the towel. I see a young woman with long straight brown hair, who was in my Philosophy of Psychology and Experimentation and Statistics classes with me, standing under the light near the back door. There is a lean and strong shirtless black man standing near the garage door. His skin is not too dark: reddish. He's holding a rubber band. His muscles are tensed. The rubber band may be stretched. He seems crazy or intense, almost in frenzy. Quickly I get others and myself in the house. I lock the back, front, and garage doors. I'm in frenzy. Someone calls 911. We're trying to keep the man out. Then the man is inside. Others or I tie him up with dental floss."

            "content": "Short Changed  I'm at a casino with others. Playing nickel slot machines, I have just lost three hours or three days wages. I'm leaving with a man. I see two nickels in a slot machine coin tray. I drop them in the five-card draw poker machine. I go for it all, holding an eight and ten of hearts. I draw three eights. My four eights pays 46,000 nickels. In order to cash out I must first put down one ace, which means to choose a red or black ace. The ace is for approval, it seems. It makes no difference on the payout, but has to occur. I do this, and want to cash out. The hopper on the machine, which I know as the kicker, is empty. A man from the casino comes around and I try to get him to help me with my payout. He won't help or pay me. He says I was in the group of three guys who were loud or had caused trouble earlier. I argue honestly that I wasn't part of that. He still won't cooperate, so I grab him by the t-shirt with both my fists and threaten to expose his unfair treatment of me by announcing the man's actions to all the people in the casino. He seems to change his mind, then. I have given him a time limit, and he returns in a minute with another man who starts to unlock the machine. This doesn't come to fruition. It takes too long, or the man doesn't pay me. I turn and yell to the people around me about the incident that has just occurred, and how the man discriminated and was unfair to me even though I wasn't in a bad group. A few people turn and look at me, listening. Their reaction is not strong. No one is rallying behind me. One woman asks about my statement. I explain to her what happened. Not only is she unsympathetic, but she also says I'm gay, like the three guys. I'm flustered and mad: none of us are gay! I leave out a door, crossing a road. I say to a woman that 'quite' is not a word that gay people characteristically say, but that people from Australia do. I say this to her as if she's dumb for not knowing it. I walk down concrete stairs around the edge of a building. There is a woman in front of me. I may walk too fast and step on her heels. I don't go around her, though the steps are wide enough to do so. I see my classmate Sara Henry, who looks a lot like my classmate Heather Beckers. She is in a gray car full of people. They seem to be going to school. I go inside the building. Two young men are painting the floor blue in places, using long dowel-like sticks with mop-like heads. I steal a stick, wrestling it away from a man. I run, trying to spread the blue paint all over the floor, or track it on the floor. I trip over some large pies that are red and blue in color, and try to spread them all over the floor. I come to a stairway that doubles back. Students of the play Grease are on the stage in a rehearsal. I run up the stairs, disrupting the rehearsal. I yell at and threaten the director and the actors and actresses. I say emphatically that the play sucks, the acting sucks, and that they're doing it all wrong."

Some of the bread comes with meat: it looks like two small loaves of bread with a clump of sliced meat in between them. There is one loaf of bread for 35 cents. It is from the 36-hour famine. It looks good to me: it's a big, long loaf of soft white bread. I grab one bottle of beer out of the refrigerator. Others are eating with me. I think of getting a beer for each of us: that would be a nice thing for me to do. My old flat mate Glen Ryan and my coworker Herald Jamison are there.  I'm in court, which is a deli. Herald is on trial. My name is called to go to the witness stand. I'm surprised, and feel pressure. I'm sworn in. I put my right hand on a tub of hummus. I hold the tub with my thumb around the edge and my four fingers over the top. I try to keep my hand flat while holding it. The woman bailiff swears me in, asking me if I promise to tell the whole truth. I say, \"I do.\" As I'm sworn in, my right hand and arm falls down, it seems as if the bailiff isn't holding the bible (hummus) anymore. I quickly glance at the judge to see if this makes a difference. The judge doesn't flinch, so I guess it's okay. I'm then on the witness stand. It's about six feet square bounded by a one or two-foot high fence made of wood or wire. The judge is to my right, at about 2:00. There are some ovens and some deli cases to the right of the judge. The prosecuting lawyer is questioning me. He is a young blond man. He asks me the name of the deli manager. I say her name is Patty. I don't know her last name, I say. He asks me if I see her in the courtroom. I say no, she isn't here. He then asks me if the inspector is there, meaning the health inspector at Mountain Market. I stand up and look around the courtroom/deli. I really don't know who the inspector is. By process of elimination I come up with a few people in the room who could be the inspector, based upon where people are sitting and whom I know has some other role in the room. I point out one man, and say that could be him. He is wearing a gray sweater and has gray hair. He is a big person. I say I don't really know if he's here: when we work we all have different tasks, and I just haven't taken notice of who he is. The lawyer then asks me several vague and indirect questions. I don't know what he's trying to demonstrate: where he's going with his line of reasoning. I'm very direct with him. I say very firmly, \"Why don't you tell the court where you're going with this.\" He arrogantly says that he will. He then brings up my criminal history. I immediately feel threatened and think he may expose my speeding ticket or expired tab citation, or my stealing meat and cheese from the deli. He starts to talk about my life. He is speaking pure lies, trying to degrade my credibility. He says I missed bail three times. I realize that this guy is talking out of his ass: he doesn't have a clue about me. I yawn and stretch and scratch my head in contempt for him. I look around and see my friend Sam Kingsley and a woman who works at Mountain Market. By their facial expressions I know they know that the prosecutor is making it all up. The prosecutor rambles on without making a point. The people who know me know that what he is saying isn't true. My lawyer, who is Herald's lawyer, but seem seems like my lawyer or is on my side-because I seem to be on trial-is a woman with short straight dark hair. She is pretty. As I'm testifying a timer for the ovens go off. Patty, who is near the judge's bench, switches some food, maybe ribs, in the oven as the trial takes place."

I use my left hand to stimulate my anus lightly while I masturbate. Pieces of feces come out of my anus. They are hard and crusty, some large and some small. I drop these pieces into the toilet. I think this is embarrassing and unusual that I'm masturbating in front of these people, but I don't concede the experience is any less real. It is also less disagreeable to me: some kind of social or mental compromise has been reached. Wally says there's no more lotion, which I had used to masturbate. I give myself fellatio by bending over. I'm not able to fit much of my erection in my mouth: just the tip. I decide I'll only give myself fellatio when I'm about to ejaculate. There is an area of the room where a shower curtain could be set up: there is a metal ring structure to which a gray shower curtain is attached. Wally comes over and helps me set up the curtain. There is a metal track-like structure attached to the ceiling, to which the curtain rings are attached. The curtain slides on this track. I'm wearing a pair of my button fly Levi jeans and white brief underwear, but my erection is exposed as we set up the curtain. I'm in the shower then, to have a private place to masturbate. There is almost no room between the shower curtain and the wall: no room to move, just to stand. I slide down to the floor, sitting, and lift the curtain over my head, putting it behind me. I unbutton my fly and continue to masturbate: I just want to ejaculate. Others see me, and I feel embarrassed, but I just want to orgasm. I give myself fellatio and semen comes out of my erection. It's very salty, and I spit it out onto a while athletic sock that I have. I don't have the physical sensation of orgasm, though I did suck some semen out, so I continue to masturbate to have an orgasm."

I try to fasten my safety belt but the chest strap for it is broken. Paul asks us to close the windows to help clean or defrost them. I think it's already stuffy in the car, and say it will take ten or 15 minutes to air out and clean the windows whether they're open or closed. There is a new boat for sale. There are men in dresses who appear, something happens as a joke. We approach Tressel. I go inside when we stop at a gas station. I see a manual camera for $9.08. I stop to look at it, and am very interested in buying it. The man who runs the station comes over to me. He is my acquaintance Jackie's father. He talks about Jackie, and asks me if I know her. I say yes: She was in Australia when I was, and I lived near her Salt Lake City. He makes a comment on how we better watch out now that we're back in Tressel, implying changes in her relationships with men. He may think I'm one of her old boyfriends."

I stand on something, which may be the white five-gallon plastic buckets, with covers, from Mountain Market, to get closer to him, in a final effort to understand his teachings. It is his time to go: to die or leave. Then, he is gone. I must follow him. I feel I must pursue him-not so much his physical body, but the whole person of him, and what he meant in my life. I lay in bed on my back. My right leg is bent at the knee, upwards. My left leg crosses my right leg: my left ankle resting on my right knee. I intend to will myself to go where this man is. I concentrate intensely, focusing all my energy. In some respects, I don't know what I'm doing, but I seem to have some sort of direction or knowledge that guides or directs me: an innate sense. I concentrate on moving. My body lifts up. I lean upwards and forwards. I see a pale image of my body separate from my physical body, which has not moved from the cross-legged position on the bed. My knees are a bit sore, and I think of the amount of time my physical body will be immobile: it will be uncomfortable to keep my knees still, but I disregard this. I continue to concentrate as my \"soul\" body separates from my physical body. I'm slightly surprised and amazed at what is happening, but am determined to continue the experience. I lift up out of my physical body on the bed. I stand, shakily. It's difficult to move. I'm a fledgling, a newborn: uncoordinated and weak. I steady myself and begin to walk, with increasing coordination. Then I realize I don't need to walk: I fly. I'm in an apartment. I fly through a doorway around the apartment, looking around. It is very neat. The walls are pink or coral in color. There is neat, modest furniture, very conservatively decorated. I want to see the man, because I know this is his realm. I will him to appear in one of two chairs with a small coffee-like table in between them. He does not appear. I realize that he is the apartment: that everything around me consists of him."

We are victorious, but it really seems like there is no big winner: it is just a duel. The play is over. I'm in a crowd of people. A group of people around me all have red or reddish hair. I feel that they are looking at me funny, as if they don't like me or have some interest in my and my actions. Most of them are not tall. I notice some of the women are attractive.

I'm very energetic. We fall on the ground, I'm still hugging her, very happy to see her. The hug ends abruptly. She seems to be taken back because of my energeticness. I feel out of place for giving her such a friendly, energetic greeting, because it appears to me that it was more than she expected and desired. We sit there, at a loss for words, feeling awkward. The conversation is dying and dull. Melanie's friend Erica Lange is then with us. We're sitting together, facing each other. They tell me that there are a lot of things I won't be able to do. I don't understand them fully, but from their tones I know they are reprimanding me for something I've done that they deem inappropriate. I think I must have done something wrong: offended or insulted someone, and now they are mad at me. I have no knowledge of what this could be. I feel uncomfortable, and get up abruptly and leave, saying a terse, \"Bye.\" I walk to Armstrong High School, which is not too far away. I enter with no problem: I am asked no questions. I see some people I know, including my old classmate Larry Erickson. Then I see my friend Bubba Hacker. Bubba's first comment to me is something like, \"Oh, there's the guy...\" to the effect that he and everyone else know what it is I've done that is so radical and bad. This disgusts me. How can everyone know what I've done, and yet I am oblivious to it, I wonder. I'm frustrated, angry, and confused. I just want to know what it is. I say I'm going to defecate, and turn into the bathroom near the freshmen lockers. Bubba also enters to defecate. There are two stalls with no door on either. As we sit, we look out towards the sinks. The stalls are divided, but due to the mirror above the sinks we can see each other. I ask Bubba emphatically what is going on: why everyone but me seems to know what's going on with me. He replies something like, \"You know how ____ (a woman) is attracted to you? Are you attracted to her?\" I honestly reply no. Bubba says, \"Well, there you go\" indicating that my lack of attraction to women is my problem. I'm confused, and don't believe what he's saying: I don't think that is the problem. He gets up and washes his hands. I defecate a lot, and for a long time. The toilet bowl is metal. Toilet paper comes out of the inside of the toilet bowl on the right side, like out of a box of tissues. The toilet paper is brown and yellowish, in clusters, folded like a tray of sliced deli meat. It seems to have already been used. My feces are soft looking and yellowish."

There are nuns there who comment on the trees surrounding us. The nuns say there are too many trees. I disagree with them, expressing my fondness for the trees."

Our fight is just a scuffle: no serious blows are delivered at first, but it continues. He is a short, slim man. He may be Mexican. I clutch the back of his head and smash his head and face into a wall. He falls down and lies on the ground. I see that his head is bleeding. This has an emotional impact on me: it is serious in comparison to our scuffle. There is just a small amount of blood, but it's significant: it frightens and startles. Me. There is a wood structure about two feet square made of layers of wood pressed together, a few inches thick. There's a head (of the man) smashed between some of these wood pieces. Bits and pieces of brain, skull, and blood drip and pour out of the wood structure. I try to figure out which way is 'up' on the structure so the blood and brains will remain in the fragmented portion of the skull and not drip out. It's of no use: every way I flip the structure blood still drips out. There is not much blood left in it. There are other people around. A grocery store is right next to where we are. I'm with several people. We all seem to be employees of the store. I will get off work in 20 minutes, at 9:30pm. I need to conceal this death, because it is scandalous. Some sort of plan materializes. It seems to be a group idea that I will have to implement myself. The body needs to be disposed of, and it needs to appear as if I entered the cab of the semi truck through the sun-roof-like opening. I'm in a bedroom that I know is mine. Many things are made of brown wood. There is a container of petroleum jelly on one of the beds. I think a man must have left it out there after masturbating. I grab one of the small flashlights I have. There are a couple batteries on the bed that look like size 'D', but are shorter and fatter. I climb up ladder-like stairs to the cab of the semi truck. The steps are made of wooden dowels, one inch in diameter and a foot long. I'm scared as I climb. I think someone may be in the cab waiting to harm me. I get up to the cab and see it's empty. There are a couple shelves with numerous items laid out very neatly on them. The shelves are the cab, essentially. There are wood cabinet doors around the shelves, like bars. I take several keys off a shelf. Some of the keys are gold, attached to gold key rings. Some keys are small, like our old square freezer key with a round tip. I have to use the keys to start and move the truck. I'm on the ground. There is a noise. It's a curious, strange noise that I find frightening. I dismiss and ignore it. I hear the noise again. Others look to see what it is. The noise seems to be coming from a pile of wood and metal scraps. Then its source is uncovered/exposed. It is something covered in black plastic. I know it's a person who is in sordid captivity, but is alive. I'm afraid of the person. I'm hesitant to get near the plastic, of getting involved in any way with the person or thing in the plastic, because I'm afraid it will harm me. Someone (me?) removes the plastic at one end, and we see it is a man. I'm afraid of him. He extends his arm, holding out a letter for me. I take them quickly. I'm involved in a situation that is greater than I: held and captivated by it. The letters may be from my sister Ramona. I'm scared of the letters. The writer, who is not Ramona, knows a lot about my life, and me and yet I'm unfamiliar with him. It seems there are instructions in the letters: things about me: my past, present, and future, and things that I have to do, from a source greater than I. I'm scared to read the letters. Others look at the letters and read them for me."

I get into my mom's Chevy Celebrity; I'm driving. The car is very clean. I go to pick them up. We're in a casino that we've stopped at. I play a few quarters in a random slot machine. I talk to someone-maybe Wally- telling him about a woman who defaulted on her loans, and then won enough at the casino to make a payment of $8,000 towards the principle of her loan. As my slot machine spins I say it would be nice to win enough to pay a chunk of loans like that. I turn and look at the slot machine. Numbers stop spinning: 2, 0, 0... As they stop one by one, I imagine the best: the jackpot, of all zeros after the two. The numbers keep flipping, and are all zeros! I have won 10,000 quarters! I start to laugh! Wally is there. Bells on the machine go off. The machine has stopped at 171,000,000 coins. Wow, I think: I've won a lot. I call the attendant over. She asks me if I want a check. I say yes. I reconsider and ask the siblings if we should gamble more instead of going to the theatre. They say yes, so I tell the woman attendant I'd like $1,000 cash and the rest in a check. She tells me she'll need my ID and a cologne sample. I say I'm not wearing any cologne. There is a hassle over my ID. They need a photograph to validate my identity. They ask for a photo of me with a moose! I tell them I don't have any such thing, but that I can get a photograph of me with my two siblings, Wally and Ramona. I stand in a circle with the attendant and a group of casino regulators as we discuss and argue over the ID issue. The regulators are against paying me without their conception of \"proper\" ID because they argue it will decrease their odds of winning. The attendant has the check in her hand: a stick of gum. I recognize the evil in gambling: the sickness it is, when all the regulators are there. I have gotten lucky, and should remember that I'm very susceptible to the sickness."

We're going to my home. We go past my house. A police officer appears behind us. The driver leaps off the motorcycle at the sight of the police car, and runs in a southeast direction, towards Roman's house, trying to evade the officer. I grab the handlebars of the motorcycle. The officer pursues the fleeing man. I think that I'm free from any inquiry of the officer. I wander over towards Next Avenue, going by Smith's garage, back near Mrs. Shelly's garage. I realize I'm going the wrong way: I could be going away from the officer, going northwest towards my home. I have a vehicle with me that seems to be a four-wheeler. I hear a vehicle speeding north, towards me, in the alley. I know it's the police car. I leave my vehicle and quickly dive forward into the long (one to two feet) grass in front of me, hoping that the police car will speed by and not see me; that I will be partially obscured by the white garage in front of me. As I land in the grass the police car comes to a screeching halt to my immediate left. I look, feebly. This deft officer has the fleeing man in his squad car. The officer gives me instructions as I lie on the ground on my stomach. He says to tap my knee and then my toe on the ground. It seems almost like a dance. I don't understand why he wants me to do this, and I question it. I don't think I've done anything wrong, but it seems that I have."

I examine the check closely, making sure I didn't get charged for something I didn't drink. The bartender is forced to throw the drink out. He throws it out outside the back door of my home in Oak Valley, which is where we are. The bill is for three beers and two shots."

We let our horses go when we get there. The horses, which I see as a metal radio-controlled car-like object, continue to go north. We turn back, walking on the ice and packed snow. We jump over ravines, snow chunks squishing beneath our feet. Some of the snow slides, breaking off in a small avalanche. The woman is swept down into a v-shaped ravine. Stephen is swept after her, but not as far. I tell him I'll grab his hat, which has fallen off. I do, then slide down the ravine to help the woman. I grab her hand. She has trouble getting her footing as I haul her up. Her feet slip on the snow. The snow is then gone in that area, and she slides down a rock ledge. She catches her footing on a rock just above the water. We make it back to the ending place. There are three people, including my friend Kevin Simpson, there that I know. I'm happy to return. I'm very tired. My greeting with the two others is lukewarm, but with Kevin my greeting is strong, excited, and happy."

I deny what I'm doing, and try to play it off as being normal or insignificant. I don't think she accepts this lie. We are soon in a sexual situation. She says something to me along the lines of, \"You wanna fuck?\", in an obnoxiously cocky, teasing voice. She is on top of me and pulls up her skirt to have sex.

A Bare Naked Ladies video is on television there, in cartoon form. My friend Niles Zelling is there. We both feel out of place in such mundane circumstances.

There are rows of seats that run perpendicular to the screen, on the sides of the space between the screen and the front rows. I know that these seats on the sides are Aquarius seats. I may be poked in the back by a foot. I hear my name. I turn around and see several young women sitting behind me. The woman directly behind me is the one that said my name. She talks to me, saying her name is Amanda _____, that I know her, and seems to ask if I don't remember her. She looks familiar. She is pretty. She has fair, clean skin. I look at her face, trying to identify, to place her. She looks a bit like my cousin Sandra Redding. There are several businessmen to our left. They talk loudly and obnoxiously for a theatre. They move up towards the screen. One of them flips over a chair, like a somersault. The others jump and tumble. They gather in front of the screen, talking loudly. One of them pulls out a handgun and points it at the head of another. There are between three and five men. The man fires the gun, shooting the second man in the head. The second man may fire back. Several of the men then have guns drawn and point them at each other. One man points a gun into another's mouth. The pointee redirects the gun into another man's mouth, who is then shot. There seems to be a blast of glass shards, from a gun, I think. Most or all of the men die.  There is a young blond woman working at a gate that lets cars into an area. It's dark. A bus speeds up and crashes through a gate. The woman may want to go after the bus, because that would be a duty of her job, but she would not be very effecting chasing a bus. She gets out a telescope that is three to four feet long. A helicopter flies overhead. She tries to spotlight the helicopter; it seems to be the runaway vehicle. The telescope may be a spotlight. I'm in an uncovered jeep-like vehicle with the woman. She is looking through the telescope as we ride fast. She is supposed to be looking through it with her left eye but seems to be looking with her right eye.  A woman is being pulled by a car that is going fast. She may in the car, but is somehow being pulled. She pokes and prods me with a metal wire, like an electrode or a bent clothes hanger. I'm grabbing onto something. The poking is painful. I clench my fists and grip harder, gritting my teeth. I'm biting onto the front of her blue denim bib overalls. I bite harder as she pokes. I may know her, and feel somewhat awkward when I pull away from her after biting her overalls.  People are gathering in a small parking lot because it seems to be a safe haven. There is a person who sleeps in a garbage can because it's safe. I am this person. I'm in a large garbage can. I flip the lid down over my head, peeking out of a crack. Other people in the lot are in vehicles. There is a house across the street. It has holes in it that appear to be shot into it. It looks like Swiss cheese. The holes may get larger. The house seems to be a shell, made of just the outside walls. It's falling apart. There is a power that is affecting the house. It is frightening and threatening to me. It is a natural power, like a storm, but is very destructive."

I don't have or use any ammunition. I point my gun and the ducks and pull the trigger. There is a \"click\" sound of the firing pin moving in the absence of a shell. I have a specific plan of attack: I want to kill some ducks, but I don't want to maim any. I want to do this quickly and discreetly. I maim about five ducks or birds. They're all still living and sit on tree branches, clinging to their lives. I know that someone has informed the police that this was occurring. I gather up the dead and dying ducks and put them in the garbage can in back of the house. There is a phone call for me: it is the police. I talk with a male officer. I explain my actions. Knowing there are limits for each species of duck taken, I tell the officer over the phone that I've killed two wooducks, one mallard, one teal, etc, all of which are legal numbers, even though I know I've really shot a bunch of wooducks. The officer asks me about my friend Nat Miller, whom I know was with me when I was hunting. I try to explain to the officer that because Nat is from out-of-state, he doesn't need a license for hunting, just a valid drivers license and a key. The officer asks me questions about this, and I long-windedly make up answers to excuse our actions. The officer finally says, \"Shine up your keys.\" He means he is coming over to look at Nat's key to validate the story."

I hold it up with one hand urinate on the ground with the other hand holding my penis. I urinate here, under the tent, because I'm scared to go elsewhere in the darkness. My urine foams and forms puddles as it hits the dirt and soaks in. I wonder about the moisture being a problem when I set the tent down: I know the tent has a plastic sewn-in floor that will probably be fine with muddy ground. I'm inside looking at photographs. There are many old photographs of our family that I've never seen, or have not seen in a long time. There are photographs of my parents, and the kids from the early 1980's. My parents slept out in a tent in the yard, where the sandbox would be. They were having marital troubles. It is later, and I'm going outside to urinate. I walk along the outside of a long white, single-story house. I stand near the end of the house in the dark. There is something there in the darkness. I may get a glimpse of it, or hear it in the bushes. I'm scared. I run away, back into the house where my mom and my sisters are. I feel frantic and frightened. I say I have heard it or seen something. I go into frenzy out of fear and agitation. I run back outside in my frenzy to confront this person or thing. I yell out to it, \"Come on you Jig Monkey!\" I'm fed up. I it there, and it flees. I see the shadow of it as it runs away. It may have pointy ears."

We approach a group of birds. We're hunting the birds east of the barn near the big hay shed. I slow as we get closer so I can load my .22 caliber rifle and fire early at the birds, which are crows. Most of the crows fly away. I'm on the second level of the barn. We're planning on shooting some of the birds from the small door opening. I load the clip for my .22. The bullets I have gotten are from my old housemate in New South Wales. Some of the bullets are too thick or too long for the clip. I load three or four rounds into the clip. We're going to shoot crows, owls, and other birds. My friend Kevin Simpson is there. A large brown owl is just outside the barn door opening. Kevin grabs it and kills it with his hands and a screwdriver. I have verbally prompted him to do this. There is a man that sees us. He is outside the barn standing a ways off, in the direction of the birds. He yells at us for intending to, or actually killing, the birds. He reminds me of David Hale from the University of Wellington. He has long brown hair. He starts up towards the bran to confront us. We need to flee. I tell the two others to go ahead: I'll catch up. I may say this so I have time to fire a shot and still get away. We flee. We go through the barn on different levels, in stair and corners. I climb in the rafters of one level to hide in a place that I think is a good spot. I lay flat in the rafters. There is a light bulb below me attached to the underside of the rafters. I see my shadow projected onto the floor, even though it should be on the ceiling considering the position of the bulb and myself. I must move, so that when the man comes in to look for us he doesn't see my shadow on the floor. In the route we take as we flee there is a dead grandma lying on the floor. We need to step over the decaying clump of a woman. There is a book there that is either written by or about Bob Mould."

I come to the house a lot to visit my friend Tiny Combs. His parents don't like that I come. There are two entrances in the front of the house: one on the second floor, and one right below it. I go to visit Tiny. It's winter. There is much snow on the ground, with 4-6 inches of fresh powder. There is a long black metal bridge that is on or over the sidewalk to the lower entrance to the house. This bridge is a plow that removes snow from the sidewalk, silently spinning and sweeping the snow away. When I arrive the bridge is spinning to clear the path of snow. This is a clandestine plow, something that happens in secret, like for Tiny to let me in without his parents knowing. I'm wearing a winter parka with a big furry Eskimo-like hood. I pull the hood up as I approach the door so snow doesn't go in my face. Tiny's parents know I'm coming. They may see or hear me. Tiny's father comes out and yells at me in a frustrated manner, \"Get out of here; just get out of here!!!\" I take off running. They think I'm a prowler or a burglar that is nagging them, since I visited yesterday too. I run down the sidewalk going north. I turn left into the alley. I run past a vehicle in the alley near Andy Jones' house. There is a woman and dog standing outside the vehicle, which may be a mini van. I run to the next block into the short alley again, and turn left onto the long alley, going near Booker's back door. There are several feet of crusty snow. I'm in the alley of the block where my home is, where the old blue house was, kitty-corner to our home. A Chevy Blazer roars by, going north, in the alley. I take cover so I'm not seen. People in the Blazer are looking for me. They don't know that the person they're looking for is I: they think the person is a stranger, a nuisance, and a pest. Really it is I, and they don't know."

This paper is moving from person to person across the world. The point is to see what kind of people will come in contact with the paper. The woman wants me to take the paper because I'm low class, because the paper will come into contact with all kinds of wealthy high class people on its journey, so giving it to me would keep the paper's journey in balance. I think this woman is full of crap. I leave, not taking the paper. I walk in the hotel. There are several different theatres in the hotel, each with different color front doors. This place seems to be like Las Vegas. There is a sign for a gambling room. As I walk towards it I see a blackjack table. I have not gone into the room yet: the doors are closed and I'm outside the room. The table is out in the open lobby area. A black woman with long dark hair is at the table dealing cards, apparently to herself. I enter the gambling room to take a look at the poker table in particular, but also just to look around. It's fairly dark. There are some pool and other recreation tables, and a couple slot machines. I wander over to a table that I think is poker. There are several men around the table, playing what I see is pool. One of them immediately asks me to play with teams. They are playing for money. I'm leery of this, and I say, \"I don't know, I'm not very good...\" I look in my pocket and pull the change out. I have $1.50 in quarters, a penny, and a nickel. It costs $36 to play a game. They seem to include me though I don't have money. One of the men on the other team starts playing and puts in five balls consecutively, easily. My partner and I are then out. My partner is a not very good either, maybe not even as good as me: another chump they rounded up as well. We have not played, and have not paid to play. We were in, and now are out. It feels no different, if not a bit relieving that I won't have to do anything. I walk out of the room. There is a very old vending machine with a pastel blue or green front. Nachos cost 59 cents in this machine. A small sign says the machine is closed."

I seem to be with a woman who is submissive, or to whom I act very dominant or aggressive. I take two ice cubes from the ice cube tray at the top of the freezer to use in our sex. I hear a faint noise and see a flicker of color reflecting in the main windows. I walk over to the living room and see that the television is on. I think this is strange because I don't think I left it on and no one else is home. I shut it off and go upstairs. I see the light in my housemate Norman Norman's room is on, though I know this to be my housemate Hank Anderson's room. I enter my room and find Norman there. I give him fellatio, and his penis becomes erect. I tell him to turn over, and I rub an ice cube on his anus, which flares out like layers of a blossoming flower, like a vagina. He thinks this is odd. I look over and see my door is open. I try to shut it but it won't stay closed. Hank is in his room, and as far as I know is unsuspecting of this behavior. Norman may think Hank knows. Our sex ends. Norman is in the bathroom wrapped in a towel, about to take a shower. I go in and start to give him fellatio while he is standing there. He still has partial erection. I suck hard. I'm kneeling, and I may urinate into the toilet while performing fellatio. In a short time he says, \"____ ____ oh please stop it.\", which tells me his is in the ever-so-sensitive period at and after ejaculation. I slow and am lighter with my sucking motions. We have locked the door. Norman ejaculates into my mouth. The semen tastes warm and salty. He comments, \"God, Kenneth\", indicating that I'm good at giving fellatio. I feel nauseated from the semen. I spit it in the bathtub and take a drink of the running shower water to rinse my mouth."

We drive north on Home Avenue down the hill. We get to the bottom of the hill and turn right on 3rd Street. As we do a red compact station wagon turns onto Home Avenue, going by us. I see a young man driving it, waving at us. I see it is my friend John Thomas. He puts his car in reverse and backs up, approaching the side of our car while waving. I want my dad to slow down, not sure if John is waving to say hi or if he needs something. John is then driving forward, following us. My dad slows and pulls off to the side of the road, saying he's going to pull over on 3rd Street near the police station. He thinks the police station is still on Bauer Avenue in back of Jefferson School. I tell him that the police station isn't there any more. I'm annoyed, confused, and angry with him for not pulling over right away. He speeds up, doing almost 50 miles per hour, which makes me even angrier because now he's prone to getting a speeding ticket. He seems to be glad that things are speeded up. John has speeded up, following us. We quickly approach a fenced in area with chain link fence gates. My dad drives right through the gates, speeding. There is nothing in the fenced in area. It is unused, like a vacant lot with a few puddles and leaves. We speed though the fences. We pass a few people, maybe including an Asian man, around the wreckage of a car. A police siren wails in the distance in front of us. I think for sure we'll get a ticket. My dad slows down. As the police car approaches us it goes by us to the scene of the accident. My dad has been spared a ticket. There may be another police car going to the scene of the accident. I'm standing with dad nearby. There are two other men with knives. One is closer to us than the other. The one that is further away throws his knife, which sticks in the ground a short ways away from me. The men are challenging us to a fight. I pick up the knife and mock the men, saying it's dull. I do this after rubbing my finger across the back of the blade near the handle. I then realize that this is not part of the blade, and that the actual blade is very sharp! One of the men is Chuck Norris. We fight, eventually all four of us are fighting together. They are very good fighters, and use their skills to make us immobile, by pinching a nerve or poking a precise area of our bodies. They have specific fighting knowledge and tactics. We subdue them. We go into a barn. This seems to have something to do with releasing or disposing of the men we've captured. There is a ledge in or near the barn. Below the ledge the ground is covered with uncooked pasta noodles on one side and seafood on the other side. There are food piles covering the ground. I know that the pasta area is the _ Ocean, whereas the seafood area is the Asian/Indian Ocean. Either I push the two men into this, or they fall because they are beaten and tired. Then I'm in this area without the men. I hear someone coming on the ledge above and I hide. It is the men, and they are physically okay, and following me. I try to evade them, climbing and scurrying around. I hang from a ledge and moving by \"walking\" with my hands. I escape the grasping hand of one of the men. I get to a window in the barn to jump out. It is high up: 30 feet or more. I hang and jump, seeing if my training has paid off: if I can sustain the fall. (What training, I do not know.) It has paid off. I know that I take the fall in many ways, but I don't experience it more than once. As I fall I do several dances: the Rice Walk, the Combo, and the Swag. I land solidly and feel strong. The land is tan and dusty around the barn where the fight was. There may be a group of women about 100 yards from the barn, as if to cheerlead."

He makes a comment on how he is attached to or likes this vehicle, and how he will miss it and won't know what to do when he is without it. I back the Trooper out of the driveway and park it next to the curb on the right side of the road. It's a stick shift, with a \"sticky\" shifter, not a smooth one. I may put it in gear to park it. My aunt Elaine Grains has bought the house two doors down from the one where we are. I'm walking back towards the house. Someone has a big box of Cuban cigars. They say the cigars were left over from my high school classmate Todd Warden's party yesterday. Todd was sick at his party, and cigars were passed out. I get a cigar and go into the house. I unwrap it, but don't know which end to bite the tip off, so I don't bite it. The cigar unwraps a bit. My uncle Dannie Redding and cousins Henry and Avery King are there. My housemates Hank Anderson and Norman Noman, and my supervisor Carly Lunch are there. There is orange juice in the refrigerator. Melvin is outside playing with a younger cousin. He has a red light, like the ones we're using in physiology lab. He is holding the light, which deflates when he nears a stream of hot air being out by a small heater. I may instruct him on how to avoid this. The family seems to be divided into two groups for a big game. One group consists of adults, who weigh more, and the other group of younger people and kids. It seems to be lopsided, so grandma Redding runs from the one team over to the other waving her arms comically. All of the extended Redding family is then in a big circular gathering. There is cotton candy being made in the center of the circle. Everyone is supposed to get a turn eating this cotton candy, but we all hold back, waiting for others to do so, so as not to be rude. Then someone says that newborns/young people should go first, so Melvin runs up and gets some cotton candy. From there, there is a pause again: people are reluctant to go. Rusty goes and comes back, sitting on my right eating his cotton candy. He says he's not going back to get more. I'm outside with a group of people sitting near the alley at home in Oak Valley at the south end of the garden near the tree. We sit in the dark watching the sky. There are lights that move across the sky at rapid speeds: too fast to be a plane, satellite, or other human object, but too slow to be a shooting star. I say, half joking, that it may be a UFO! One of these objects explodes. I think it has been shot. My friend Sarah Reed is there, behind me. I can't see well because there are branches in the way, so I move. There is a loud blast. Everyone stands up, startled and concerned. I say, \"That was a shotgun\", and then feel silly because many Redding men are there, and I know they know what a shotgun blast sounds like, so my words really just indicated my inexperience. Rusty leaves with Melvin to protect him. More blasts appear, and we see that there are fireworks in the sky. I sit down where I have a better seat. My friend Nat Miller is there. I see the silhouette of a helicopter circling close to us. It's dark and hard to see. I'm concerned about his because it seems like a war helicopter. I know there is one person in it, and later realize there are two. I'm concerned, and as the helicopter starts to come in to land at the north end of our block by the alley, I flee, to get out of sight. I know the men in the helicopter are from the army and will kill indiscriminately. I run out front in the yard, but then cut back towards the back yard. I see the two men approaching from the direction where they landed. They look lethal. I run though the back of Trammell's yard, down near the white house, across Home Avenue, and over a fence near the Giles' yard. There is a large machine at Giles' house that crushes people. There seems to be a narrator now. People are not spared. The army is responsible. There is a big spring in the machine that crushes people."

We're at a small store to get some supplies and fun stuff. Stephen and I look at large packages of water balloons: 20, 100, 500, or 1000 in a package, costing from $3 to $120. Some of the balloons are very large and are too big for water balloons, I think. An old man with a shopping cart is on a beach. I walk up and look at a newspaper in his cart. He comes over, thinking I'm stealing it. I was just showing Stephen a photograph on the front page of a man catching a trout on Lake Erie. It's the fishing opener. I say that it's a trout, but at second glance it looks like a bass. I walk out into the water with my pants on, going knee deep. I see a bunch of clams, some of which are very large. I pick one up. It looks old, having a lot of algae and growth on its shell. Its shell is large: ten inches long, and six to eight inches wide. I grab it with both hands and smack it hard against a rock. I look at it and see that the shell hasn't cracked. I flip it over and smack the other side hard. The shell still doesn't crack, but it's easy to open. I open it and rip the foot out of it and throw it down on the floor. I straighten the top of the clam muscle, to be flat, and it looks like half of a heart."

I seem to be on the Redding family farm, or a farm with open spaces. They two tigers are there, a little ways off. Others and myself are scared of the tigers. Someone hands me a .44 caliber magnum for protection. I open the chamber and see there are no shells in it: the gun is of no use. I go into a small shack, which is the farther north of the two old white sheds at the Redding farm. I try to close the flimsy wooden gate behind me. There's a gap below and above the gate, which wouldn't protect me from the tigers. I look on the shelves of the shed for ammunition. I find many shells that are close to what a .44 caliber magnum shell looks like, and I try them in one of the six chambers, but not many of them fit. I find one that fits. It looks like a longer, thicker .22 caliber shell. The tigers come around and enter the shed. I am terrified. I make no quick movements. I try to act smoothly and calmly, like I'm not worried at all by them. I know the tigers are extremely powerful, self-contained, and potentially deadly for me. They wander through and leave. I know one bullet isn't enough, so I find more."

She tries to get us to order a steak. I am reluctant because it's early in the morning and I don't feel gastro intestinally stable. She tells us to call her if we want to order. Melanie and I move to a different, nicer table because someone else has moved. I squeeze through the space between the seat and the edge of the table, which is a booth. It feels like we're on a date. The waitress brings our shake, which is like a brownie sundae on a plate. We both it eat it with forks. We're overlooking a city park with tall trees. There are some people under a big tree. A branch is high above them. Melanie makes a comment about doing something mischievous with the tree branch, tricking the people. I chuckle, unexpected to hear this, and say something along the lines of her comment being her shadow side. I walk with her and encounter others. We go into a house where my friend Tim Zelling lives.

There's a small triangle piece that is the scope. It sticks up off the barrel a little ways. I look though it and the edges of the field of view inside the scope are blurred, like in a normal scope. He takes out the bullets for it and shows me. The look like .22 caliber shells: about a half as long and look empty, discharged. The bullets have to be placed over small nub-like projections, like a hairbrush with thick bristles. The shells have to be placed over the numbers, with ten or 20 in a bunch. It takes a long time to load the gun. Grandpa has several small boxes of these shells and a larger shoebox size box of ammunition as well."

We drive from the highway, which seems to be the Thru Highway, going north from Superhighway 100 near by teammate Olie Kecker's house. We get to a neighborhood near Riverside school. I have seen a map with a thumbtack hole in frequently visited places. I see our home in Oak Valley and a tack hole worn in there.

I talk to the man that I owe money to on the telephone. He asks me about he money. I don't have the money, but I don't tell him this flat out. I hint at this, and indicate when I may get the money."

There's not much snow on the ground, which is soggy with a few ice chunks. I'm surprised at the accuracy with which the boys on my side throw. The boys that are throwing at us are throwing weakly: we bat their snowballs with our hands. I'm walking south towards Brimson with three people, including a man named Alf from my physiology class. The people I'm with find clear plastic bags with stacks of cookies in them. Alf finds a bag, the other two people find a bag. There are different kinds of cookies in the bags. These people may need the cookies for a project at Brimson. I eat one of two of the cookies, and feel guilty because the students need them. We get near Old Avenue. I'm with two people. One of them, a man, says we should hurry to the humanities building to copy the videotape. There is another ground of people. The man in my group says we should hurry, to beat this other group, to do something. I walk near Social Science Hall and Old Main on the way to the humanities building. I see my classmate Julie Adams and friend Sara Miller. I forget Sara's last name. I see a man on a bicycle. He says to me, \"I know what you did.\" I feel guilty about doing _____(something). I just feel guilty. Something was going to happen with the cookies. The plan is to hurry and copy the videotape."

They appear large, but I can fathom their size: I understand the size of one mountain in particular. I think it's actually not as large as it appears. The class is having a program of presentations. Hank and I and the man are supposed to present today, but the class hour is almost over: it's 1:48, and there are 12 minutes of class left, so we'll have to present tomorrow.

We're both wearing life jackets, to float around. I carry a light brown wooden handled axe, to hit things on the surface of the water. We start to swim. I hear that Duke and Kentucky are in overtime for their basketball game. We're swimming near the south end of the lake with three other people. I probe the water in front of me with the axe so I don't swim into a brush pile or into the mucky bottom. Many people are swimming at the lake. A male and a female police officer arrive. They ask us suspiciously what we're doing. I think they've been tipped off that we're doing something wrong. I try to conceal the axe. We're in shallow water near my carp fishing hole. The axe is on the floor of the lake, about 12-18 inches deep. I try to nonchalantly stir up the lake bottom so sediment settles over the axe. The female officer asks me if that is a paddle, pointing behind me. I turn and see the axe handle sticking out of the water a few inches. I try to cover it up, saying that it's just a little paddle that I use, and hope that she won't look at it. She moves towards it. I see the handle is white plastic, and is actually not a handle, but is the leg of a white plastic chair, the kind we have at the Whitman house. I quickly tell the officer that this is actually a chair that I have with me so when I get up into shallow water I can sit in the chair. We both see it's a chair. She doesn't ask me why I said it's a paddle. She thought the white plastic was part of a cooler, and that I had been drinking. She asks me, \"Have you been drinking?\" I reply honestly, smiling, \"No, not today.\" The older male officer says Army is losing. He means losing in college sports. I ask him the score. He said they lost 315 to 17! I know that Duke and Kentucky are in double or triple overtime in college basketball."

I tell them that I have a key to the Science Hall, and can let them in. I'm actually not sure that my key will work: it's a holiday, and door locks may have been changed. I'm in an airport. I see my friend Holly Lapson, who is coming back to Brimson after a very short Christmas break to take a test. She is wearing headphones, and doesn't seem happy. I talk to her, and am concerned about her. Something bad has happened to a friend of hers. I feel sympathy for her, and want to talk with her. She is not very loquacious. I see my friend Melanie McDyss, who is leaving. She is wearing makeup. I'm in a hurry, but up to this point have not overtly rushed. Now, I start to move quicker. I'm carrying three bags for my friend Esther Thurman. They're not huge, and they are light: I can carry them all right. I also carry a plastic cartridge, about 3x5 or 5x7. I get to the terminal. I need to find a flight departure screen to see if Esther's flight has left yet. There are many computer screens around, like video games. I need to find a particular computer named stigmat, sigmalon, or something like stigma. I look at many computers before I find it. I kneel down to insert the cartridge into the computer. This cartridge will produce a message on the computer from Esther about a departure. I man named Joel that I recognize from Babe Ruth baseball a long time ago walks by, recognizes me, and says hi. I say hi back. I insert the cartridge and attend to the screen. I push button A, and then realize this is wrong, and will cause some unimportant message to come up. I quickly press button B to get the important information. A screen appears that says the flight is now boarding! I should hurry! There is a message from Esther on the screen, saying something like \"You go girl...\". I grab my backpack off a luggage carousel and run! I try to find the gate, which is 23, 27, or 28. I'm frantic! I go the wrong way down a hallway. I realize this and realize where the main hallway to the gates is: back the other way. I turn around and run. I jump off a staircase, over a railing, over the railing of an adjacent staircase, and land on another staircase."

There are five bases. I'm on second. My friend Tom Napper is up after me. He is a weak batter in our lineup. It will be lucky for me to make it home with him batting, unless by a fluke he bloops the ball into the outfield and it takes a bad hop or gets by a fielder. I have to make it home when he is up, or it seems I'm out. He makes contact, and there are errors in the field. I slide into the next base, where the ball is overthrown. I get up and round the bases, scoring at home. Tom rounds the bases too and scores: an inside-the-park homerun. He has driven in 13 (or 15) runs."

I get mad at them for this because the venison will spoil, and the deer will be wasted. The Ramos' are very nonchalant about this, saying the meat will spoil or has spoiled, and can't be used, oh well. Adam and I feel differently. We say because it's cool outside the meat will be fine. The bacteria _____ need 45 degrees Fahrenheit to grow. It's cool: for sure less than 50 degrees, and probably less than 40. We argue for the use of the meat. I argue that they can't just shoot a deer and not use the meat: one just doesn't do that. It is Brian's birthday. It will be dusk soon: it's 6:15pm now. I hurry to get ready for the evening hunt. I usually like to have much more time than we have now. We go back to hunt. I argue with Stephen and Jose, saying that their logic is terrible, and is ignorant, narrow-minded, and even backwards.

There are steps that lead down to a garage area, which is very spacious and neatly organized. We go past several rich people. In the garage there are several cars suspended off the floor about 10 feet, held in place hydraulically. I walk under and around them, to a large open shed or garage. The ceiling is about 50 feet high. There are many large metal axe head-like pieces that drop from ceiling to the floor. These are about seven feet long and two to three feet wide, with sharpened edges. There may be between 20 and 50 of them. They drop from the ceiling, crushing or slicing anything beneath them, and are then lifted back up. I try to avoid these, jumping from side to side, running and dodging them. On the other side of this garage-like building is a set of closed doors. I near this other side, and on the wall I see two large rectangular yellow panels. They are arranged vertically, about 20-30 feet long, and a couple feet wide, parallel to each other. I know that now is the main enemy, the full main enemy that I have not yet met. I do not see the main enemy, but know that the time has come."
