He had very little money and George, after finally convincing me not to finish school, said maybe mother was right. I had made up my mind, however, and would not hear of a postponement. The next part is after we are married. Although I did not see the ceremony, I knew it was very simple. Someone asked where we should go on our honeymoon and I can't remember where I said, but they thought it was the place in Europe named the same. I was embarrassed when I said it was not. Then I thought maybe I should have married another fellow I know who would have taken me to Europe, but I immediately dismissed this from my mind. Mother said then that the place we were going was very nice, although neither of us had previously been there. This made me feel much better. Next we were sitting in a large dining room. George was drinking a beer and I had a coke. All of a sudden it struck me that this was my wedding night and I got nervous and sort of afraid. I then asked George to order me a double shot which I never did get to drink because I woke up."

I told him he was foolish to drive all that distance since it was snowing so hard.

I'm in front of a mirror shaving under my arms, but the hair seems to be at least 6 in. long."

He came right away, but we didn't go to the dance. I seemed to have forgotten all about it. He surprised me very much slipping a diamond ring on my finger. I had no idea that he was going to propose to me. He told me all about the house which he had almost finished building. I remembered that he had started it 6 months ago, and when I asked him why it was started to long ago, he turned his head away and looked a little bit ashamed, telling me that he had started it for some other girl. I didn't feel jealous though. We were both extremely happy, and talked for a long time making plans. The setting of the dream was not too clear. I think the last part was somewhere near my home. It was a long dream and once my whole family was there. They were all very happy for us."

I reached into my mouth to examine it more closely and discovered it was extremely loose. As I tugged on it, I accidentally pulled out my entire lower left jaw bone. The teeth, however, remained in perfect order inside my mouth. Calmly I washed the blood off the jaw bone, which incidentally resembled that of a parrot beak calf whose picture I had noticed the day before in my genetic book. After the bone was clean, it very definitely assumed a different color and shape. It looked as though it were now made of pale blue painted wood, half my own size, and shaped like a rod about 1 inch diameter twisted around and around in loops. Tied to it was a piece of blue satin ribbon. I remember feeling very guilty about what the dentist would say when he found out I had removed my own jaw bone. Then the thought of how angry my mother would be occurred to me. Therefore, I folded the blue jaw bone in half and hid it in my closet. I knew that the dentist would have to pull my teeth since they were not held firmly in place by the jaw bone. So once again I reached into my mouth and ripped my bottom teeth out all in one strip. Again I washed them off with water and noticed with surprise that they were filled with tarnished copper--not silver at all. I was also amazed when I discovered none of the teeth had roots, but instead were held in place by little copper plates. Again I felt very guilty. How could the dentist fit me with false teeth when I no longer had a jaw bone? Suddenly I looked once again in the mirror and found with great relief that all my teeth were back inside my mouth. I remember thinking to myself that all this was only a dream and soon I would wake up. No words can express how thankful I was when I realized in my dream that it was only a dream."

I could only find 3 of them. Two were 3-1/2 year old boys and the third was the nursery director's girl, who's also in my group. I looked for the children's drivers to take them home. I was carrying one of the boys who, though in real life is quite large, felt very light. We finally met one of the drivers who took the little girl. It was very dark and raining hard by now. Since I couldn't find the 2 boys' driver, I began to look for my car, which had been parked somewhere downtown. I couldn't find that either. Finally met the nursery director.

I remember I only had on tennis shoes and therefore couldn't go with them. I rationalized that I would stub my toes with these thin tennis shoes. Therefore I stayed to prepare art work for the children because I knew the head teacher wasn't capable of it. As I was doing my art work (making balloons for them to color) 2 or 3 girlfriends appeared and we began to play cards. In the midst, my mother-in-law called to ask if we were having fun. I knew she was really calling to see if her son (my husband) was home safely. Next, I was getting my coat to leave the nursery school and I met a girl I grew up with but haven't seen in a few years.

Next I was at a rehearsal of the Cleveland Symphony. I was there to conduct the orchestra in Beethoven's 5th Symphony. Szell, the conductor, showed me the score and then he left. The first page of the score was words only, no music, and I was perplexed. I turned the page, lifted up my right arm and began to conduct. It sounded terrible, as the players, who said they knew it so well, played without music. I had to stop several times and once I reprimanded the piccolo player for not coming in on time. Szell returned and yelled at some of the players. The players told me secretly when he left that they were playing poorly because they didn't like Szell.

We talked of generalities, such as the weather, etc. Finally the ride seemed to be over for everyone left the bus. All the while, however, I was not conscious that the bus had been moving. We went into a large building in which each sorority had its own particular room. To get to the room of the sorority I was with, we had to go through the room of another sorority which I disliked intensely. But the room was empty and we went through into our own room."

She then left me alone and I heard her shut the door. I pulled open a little drawer and a vast quantity of jewelry--necklaces, bracelets, earrings and brooches--tumbled out. They were all of garnets set in antique gold and I coveted them more than anything else I ever saw. I fondled them greedily and I decided that, since I was alone in the room, I would take them. I was about to put them in my pocket when I experienced a definite feeling of wrong doing. I felt that the Virgin was looking down and disapproved. (I am no Catholic.) I put the jewelry back in the drawer and as I did so I noticed that the stones had undergone a radical change. The deep red of the garnets had become gray--colorless--lusterless.

In some of the fields, white skirted peasants in straw hats were sowing seed with a rhythmical precision. I stood on the hill and looked at everything with a peaceful pleasure.

The people wept and screamed as they were driven down into a huge ditch. They were forcibly thrown down into it. Their baggage and possessions were flung all around them. I rushed forward and threw myself into the ditch with these expelled people. I learned that they were Spanish but I never found out why they were exiled.

There were bluish clouds of smoke, people were dressed in colorful clothes. The scarred tables and chairs were the same as they really are. I was happy because I was in a place I knew well and was fond of. I decided that I would have a beer and called to Al, the bartender, to bring me one. He refused to do so.

The lights were very dim and I couldn't see many other people in the club but everyone I did see was colored. This didn't seem strange to me and it seemed that I was almost a Negro because I couldn't think of any white friend's names. Then I was in B's apartment, sitting on a divan with my head in his lap. I had been crying and he was stroking my hair and face. Then I thought of S, the girl who is very fond of B and doesn't know how I feel about him (she's in my class at Mather and we're quite friendly.)

He asked, 'what's the matter?' and I answered nothing. He had the most understanding look on his face that I have ever seen.

We were right on the lake and I couldn't wait to lie on the beach in the sun. But suddenly it got cloudy while my mother and I were drinking our orange juice. I lay on the sand a while but it got windy and cloudy and began to get chilly. Then suddenly, my older sister, who is 26, was there. She wanted to relax too, but it was too cloudy. I didn't like our apartment at all. It was freshly painted but too dark and the ceiling seemed so low that I had to stoop. I was very dissatisfied with it as living quarters."

I had on an aqua knit dress, one which I received for Christmas and a large turquoise ring. Extending from the cliff was a long, narrow diving board. My friends and I decided to go swimming and in order to do this, they ahead of me dove from the board into the water which lay way below. Being last and terribly afraid of height, I can remember the terror I felt as I walked out on the diving board. My sense of balance was not constant and I found myself swaying from side to side. Finally I took a deep breath, hoping it would last until I reached the water, and jumped. Then we all swam in freezing water out to a float. When I arrived there, I looked at my ring and the turquoise stone had melted and turned orange. The last thing I remember is that I thought that the stone in my ring had been made out of dehydrated vegetables."

When mother and I got there, she had already picked out her hat and had it in a bag. As we were going in the store, I told mother that a natural straw would be nice with Sonja's coat which was bright green and I pointed out just such a hat. Sonja put on her chosen hat which was an ugly shade of green with a bonnet brim trimmed with brown ribbon. She was determined to have it so we got it. When we went to the car, we had other packages.

He also had a mustache. I was shocked she would marry such a person. I started to go up the aisle in order to kiss the cross. I noticed that I was carrying something in my hand. It was a bottle of cologne. The cologne was very yellow. When I came back, I saw my other girl friend. I looked for a fellow from school that I knew, but I couldn't find him. There was also a fellow that I had known two years ago. He was someone I had liked. I was supposed to go to a party he was giving after church. I felt how inappropriate a party was on Good Friday. I felt guilty that I should plan to go."

When he came, I found out he was married to my cousin who was staying with us at the time. He was dating me in order that he could see her. They had kept their marriage a secret. My first reaction was that I was glad he married her instead of me. Then I was surprised and puzzled why my cousin would want to marry him. I didn't consider him a desirable husband. I had refused to go out with him and had even told her I didn't like him. Then I was riding in the car with them as they were going on their honeymoon. He held her hand and again I couldn't understand why she wanted to marry him. Then I was angry that they had used me in order to keep their purpose a secret."

I had to go away for some reason and it seemed as though someone went with me, but I don't remember who it was. When I came back again after about a year, everyone was changed and I was very sad because of this. The next part that I remember was in a bathroom. It was quite large and had a very large bathtub. Two girls were drawing water for a bath. One of the girls was a friend of mine who lives in the same dorm I do. She had her towel around her just as she always does before taking a bath. She was very excited because she was going to take a bath in such a big tub."

We did not go into the dance, but got back into the car again. The other girl sat in the middle. I was impressed by the weird atmosphere. It was very windy and misty."

He was carrying the watch and I was carrying the ring."
