I put some eggs in my pocket and they broke and ran down my leg and out of the bottom of my pants. I took pants off. I went to a gambling place with George in a tough neighborhood. I took my wallet out of my pocket and put the money into watch pocket. We went in, one of the guys saw me put the money there. He reached for it and I said no. I said, \"I got 3 kids and just bought a house.\" One tough guy came up and I slugged him. I punched him and he bounced back. Then they ganged around me so I fled. They gave chase, but I flew up and they got into a car. I flew over a river into some woods and hid in tall weeds. I saw them coming. I went into a building and there was another superman. We went together. With a disguise. It was raining. We saw one of the kids. We ducked him and got into a building and that was a trap. The roof was low and the doors were locked. I couldn't fly high. They had two lions for me. I was afraid, but I couldn't get away so I grabbed one of the lions by the mouth and whipped his body on the floor. I cleaned him up so they got a large dog to get me. He was easier than the dog. I went into the next room and the gang was there. I cornered them. Now they were afraid of me. There were dice games and card."

Rose was there and she razzed me how I was carrying the object. I was looking at the mountains. It was cloudy or fog. Then it cleared and my vision was clear. I saw snow. And I looked at a peak way far in the distance and could see a large tree. I went over the Hilt's shop. I thought of a bull chasing me. I would go into the shop and he wouldn't get me. I went into the shop. It was barren empty. A boy came in and I said, \"What you doing here?\" and he asked me the same thing. I said, \"I am partner and have a key. \" I go into the next room and I see a gang of people coming in. They were going to have a party. I looked for my shoes and found them.

Trixie got hold of her broom and I grabbed it and threw it away, then went on my way. I put up a kite. It went straight up. Then it came down and flew right in front of a window and stood up. It was a beautiful dress. I was loving up and kissing Julia. Her kiss was so soft, her lips seemed to melt."

A lady slid down the bank, then she tried to climb out. I was on a farm in the fields. I had a steel nut in my hand. I wished to see a rabbit and I did. I threw the nut at him as he ran and missed. I hid in the tall grass. I had a club, stick. A kid who knew me came yelling, \"Get out of my farm boots. I see you.\" He knew where I was. Two fellows and a lady came by us as we lay on the ground. We saw small bugs on the ground. The man stepped on him and he ran away. We said, \"You didn't get him.\" I was riding a bicycle uphill with Hank on the rear. It was hard peddling, but I made it. Audrey jumped on a rock. It moved on the water, then turned into a yacht. Bob had the captain's cap on. I took it off his head, then I put it back on and let him be captain. He said, \"Plug up the holes,\" and the crew did it. Our TV was on a blink. I noticed tube no. 9 was the one."

Ann and I were greasing the, or oiling the bridge and I said, ÒThat black bastard, how he was looking at your legs.Ó And then I noticed a couple of colored men and they heard me. I knew they would come after me, so Ann and I went away. I opened up a can; there was oil in it. It was thick so I mixed or stirred it. The Laskos were looking for us. They walked by our fence and asked if Cutlers lived here, and I said no, but Evans lived here and they didnÕt know who we were. Cutler was dead lying there in the house. I picked up a large grape off a grape vine and ate it. Was it sweet. I was chasing a young girl. She was bashful and shy. I was riding a bicycle with Barbara thru Fairchance.

Thee were rags on it also. Gramp was below. I threw down some paper for him to start a fire. We were like on a mountain top. I was trying to write a theme or poem in the cafeteria in white. Ann was lying on the pile sleeping like in a bed. I looked at the time in New York and it was 5:45 and my watch was 7:00 p.m. That was Big City time. I went to see Dr. Allen. I found him at a party. The nurse was boiling potatoes; then she made rice. Dr. Allen was eating some. Dr. Allen checked me, and he made a diagram of some organ."

I pushed her foot off my hand and was it ugly. Her sister stuck her long, thin fingers after the ball and then pulled them away. I said she has six fingers or was it toes on hand or foot. Joe and Bill were playing golf. I went down into a big hole. I saw two balls. They were new. I hid one or covered it under the sand with my foot and I threw the other ball up high when one of the fellows came for it. Then I uncovered the other ball and put it into my pocket and intended to give it to Bob. A fellow was riding or walking with me. He insulted my wife. I got angry and was going to hit the fellow, but I changed my mind and told him how wrong he was by doing such a thing that he was sorry. I saw a streak thru the sky and it seemed to run down into the earth. Then a fire started and people were running towards it to see what happened. It was frightening. There was a stream of water running near the fire. It went into the earth."

I came home and there was a man sitting there. He was to have bawled out my wife and seemed to be a distant relative of hers. I started to bawl him out and I laid down the law to him. I told him if he opened up his mouth again I would throw him out on his ear. I threatened him and I was angry. Then there was a woman there later and I threatened her also. I bawled her out like I did the man. I picked up my overcoat and was going to hang it up and it split on the collar from old and weakness of material. I went down to Gordon Park and there were streams of water overflowing and running down the ditches and brooks. The water was heavy and high after a storm. Then later it came down to normal. We went swimming. A girl took a dive and she hit a wall with her head and was under water dazed and going deeper. I jumped in and got hold of her and brought her on top. The water was deep, up to my nose. I waded and took the girl ashore. I saved her life. I was swimming upstream, floating like, and I was going fast by my easy strokes. I dreamed the horse I played in the fifth won, and he did."

Bob and I were watching traffic. We sat near the road and a fellow on a motorcycle almost ran over us. We moved further back from the road."

I noticed it was plugged up, but I opened the door and commanded them to beat it or I would blow their heads off. If they charged me, I would be out of luck for the gun would explode in my face. They walked off frightened and I was master of them. I came to a ghost town where everyone was a spook or dead person and alive again. One man jumped out of a window. He had tattooed arms and someone said, \"Look how he floats thru the sky,\" and he really floated at leisure in any direction he wished. I worked my hands and legs and I flew up, a boy spook got on my back and asked me if I would take him to the show. I rode him and when I flew into the show, it was full of ghosts sitting in the auditorium. I saw my family sitting in an upper corner. I was afraid for them. I flew down front and I saw Grandma Evans slumped in a seat. Her head was down on the floor. She was bent forward. I raised her up and I noticed she was headless. I asked her if the ghosts cut off her head and she said they did and promised not to hurt any of my family. Grandma did that just to save my family. I sat and watched a show. I saw Sid Hamlet.

I saw a few stop and people get off and on like a streetcar. The boxcars ran by their own power. There was no engine pushing because I looked, then I found Ann and myself on a bicycle. I was steering it. I had a horn in my hand that I used once in a while and I would let go of the handle bars.

As he went along from in front of him out of the ground a wheel would come out with food or drink and Andy would take it. An old-time wagon wheel. It was getting late for work. I looked across the street and there was Al Novak with his wife and son. His wife was talking fast and Al was just listening. I walked up to them and asked Al if I could ride with him to work. His wife let go of some gas and said nothing. Al spoke up and said, \"That's nothing. It's healthy and John and I feel better, don't we?\" I looked up at the top of the building and said, \"I didn't think it was so high.\" I counted the stories and there were 11 of them on the top floor a dog was on the windowsill looking down at us. He jumped and I said, \"That's a dead dog now,\" but he landed on his front paws as though he jumped only a couple of feet. He was friendly and came towards us. I was home by Grandma's. I saw a cake on the desk. I started to eat it. It was a whole-wheat cake. We had an elephant Audrey was not afraid of him. He was immense. I asked Grandma if she had any trouble with him and she said sometimes he doesn't want to eat and now he doesn't. Audrey went up to him and pulled on his tusks and one came off and still it seemed like his trunk. It came off like a pipe, but the elephant sucked it back in place. Grandma took it off and was going to feed him. While he was in an enclosure waiting, he was a horse then. Grandpa came thru the room. He didn't say anything; neither did I. We seemed to be on the outs. I was by Grandma's again. I was in the backyard. I worked my hands up and down and made myself go up off the ground. Al and his wife were there again and the next time I was going up, she came up to me and gave me a goose and then Al came and got hold of my legs and I couldn't go up with his weight. I found some brass cans in the yard, so I was tossing them over the fence. I went into the house and I noticed a door going to the right. I asked Mary where that went to. I went in a couple of rooms were to the right and it went right thru to the front room. It was decorated nice and the furniture was appealing. I went outside and into Bendrock's yard and from there Mike showed me the way home was remodeled. They cut the house on a certain angle on two sides. We were sitting around at the banquet. We had on our old clothes on my coat to keep warm and so did the rest of my fellow workers. We sat around on the outside of the building and kept warm with our coat collars up. There was a cat on a driveway. Kolesar took a shot at it with a pistol and missed by 6 inches. The cat came near the end of the driveway and shit on a pile that was quite big already. Kogler took a pair of shears and tried to pick up some of the feces, but it wouldn't stay on the shears, so he put he dirty shears under Kolesar's arm. He had his shirt off and was nude from the waist up. Kolesar brought down his arm on the shears with the feces on them and held them under his armpit, not knowing what was under his armpit. There was feces smeared on his back. I thought what a dirty man Kogler was. I walked by a mirror, looked at myself and noticed I was quite handsome. I walked by again and looked at myself again and was convinced I was handsome."

I picked up some rocks and threw them at it and it ran away. Then I saw other animals near a stream of water. I threw rocks at them and they ran away. Then I threw a rock at an arch where there were business stores and a lady was standing there. I didn't do no harm. I met Martha, my first girlfriend. I laid her on the ground and pushed her clothes up and bared her nude body, then I was intimating her. I watched her face and I could see the thrill and satisfaction of her face. I seemed to know it was a dream. My wife was there and I didn't' seem to mind it and neither did she. Then I got up and had intercourse with my wife. I stopped in Fairchance and went into the new post office. It was pretty big. I looked it over. It was nice. I asked one of the women where I could find the dead letter dept. and she said in the basement. I went outside and a fellow was following me. I thought what if he would rob me. I had some money on me. I was surprised he said, \"Hi Evans.\" He knew me and I didn't know him. I saw two boys on a hill. I had an idea they would light the dry grass. Sure enough, I saw smoke and they started to run away. They came down to town and we started to chase them. They ran down one street and then back. I ran along the street and figured they would come back and I would catch one of them. Sure enough, one came back and ran across the street. I ran after him and caught him. I grabbed him by the arms and held him tight. The cop came over. He was taking down his name. While he stood in a corner, I had an idea he would try to get away again. When he did, I got his legs between mine and he fell caught by my legs. Ann and I were upstairs. It was hot. I heard a breeze blowing outside. We went by the window and the curtains moved in and some nice cool air came in. I gave Grandma a dollar to hold for me. She held it or a while and then came over and said, \"Here is your dollar. You will come over and ask for it later.\" I looked at the dollar and there was about 8 or 9 dollars. There was a two-dollar bill included. I knew I made a mistake. I was thinking should I give it back or keep it. We had a little baby boy. I took him for a walk, then I let him go and he could walk by himself. Carter and Bob were eating eggs. Carter had a big pan full. When he ate quite a few of them, he found a roasted chicken in his eggs."

There was a hose near me and the water was squirting out of it on my feet. I turned it down the hill and it squirted on him down below. I walked over to a small park. People were sitting around a sort of small lake, which seemed to have a swift current of water. It would bring in objects at a swift pace. I looked out and an old model Ford coupe came in on the current. It took the Ford around the lake twice at a fast pace, then it came to a whirlpool. This whirlpool spun the Ford so fast I moved to protect myself from being hit from any object that would break loose from the Ford as it spun at a high rate of speed. Finally it stopped dead, the door opened, and out came two small boys on a platform. As they got off, the Ford sunk into the whirlpool. It was an excitable scene. The boys said they were going to store and the current caught their car."

I counted them, then put them into my coat pocket. I was rich now. It was heavy. I then was in my own home with the two wealthy men. They had a bottle of whiskey.

I shook hands with him and said, \"You're looking great.\" He said his sister took sick and when the doctor examined her, he said, \"She will have to quit smoking cigarettes, a dope.\" I was looking at the results and I can't recall the winners now. I was traveling thru the mountains. It was night. I put on my bright lights and I cold see dust on the road from the car in front of me. I was at Amel's. I looked and I had a small double barrel shotgun. It had two small holes and the shells were small and seemed to be hollow."

We came by a small puddle of water and there were a lot of water bugs in it. Audrey told me to walk thru it, but I said, \"No, those bugs are all germs.\" Then we were up in a tree with Kotnik. He put a rubber tube or hose in his pants and there was dirty, muddy water coming out of his body thru the hose into a tube beside him. The tube was full. He turned the hose on me and got my pants dirty and wet, then he turned it on Bob and got his face all muddy. I didn't like it. I cleaned Bob's face and we got off the tree and were going to get the car to go home. I called Audrey, but she stayed in the tree with Kotnik. Then I saw Bill Kotnik again draining himself of the mud again. I stopped at a gas station and the fellow wanted me to go to the left of the station to the gas tanks, but I said, \"I can't get in there; it's too narrow.\" He wanted to bet me I could, so I said, \"I'll bet you $55, no better $1000, that my car can't get in there,\" but he changed his mind. Later I proved to him it couldn't get in the narrow space. I drove my car to the edge of a cliff and stopped on time. It was dangerous."

I then went out looking for the party. I was like a detective, but I had a hard time tracing her. I bought some meat and the butcher was trying to cheat me. When I bought it, I threatened him and he knew he was in wrong, so he told his partner and his partner came out to me and offered to take this meat back and give me better meat. I said the butcher sold me a lot of meat that was too fat and he gave other people good lean meat. He said he would take care of it from now on. Then he walked back in the butcher shop. I felt sort of sorry for him so I was going to go back to have it fixed up. I told Carter about it and I had sort of pictures or statues of bulls and I show him what he tried to sell me a small one and a large one instead of two large ones. I saw a dog's head. It was a double head with three eyes. Joe Grabar, another fellow and myself were trailing a suspect. We were like detectives. We came to a cave in coal mine and I looked down and saw our man. We had spears to throw at the man and he surrendered. Joe went down into the hole, which was about 20 ft. in diameter and then I yelled at him to pull a gun on the man, which he did. Joe called me down and gave me a gun and he left. I held the gun on the man and he didn't seem to fear me so much. He was trying to get away. I pulled a little on the trigger and said, \"I blast you if you try to get away.\" Then the man was a woman and she didn't fear me either. I held the gun on her and then I awoke."

I called for Ann and Audrey to come home because there was a storm coming up. I saw a maneuver of our Army trucks at night that fooled and puzzled the enemy from attack. It seemed to be a triangle shape where the trucks drove or kept driving to the front of the triangle and then backing to the rear and keeping up this movement. The arrangement seemed to puzzle the enemy. I was in a hardware store. A young fellow was working. He had a pair of pliers and wanted to open catter pins. I took the pliers and said, \"Someone should invent pliers that when you squeeze down on them, the jaws would open up and open the catter pin.\" I saw Al Lasko. He showed me his teeth. The front uppers fell out when he wanted them to. They flew out on the floor and then they flew back into place. He seemed to have a string attached to them. I said, \"Let me see your teeth,\" and he opened his mouth and I looked into it. He had an arrangement of a mirror in his mouth which showed teeth in his mouth all over. I was on a shanty. I let myself down by holding on the side of the roof. I was sitting on a box car. I moved it at east back or forth, then I put on the brake. I saw or heard Xippi Pigeon."

We were supposed to be exonerated but the fellow who did it was a politician and was going to let it go, and we would be really guilty. Joe had an angle which would prove that the man framing was the guilty one. When this man found out, he put his henchmen on us. We went in flight and were chased and pursued. We ran and walked up hill and down thru cornfields of fodder, stocks. The pursuers were so close that they were about 100 ft. behind. They had swords. One of the swords fell down a small cliff. I picked it up and threatened the pursuers with it and they ran back. Then we went on our flight again thru cornfields, over a hill and then down. Now it was Bob, Jerry and I who were being pursued. I had my car parked in a big garage. There were other cars there. I told a woman, ÒLook at my car, how rusty it is, and at the holes in it.Ó I had another car. There it was, a new Lincoln. It was mine and still not. It started to back up and ran into a parked car, but just hit the bumper and did no damage. I saw a lot of beautiful pottery. I was swinging on a swing. I pulled myself up the rope, up the tree to where there was a caterpillar. He picked up some kind of small bottle and oozed out a white matter and it expanded like foam. Then a spider came out and put his jaws around the caterpillar, but didnÕt harm him. Peter A. was supposed to be in a hospital. Helen Solander was here and I talked to her. Bob and I were sweeping or cleaning up. I looked at the wallpaper. There were ash spots all over the walls and ceiling. I asked Bob who did that and he wouldnÕt say anything. So I said, ÒI know who did that. It was Jerry.Ó Jerry came in and I was getting angrier and angrier till I flew off the handle and I started to cuss and yell at Jerry. I told him to get out and stay away from here. As I was pulling myself up the rope, my little granddaughter was hanging onto me."

I had some kind of contraption that had a handle on it or it was glass squares attached to a slingshot handle and inside these glass squares there were rocks or stones. I was looking at them and couldnÕt make it out, what it was. I was waiting for a streetcar in Fairchance, PA. One was coming, so I hurried to the stop. When it stopped, there was a crowd waiting to get on and they all got ahead of me. I thought I would change my position and get on the car sooner, but I ended up with some kids marching by from school, so I went back to the old crowd. I was looking for the menÕs room and there were mostly women in the rooms. I was changing my pants, had them off when a woman came in. I hid my legs behind a corner or wall. Then I got to my locker and changed my pants. I was late when I came to where this woman was and she was still there with a clean pair of slacks on. I patted her on the rump as I went by."

I bounced it against the wall and it kept bouncing till it stopped, but Albert came by and stopped it. I yelled at him to keep his hand off, but he didn't and I threw a peach at him, hitting him on the head. The flattened peach fell on the ground and the ball was also a flattened peach. There were 3 balls to choose from a box and the game cost 40 cents. I said all I would play was one ball. Famous Gift came to me in my sleep."

He said, \"Follow me,\" so I walked into the country and woods. I thought I was walking into an ambush. We stopped in a spot near a stream eventually and I was on my guard. He said, \"I would punch your partner and then hit you one and it would be over.\" I said, \"Don't fool yourself. When you would be hitting my partner, I would be on guard as I always am.\" This surprised him, so he said, \"Let me show you how you would go about it,\" so I shadow boxed in front of him and he was convinced that I was pretty good.

A fellow came up to me with something on his mind. He said something about my car and kept on hinting. I said, \"I parked my car properly.\" Then I asked him what did he mean and he just hinted and would not say what. I got mad and was threatening him, but he wouldn't talk. We walked to where the car was and there was a gang of fellows standing around. One of the fellows came up to the car and hit it and put a couple of dents in the body. I pushed him away and told him again, \"I'm going to sue this fellow. You know who he is and you are going to be my witnesses.\" They didn't answer me, but turned away from me. This fellow came at the car with a pitchfork. Me and my partner kept him away and finally got the fork away from him. Then we found out they were peeved at me and the car because I laid a big cardboard box on top of a tub of water. When I took it off, they were relieved and I apologized. I said, \"I laid it there without thinking that there was a tub of water under it.\" We drove along where the streetcar tracks were from Fairchance to Rivertown. I had to straighten the wheel for peanuts. He was driving. The fork was broken in the fellow's hands when he came at the car by me and my friend. I looked up the date of my insurance and I saw June 1."

The town was revived. I was up north again. Three fellows had gold. One fellow weighed it. It was in containers. Two of the containers weighed the same and one was a little lighter. Then he walked away. He didn't want to. Ok, this one is saying for a three-way split. The other fellow went over and weighed the light pack and gave it the ok stamp. I was going to leave the next day to go home and the big man asked me if he could ride with me. I said ok. I was driving my car and another car. I was driving by remote control. All at once the remote control car started to come towards the left to my car. I stopped my car and the remote control car crashed or collided into another car head on. I saw 7Ñ7 for a fraction of a second. I wanted to know what p.p. a horse would run the next race."

I got to them through my knowledge of the chief and when I got to the shields, a guard jumped out to stab me. I got hold of his hand and pushed the dagger away from me. I gave him the high sign and he relaxed. I was a friend. I then left and had to get a fellow to go with me to kill the guard. I heard it was Joe Hlavah. I came to a meeting place and asked for Joe and a fellow pointed to a table to the right. I looked there and there he was. I got him and we got the flying shields. I saw a parade of them coming our way. I yelled at our men to get off their horses. We would meet with the shields and Indians and make peace. I was doing a fancy dance for a dance I was to act in."

Bob dove in and was under water and came up, then I put my head under water. A man came by and said, \"You have a nice waistline. Look at me.\" He was shorter than me and had a big belly. I was sitting in a chair on the porch. I commanded a big dice about three-inch square to move around and it did. Then I told it to float in the air and I commanded it to stop in mid-air and it did. Just then someone, a young girl, came in and tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"Dad.\" I was angry she did that because I was having fun with the dice. I gave her a slap across the face. Andy and Emma Mayer came by and said I was asleep in the chair, but I still thought I was awake. I was going to school. I came to the school and I was late. I looked thru the door window and the class was in session. One of the students was reading out of a book. I got a little frightened that I would make a few mistakes in pronunciation and Bob was in my class. So I walked down the steps and went outside. There was a little fellow batting stones and he could bat one better than a fellow could throw to its target. He hit me with one in the foot and I threw one at him and hit him. Then I ran and he was after me. I was gone for quite awhile till my sister Sue came into the building where I was and looked into my place. I stood still like a statue and she went out and then looked back and at me and recognized me. They said  I finally bought myself a place. It was a good thing. I looked at Judy and she had a big needle embedded into her leg about an inch or more deep, and she had another needle in her hand. She tried to pull the needle out of her leg, but couldn't. I got a pair of pliers and pulled it out. Then we were going to north Roylton. I was sort of flying and it was foggy and the wind was blowing very hard. Judy was like a boy and Joey Duke was with us standing next to Judy. He was a little taller than Judy, but Judy's head was larger and her legs were heavier than Joey's."

He thought it was my end, but he was surprised when he saw the beheaded snakes in the water. I did the same with rattlesnakes before the copperheads. I passed the test. The man met John Lasko (deceased) and showed John what I did to him when I met him before the test. I made a dare of gouging out his eyes or poking at them. I met Helen and June Lasko."

When we got out of the way, we looked at the post and it was long and way higher. It was tied to the top with long ropes. The post men were setting it into a hole and had to hope those ropes tied to the top of the post because it was such a long post. It must have been about 20 ft. long. Charlie Charvat was with me when we ran from under the post. We sat on someone's back porch and were looking at the sky, which was getting ready for a storm. I heard the young fellow in the house accusing us as suspects of a murder. He came out later and had a gun in his hand. He got Charlie, then came at me, pointing the gun at me. I raised my hands and he accused us of murdering Arendas. I said, \"We didn't kill no one. You can take us to the police and they will let us free because we are innocent.\" He was puzzled and then was deciding to take us somewhere with his friend and beat us up. I said, \"Oh no, you're not going to do that. You take us to the police and we will be freed.\" While he was thinking of what to do, I picked up the gun he threw away and I forced him to take off the handcuffs. He did and we went to his basement and got in our car and we were blocked by him and his friends. I didn't want to run over them and that convinced him we were innocent. We were outside talking as friends. A half dollar fell out of my pocket and rolled near two men who were sitting. They both saw the half dollar when it stopped rolling and were oozing up to it backwards to pick it up, but I picked it up and we watched the two reach to pick it up and there was no money there, to their surprise. They looked and it was gone. I came to a place where there were men sitting at a gambling table. Jack Lasko was one and he had 6 sixes that was high and winner of $600, but the man said something, he didn't want him to win now because he would be pinched for a gambling charge. I saw about 4 sevens and 4 fives that others had. I counted the 6 sixes. My dad and I were climbing up on top of a shanty. He said, \"Let's see how high you can kick,\" so I had my foot on the top and I kicked up and said, \"Look how high I can kick.\" We then got on the top and sat there. I met Rose Lasko. I started to love her up. I was kissing her and feeling her up at the same time. Carter was doing exercise on the floor. When he was through, he got hold of Bernice's gown or what she was sitting on and he pulled it from under her. She fell back on her back and her vagina was exposed. She had no hair on or around it. She was embarrassed as we looked on and Carter got a kick out of it."

I bumped her body with my generative organs against hers and she liked that very much. She said, \"I want children and can't have them.\" I said, \"Why not? What's the reason?\" She said, \"My husband gets it in, but he can't come.\" I said, \"If you need a little help, I would be happy to help you out.\" So we're lying on the garage floor. She was on top of me and we were intimating. The garage door was partly open. I closed it with my foot, but still we could be seen from the outside. I slid on my back with her further back into the garage, but the walls seemed to hold no protection. We still could be seen. Two women and a man came near us and one of the women said, \"Will you fix me up for $5?\" and I said, \"I will.\" There were boys in our back yard. I told them to get out and stay out."

Denny Carter drove his dad's car to PA and back and said the gas was leaking."

I gave him a $5 bill and he gave me two thin sheets of silver, a little bigger than a dollar bill and he said that each sheet was worth a dollar and I would not have any trouble passing it. Later I had it bunched up together. I got close to the wall and looked to see if it lined up with the wall on the other end. I was on the 6th floor of the White's building in the flats. I looked down the sidewalk and it was high. I looked twice. I said, \"If you would jump down, you would kill yourself.\" I was working in Dill's and John Sereno, the boss looked at two clocks on the wall and said, pointing to one of them, \"This one is the right time.\" I looked at the sky and the air was polluted with smoke and bad odors. I had a carrot. I was washing it off. It was kind of soft, which meant it was old. There was a pile of carrots near me. I was tempted to take one, but it would be stealing."

I saw them doing it so I was going to call the police and they knew I was. So I started to run, then fly in flight. I flew over the colored neighborhood. Some young colored boys saw me and tried to catch me, but I stayed out of their reach. The wind started to blow and I had a hard time flying against. it."

I got off the track and poured some gasoline on the tube, then put the valve stem submerged in it so the gas would enter into the tube. The engine was near now, so I told my friends to hold their heads down as it passed and we would not be seen. I was with Kenny and Steve K. from Dill's. We were trying to put on a big cover on a ball like which was about three feet in diameter, but had a hard time getting it on so it would cover the ball like a cover that is on a baseball. Then we had Steve to act as the ball and we tried to cover him like we would a ball, but it wouldn't work. Then we were talking of doing chin-ups. We had clothesline ropes strung across. I said that was too weak to hold us up. There was an alligator and a cat or turtle. I'm not sure now. The alligator jumped up and he went up like a rocket, then came down. The turtle also went face on the ground and the alligator chased him, then jumped on the turtle's back. The turtle went up a tree fast, then made a quick stop, which made the alligator fall off going up the tree."

I was going to school and I was going to look at the entries, but had someone around and was not in the mood to look. I saw George G. He had baloney for lunch. Louie Kaufman came by and took a piece of the baloney and ate it."
