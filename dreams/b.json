When it was done, we  sat down. He said, \"Your hair's messed up.\" I said, \"Oh, dear, not again\" (He had his arm around me). He bent to me and said, \"Yes-let's mess up a mustache\" and then he kissed me. The kiss was so real! Then I dreamed that Nate came home. I met him in S City at the bus depot. He was 6 feet tall and all muscles. He grabbed my hands and then threw his arms around me and kissed me,(All these dreams were when I was fast asleep). [BL]"

The doctor, who only stood there, didn't even catch the baby. For that matter, I didn't even see him. I just knew he had to be there. The nurse started to do the after birth things. The man pushed my table around fast, in circles. It made me dizzy and frightened. I cried out and clutched the table. They laughed. \"Don't be so silly,\" they said. The nurse then repeated it. She rushed me on the table across the gym to the opposite wall. I got off the table. They were taunting me. I walked back across the floor, determined to make it on my own speed, but knowing I shouldn't walk because I could start bleeding. I got back on the table. The child was placed on my lap, \"stomach.\" I looked at her. She appeared about 6 months to a year, sitting up. She had large feet, white paten leather shoes, a wide smile, teeth, and was in a dress. I thought to myself, \"I know I agreed to carry my Uncle Philip's (Dale really) child, but they at least could have given me a new born.\" I felt used. My parents came in. They had made the preparations for all this last night. They were apologetic for not telling me the whole. My mother confessed that she didn't even tell her sister, Aunt Charlotte about the child, and Uncle Philip in a letter even though Aunt Charlotte was asking her to intervene on her behalf with Uncle. I looked at the child and noted family resemblances to Lisa (a cousin), and \"Jolene,\" (another cousin). I felt cheated because nothing of me was in the child, like it would be if it were my child."

I came to an immense hall (floor only, no roofs or walls). This was heaven. There were 2 large buildings at each end of the halls. Libraries were there so we could pursue learning, seeing as how we'd be there for an eternity. I met a girl (possibly Laurie). I asked her what we were supposed to do. She just shrugged and pointed to a door. We could pick rooms to live in. We were placed in general areas so that as other people we knew on Earth died, they'd come to the same area so we could be together. I asked, \"What about people who remarried?\" She answered it was no problem, everyone got along together up here. There were viewers in the library so we could watch people on Earth. I entered a room. There were several shower rooms. My 3 girls were there. If you got in a shower, you were transported back to Earth to live out another's life. I started to enter a shower room. My 2 eldest girls, Dovre and Ellie, had gone in. Then my youngest, Paulina, suddenly changed her mind and veered into another shower room. I hesitated and then followed her because I was worried she'd get into a tough area. I was transported to the body of a young, pretty blonde woman in the process of drowning in a raging white water river. I felt a little aggravated because I'd have to die twice.

Instead of falling, he manipulated the chair so we \"free floated\" sideways in the air. It was fun. He was calm, somewhat detached. I felt branches gently touching the back of my head.

At this point, I was sitting on his lap, facing him, looking up at his dispassionate face. We came to a stop on solid ground. I smiled and said, \"Wow.

Couldn't I at least even make my mother a cup of coffee? He went on and on. I was scared and started packing to leave. He had suddenly gone insane. He kept talking in that low voice.

She shrugged. \"It always does that.\" The operator finally answers. She was very non-caring. \"What do you want?\" She asked. I said, \"Connect me with the state mental institution. My father has gone insane.\" My father was staring at me in a cold, hard way as I said it. The music was there. She said, \"They are closed.\" I looked at my watch. It was 1:10 a.m. I said, \"What shall I do?\" She said, \"Oh, have him go out, downtown, and then if he hurts someone, the police will throw him in jail.\" I was appalled. I repeated that remark to a group of people in the room like I couldn't believe my ears at the non-preventative approach. The crime had to be committed before help could arrive. I hung up. Then I called the operator back. I asked her to connect me with Jim B. at the University. She told me a pleasant story how she went to school in Wisconsin with his wife, and then connected me. It rang and rang but there was no answer. Then I was aware of fear and that music from the phone. My father's voice said, \"Hello, or Ya.\" It was very cold and menacing. I started to explain, \"I am Barb Sanders. I went to school 2 years ago, do you remember me?\" A long oppressive silence, the music. I went on to explain that I needed his help to get my father into a state mental hospital because he went gone insane. I put my hand over the receiver and asked Bonnie to peek into the other room to see if my father was on the extension. She said he was. I knew then I had been cut off. My father came back in the room and stared at me, cold and hard. The rest of the people, Lee, Bonnie, and the old woman, started to go to sleep. I felt tired and sleepy too. I felt fear because they were all going to go to sleep and I'd have to face him alone and I grew heavy with exhaustion."

The paper was on fire. I took out things I didn't want to burn. Then a rack of clothes, lots of them, were beside the fireplace. I told my mother, \"These are old and out of date. I think I'll throw them away.\" She was shocked. \"You could fix them up.\" I said, \"I hate to sew.\" She was more shocked and angry. \"Why didn't you tell me that when I was younger? Then I wouldn't have bought you material and stuff,\" (that I had asked for). I said, \"At that time I was trying to like it, but everything I sewed looked bad, seams were uneven, stitches were showing, zippers were uneven, etc.\" Lydia held up a mauve dress for a 1 yr old.

I don't want to go to the \"thing\" tonight. \"Maybe I'll go and take a nap and later we can go.\" She agrees. I go to the house. I'm in the kitchen and my cousin Darcy is upstairs. She screams and runs down to us. We go upstairs because we can't understand what she is telling us. She points to a bed covered with blankets and clothes. The electric blanket on top keeps sparking. She's frantic about that spark. \"It will start a fire.\" I calm her down and she leaves. I look at the dresser against the wall behind the bed and it's covered with clothes, things. I sigh because it will take a lot of work to put it all in order and pack it. I start downstairs and an old woman, the landlady, is at the bottom coming up to see what all the fuss is about. I talk to her as I descend. Then I notice a few people sitting around and standing in my living room. Now it's a cocktail party. Everyone has name tags. A balding man stops me and introduces himself and says,\"Hi.\" He knows Verna the librarian and he just wanted to say hi. He says something else but I don't hear it. I pretend I understand and nod hoping I made the right response. There are 3 or 4 couples on or near the couch. I go over there. A reddish-haired guy comes down the stairs playing detective. He's sleuthing for his birthday present. It is some family custom of my neighbors that are somehow in-law related to me. He finds a cardboard box with record albums in it, alphabetized with ABC indexes. He pulls one out and hands it to a woman, his mate. He says the name of it and shrugs and says, \"I'd give it a 9.\" She's a little put out at him. What if the giver of the present were around. They'll have hurt feelings. His name is Gary. Then the other couple's cardboard boxes appear on their laps and they do it also. I am there but not a real part of the group."

That could help me understand. They were hidden in the side corners of the mattress. Near the bed, I saw some old books from my childhood. I picked up \"Little Women\" and was glad to find it. Then I started ripping off a cloth rectangle \"label\" of the corner (side of the mattress). I felt in there. At first I thought, \"This is silly. There won't be anything there.\" I felt mattress stuffing. In the background, I sensed my mother. Then I found a letter, then some more letters, pads, and paper. I was so happy I had hidden them a long ago, and now I had them and they would help me. Then I went down to the swimming pool in M City. I walked well, no limp. I marveled at my cure. Still had limp muscles but felt I could fix them with a few days of exercise. I went into the women's dressing room. I knew I was going to see Darryl. I changed, a 1 piece black swim suit. I looked down at myself. My body was 37 years, breasts were sagging, etc., but still looking pretty good. I stepped to the door and showered. Then I felt my old anxieties well up and constrict my throat. I felt frozen. Then I smelled the strong odor of \"chloroform,\" no, \"chlorophyll,\" no, chlorine. I realized that was what was doing it. It had triggered an old memory. Then I felt O.K. I went in and marveled at how the swimming pool had changed. It was Olympic size, with lots of ladders and things to play on. I got in, marveling that it was easy now, that I was cured. I swam toward the deep end, not in excellent form, but O.K. 2 men were there from my old high school days. 1 was an old friend, the other was Darryl. He saw me. I smiled. He recognized me. His teeth were blackened out, some of them. He had changed too. He came over to me and the old feelings were there. We played in the water. We'd go underwater, laying one on top of the other and kiss. It felt good. We'd come up for air and roll over to reverse positions. Then I saw that newborn babies were being brought to their parents to have a snack and enjoy a swim with them. 1, dark haired, dark eyes, stared at me and I at him. I thought, \"Huh, how large their heads are.\" Then Darryl and I agree to meet after we get out of the swimming pool. I had by this time chosen to ignore this other guy. I \"gave him up.\" Then I'm back in the shower room, feeling happy and excited about meeting Darryl. Some of the \"girl\" cliques start asking me questions. I reminisce with them. I tell them an amusing story about Darryl. They invite me to go to a party at a nice house. I think maybe I'll go. I don't like them, but they are the \"in\" crowd. I think maybe I'll bring Darryl along. Somehow this is slightly shocking and I laugh to myself because it's fun."

I said, \"No, I don't want to,\" because I wanted him to care for me, or be caring and then the sex would be good. He looks like, \"Uh, oh. She wants to get married.\" and I said, \"No, it doesn't mean we'll be together forever, just that when we're together, I want to feel close, cared for.\" He agreed and so I agreed to go to his room. At first, I just give in. I was kind of angry and then I really want to. We went to his hotel suite, many rooms. He's a big star and it was between performances. Then, he really began caring for me and he said, \"Goodnight,\" and kissed me. He was going to take me home or let me go home. I say, \"Hum, that's sweet, but I'd really like to stay.\" He was glad. We then heard other people in another room. Kids were using the communal kitchen from the other apartment. He had a round piano, very pretty, in his room. It was a small room. Then, there were lots of people around us and we were in a living room. He was then feeding a baby baby food and I had nothing to do. I wandered around aimlessly. I then said, \"I can do that, let me.\" He didn't want me to do anything, because he cared for me. Then I had the bowl of baby food and I was feeding the baby, only then I realized I was feeding myself. I was a little embarrassed for being selfish. Then I went away. I then saw a bunch of Indian men. I went to them and said, \"Did you know that Indian men are more useful and important than white women?\" They were a little angry and then agree. I keep repeating that. Some women heard and also agree. Then I asked the Indian chief to teach me. He showed me an intricate way of holding a metal thing, like a wrench or a peace pipe.

If you could jump straight up and hit it with the end of your cane (or stick) 35 times, you won lots of money. I did it 33 times and a couple more for good measure. I was aware that that was pretty good physical activity for my ankle joints being in the condition they were. I took my note (a card with a hole punched in it), over to the bartender and asked for my money. I was proud of my accomplishment.

They were supposed to go be an ambassador that couldn't get anything right, walking into flags, etc., and bouncing off furniture. She'd taken a photo of each one lying down. The noses and lips were important in profile and in blue light. None of them were right. I laughingly said, \"Shall I try it?

She looked startled and then remembered. Her mind was on many things. She apologized and said, \"Well sorry, we haven't got time,\" and hoped I'd understand. I wanted the part but did understand and said, \"Oh sure, no problem.\" Then a group of the cast gathered around her on the stage. She was giving directions about the song.

He was lovingly looking at different rifles and talking about how neat to have one that felt right in his hands. I was annoyed at him. A rifle is a device to kill with, if necessary, a tool, not something to revere. I looked around at the rifles for women. They were .22's, light, worthless. I was disgusted.

I layed down beside him, being very careful not to touch him and ignore him. He was cold, rigid and ignoring me.

You never really looked at me.\" He was pathetic, weeping, clinging and angry at me. I muttered something about, \"I'll never listen to you men again.\" We started yelling at each other. Other men in the dorm got disgusted with us and left. I said, \"I wish you would understand and I wish you'd let me have more time with the girls. Do you know what they say to me during the summers? That daddy never listens, he never shows me he loves us. Do you know they don't want to go back to you? Someday, you'll lose them the same as you lost me.\" I was almost crying, I had hurt him and I didn't want to. I really wanted him to understand and he didn't. He clutched at my hand, his hands were white and pink spotted. I yanked away from him and left."

The railroad tracks were the only answer. But then I saw a train load of people on the tracks. I felt upset and annoyed. I couldn't let the plane land until I'd cleared the tracks. The people got off the train. They were insane, crazy, helpless people. I feel overwhelmed, sad. I wanted to get  rescued. I didn't want to die, but I can't just abandon these people in their need. I couldn't make the order that would kill them. I was annoyed. I thought, \"Maybe I will. To hell with them,\" but I couldn't."

They took my chair. I limped back to the table. People stared at me and couldn't understand my change. A coast guard man (like one in another state), decided he had to be in love with me, puppy love. He kept trying to kiss me. I kept him at arm's length. It was a struggle. He was persistent. Finally, I agreed to go with him to a dance or something. I went to a room to change my clothes. By that time, I didn't worry about my chair (before, the bar keep was around and wanted to help me get it). We went to the room. I put on 2 underslips, one is like the current style, long slit in front. The other is old fashioned, shorter, full body, skirt was even more old fashioned, shorter (1st slip, 1980, 2nd 1970, skirt 1960, pearls around neck, 1950). It looked funny, so I rearranged outfits so the slips didn't show. The ardent man had friends that at first teased him. They didn't like me. They peeked in and harassed me. Finally they accepted me. I was excited about the dance now. We got in car and drove. We got there. The man was having intense feelings. I was protecting myself and also warming myself on his feelings. I saw Will S. He had 2 babies. He was taking care of them. I came over and touched one. I asked permission to help and hold one. He was aloof. I said, \"Oh, you don't like people to touch them. You like a lot of space around you and yours. I think it is too much space.\" I was aware of my bravery in telling this man I admired that I thought he was personally wrong on this issue. He had a problem, just like real people, even more than mine. Then I went on. Mabel asked me a question about my book which was published recently. She was snide about making money. I really told her off. I said, \"You can bet your sweet ass I will make money.\" She raised her eyebrows in shock. She was up against a wall and I was in righteous anger and really yelling. I said, \"Ya, but I also did a good book. It will be helpful, it is good reading, etc.\""

I'll bet you think I'm taking this away from you to hurt you, but see, I'm filling the cup and it's fresh. Now, here's the water. That's the most important, isn't it?\" The water cup then partially collapsed and the water spilled onto the food, but it was still O.K., just a little messy. Then I got nervous. I watched as the monkey changed. It was supposed to be cute and sit on my shoulder and chitter and be furry and hug me. I had held the door partially open with my keys (on a little sandal shoe), but the monkey was tiny, like a spider with a long tail. Then it was a small snake. I got really scared. The snake was growing and it was going to eat me, or kill me. It grew and I fled the room. I was on a road/freeway. There were many cars. I was in one. We were all fleeing the snake. It was huge now. The freeway was choked with cars. There was road construction and dust was thick in the air. I heard the screams of the others being killed by the snake. I felt fear and a certainty that this was it. No escape. The snake would get me. I looked to my left. The snake was on a moving train, devouring it and the people on it. I veered to the right and got out of the car, I tried to make myself very small and tried to burrow into the ground. I was burying myself alive to escape the notice of the snake. I felt doomed.

I told them, \"Howard and the girls are at home.\" They'd probably like to visit (they are my neighbors). Then I tryed to get into the van, only it was a drawer that goes into a hospital bed.

He said, \"Watch out for policemen.\" I nearly bumped into the tail lights of other cars as I was watching for policemen. I then decided I could probably out run them and I hit the gas.

Nate kept being around me and I was nervous for fear that I would give away our relationship. Her mother watched us closely. It was hard to concentrate on what I was doing. Paulina got mad at me because I hadn't listened to her closely enough and she made smaller books. I said, \"But they are lovely. I thought that's the size you said.\" She was appeased. I kept writing addresses on cards. There was a homemade house (miniature) with mice and hamsters in it. There was no cage or screen, just the make of the front kept them in. One of the mice wore a red and white polka dot handkerchief on her head. I commented on the nice workmanship on the house. As I was doing the cards, the mom came to me and asked, \"Are you in love with Nate?\" I stammered and acted like righteous indignation. I said, \"See this house we're in? My Aunt and Uncle have lived here since before I was born.\" I pointed to the places I used to play. \"They've been remodeled haven't they?\" asked Nate. It was done up nicely. Where horses and crumbly barns used to be, now there was interior decorator \"house beautiful\" barns (stone) and lawns. I finished the cards and started to leave. I got my cards and their cards mixed up. I stopped, embarrassed. \"Oh, dear,\" I said, \"I forgot to separate them.\" I did that. Nate hovered near me all the time. At one point, he pinched my arm and I jumped and said, \"Don't touch me!\" I felt caught. The cards turned into a pile of clothes, the arms of things kept falling and I kept trying to contain the pile. I started walking back to my grandmother's house. I told Nate what she had asked me. I felt she liked me some. There were bramble bushes, gravel, a white goat that eyed my pile of clothes with interest. I struggled to get home. I was almost there. Some watchers commented on me. I had to step on top of tables to get to my destination."

I felt badly about the entertainment. I went down the stairs to the dressing room. I put on makeup and an evening dress. I got up there and sang my heart out. They liked it. It was classy. I came back out. The owner was gruff. He was ordering his help around in a mean way. They were pissed at him. There was a commotion at the door. Some blacks were crashing, and the whites got up to leave. It was riot city. I jumped up and said, \"Wait. We can all work it out.\" I ran to the stage. The men grabbed me and started to pick me up and carry me up the stairs. I pleaded, \"No please, don't! You'll hurt me!

I told the men to carry me to the stage and I'd introduce them to a nice blonde woman, \"Sandra,\" who was rich. They were surprised and then got nice and agreed. They got me up on stage.

I called the doctor. I had some trouble getting his name (Rexford), and trouble dialing the number. A secretary found the number for me. The man was scared and moaning, lying on the floor in front of the desk. The secretary left the room and then a girl came out of the closet and exhaled lots of smoke. She was almost caught smoking and had hidden. She thanked me for not squealing. I nodded. Then the doctor came on the line. I told him what had happened. The doctor was crying, distraught. I said, \"Is there anything I can do for him?\" The doctor said, \"Oh yes, there's lots you can do. Give him some milk.\" I looked around the room. I saw a glass of milk on the desk. I thought about giving him a breast, but I had no milk. I went back to the desk and got the milk. I talked to him as I went, soothingly. He said, \"I don't want any milk.\" I said, \"If you drink your milk, I'll give you a kiss, a French kiss after every gulp.\" He said, \"Then I'll drink a gallon.\" I then found a bottle of beer. I took that to him. I asked the doctor if beer was O.K. Maybe the beer, or my kisses, would be too much and he'd die. The doctor said, \"The beer is fine.\" I asked the man how old he was.

I wake up and realize the door was open and probably people had walked by and seen me asleep on the job. A man walked up to the door and asked to come in to speak to me. I was on a couch. I said, \"Come in,\" trying to be professional. I folded up the blanket and set it aside. I saw that the room was crowded with furniture, my desk, the couch, a school desk and a chair. The man spoke with an accent, Spanish I think. He seemed shy. I had difficulty understanding what he said. He said he was a representative of the telephone company and wanted to have an explanation of the MMPI. He showed me a letter that had a picture of people on it (drawn), and the statement 75%, one out of 4 makes us be this way (employers were complaining because their sick employees blamed them). I said, \"Ah.\" I asked him his name. He said, \"Don Juan Sanchos.\" I wanted to call him Paul. He had sad eyes. He seemed intense. I said, \"I'll have to ask my supervisor as this is privileged information. I think it will be all right.\" I stepped out of the office and into Dylan's office. I said, \"There's a rep from Ma Bell and he wants to see the MMPI manual. He seems legitimate. He wants to know about the 1 in 4 %'s.\" Dylan went to the counter to get the test. He said, \"Someone else wants to see it too. Shall you do it or I?\" \"I could do it. I've done it once and I have taken a class. But I'd like you to do it. I'll watch and learn more.\" He agreed. I went back to my office. One of the desks was now a bed. It was like a dorm room (3 beds). I told them what happened and that Dylan would tell us out in the hall. Don Juan and Paul started whispering and giggling. I sat on the bed with my long skirt flowing around me. I said, \"What is it?\" They say, \"Oh, nothing.\" I go to the bed directly opposite where they were sitting. Paul moved, so it was Don Juan and me. I adjust my skirt since as I plopped down on the bed. I had lost balance and fell back some, showing my feet and underslip. I giggled. I looked at Don Juan intently (counselor) and said, \"Something's on your mind. I won't start the MMPI until you tell me.\" I lean forward; we are very close. He's shy and whispered, so I lay my head on his arm to hear better. It was a very soft and intimate moment. Soft laughter bubbled inside me. He whispered, \"I'd like to ask you out on a date.\" I smiled and said (into his arm with a coy glance at his eyes), \"The sooner the better.\" We laughed. (Before, he'd mutter and I'd say, \"What,\" and he'd say, \"Oh, nothing,\" but I knew what he said. \"You didn't tell me you could walk\"). My wheelchair was parked over to the side of the room. We went out into the hall. Chairs were set up. A whole class was in there. The only place to sit was on the same chair with Don Juan. It felt nice. We watched and listened as Dylan explained the test. He started by saying, \"The mid-line in the eye is very important,\" and went up to a girl in the front row (she's shy). He examined her eye, nose to nose. It looked funny and we laughed (I remember having done these kinds of funny gestures in a skit). Later, I was going across campus (like L or University). I was thinking, \"Where would be the best place to park my van so I have the least amount of walking between classes. I have one class in the Math building, one in the Home EC building.\" I then went to the \"women's center office.\" Andrea was there. I told her of Don Juan. She said, \"He's been here before, you know.\" Then I remembered that a year ago, when I was sick and in the chair, he came asking for the same information. I shared that I thought he came back because he liked me and I proudly told how I had been able to speak out and tell him that I'd like to go out with him, and then I felt a little badly because I remembered that I was still being passive. I hadn't set up the details of when we'd go out. I had been indirect again and I felt sure he'd pursue it."

When I kicked my feet or assisted, I got water in my face. When I let George pull, I was fine. We went through a door (the back of the toilet stall that had been a wall). A general in the army came up to me. I noticed that my feet touched bottom; the water was chest high. He looked at me with respect and compassion. He said, \"After you get past this door, you probably won't remember much but that's for the best.\" His tone and face indicated I had been very heroic and had been through a difficult time. We swam along. He asked me what brand I smoked. I smiled. I said, \"Salems.\" He said, \"Oh, good.\" He had Salems and was so pleased he wouldn't have to offend me with a different brand. I noticed that the Salems he offered me were shorter. I said, \"Oh, well, that's O.K.\" We swam into a lobby. I saw a young \"Mickey Rooney\" movie star. He was full of ego, asking people in a seemingly offhand way if they thought he was a good actor. Then someone said to me, \"Have you seen the movie '2 soccors'?,\" a story of 2 women who heroically trained for a race, or to play the game of soccer. I saw the woman training, running straight up a tracked hill and the pain and the exhaustion on their faces. I admired their guts. Then I said, \"I didn't like the movie because the movie featured the trials and tribulations of Robert Redford (a grown up Mickey Rooney), and only indirectly told the story of these brave women.\" Real sexist. I then saw Robert Redford up in a plane. It was about to explode and then it did. He reached back and picked up something and fell out. I thought, \"Ugh, how awful to be falling to Earth and knowing that in a few seconds you'll be dead.\" A bunch of jet planes, with flames coming out of the after burners, saw him fall and turned in formation to get to him. I thought, \"How silly. So many of them and they can't do any good.\" He crashed. I saw the jet land and was amazed how fast they could land. Then I walked back to the restaurant and the dream cycled over again."

I remembered him saying, \"It was O.K., wasn't it?,\" (our past together). I said, \"Sure.\" I told him, \"It was lucky they had good doctors in this town. My appendix broke in E City and no one could fix it, so I had to come back to the old home town and they fixed it. That's why I happened to be at the matches.\" It was snowing outside the doors (the entire wall) was open. I asked if they could be shut. Darryl's mom asked pointedly if I wouldn't be leaving soon and maybe it'd be a bother to have to open them again. Darryl shut them. Then I went downstairs to get a couple of hamburgers to eat and realized it was 10 of 1 and I was late to pick up Paulina. I handed the raw hamburger patties with catsup on them to a woman and said, \"I'm late and have to go.

Her daughter would get sick and cause earthquakes or something if she didn't have her glasses on. I went in to the counselor meeting. Lucy was playing pool and all the counselors from the community college were there in a meeting. I stepped in front of Lucy to put the glasses on her. She peered at me. I put them on her. She said, \"Ah, you're Barb Sanders.\" The other counselors looked up at me (they were sitting), then she looked at all of them. \"Now,\" she said, \"You'll all have to say your names again so I'll know who you are.\" I saw Co-worker Tyler looking at me. I felt sad. I left the meeting. I felt like I'd lost my friends. I lamented to Claire, \"I could have been in that meeting with them all night and enjoyed them, but I can't now.

            "content": "Some man and I were chaperons or protectors of a group of adolescent children. We were in a jungle. There was a tribe out there in the jungle that was out to get us. I had 2 dogs to guard me wherever I went, a black one and a cream colored one. This man and I were very attracted to each other, in the throes of falling in love, but we were always involved with helping these kids. They were between us. Early one morning, I got up to take a bath on the porch. It was a rare moment of privacy. One of the adolescent boys woke up the man and suggested he take this opportunity to speak to me. He did. He approached me. We looked at each other. We were wearing bathrobes and mine was partially undone exposing parts of me in a seductive (innocent) way. I sprayed water on him from the hose and we laughed. He and I kissed. The dogs then got restless (not because of us but because they sensed danger from the jungle). The man and I were then captured by the enemy tribe (I never saw them), and taken away. Now we're in separate circles (like a hut, only there is no hut). I was naked, had long blonde hair I was tied up. I was eating food out of a dish like an animal. He snuck a message to me; it was written on computer print-out paper (the message was handwritten and in code). He started with \"Dear Naked Girl: Couldn't help but notice.\" It was a joke and I smiled. I then broke my bonds and was able to escape. I had a choice. I could assist him to break his bonds and we could escape together, or I could escape and send back help. He urged me to go on and I agreed reluctantly because I'd be likely to get caught again if I went back for him alone. I traveled through the jungle. It was rough. I made it back and rescued him by sending back reinforcements. Then, I was in an office with lots of window spaces. I was on the phone talking with some sales person. I kept asking for his product; he kept sending defective ones to me. I refused to accept it and then he sent me another and it was also defective and I refused it. Finally, I got angry. I told him firmly that not only will I not accept this shoddy treatment but I shall officially complain to his headquarters. He was pissed and left the phone. A woman secretary responded to me. She tiredly agreed but said it was probable it won't do any good. I noticed my evidence was fading away and I felt frustrated and wanted to give up the pursuit. Then, co-worker Tyler came into the office. He, Kathleen and I were to have a talk. Tyler and I walked up a long stair case and sat on the top (like thrones on a roller coaster ride). Then Kathleen came up the stairs. Someone said that she did a great job rescuing Tyler in the jungle single-handedly but now she should apologize to Tyler for undermining his male ego. Tyler looked relieved and said, \"Oh, good. I would really like that. It would help.\" I looked at him. I was surprised and sad because he was like all the rest and I thought he wasn't. Kathleen then approached slowly and ceremoniously. She bowed her head and said, \"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\" I stood up and said, \"I'm sorry but I simply can't handle this. I'm leaving.\" I felt badly because of what was happening (both the scene and my leaving). I walked down the long steps and went into my office. I shut all the doors and windows and started pacing. I felt suppressed, upset, sad, and angry. I wanted to go back to explain to them why I had left, but I thought it was futile. I wanted to pack up and leave, but that would be quitting. Kathleen walked in. She was very angry with me. She lectured me and said, \"Isn't it amazing how one little thing can put a stop to everything? And it's all over?\" I said, \"Wait, I want to explain.\" She snapped, \"Explain? Tyler was ready. He wanted to get close. He said you should give up Ellie's estate because you can't handle her. He said you should not have changed your name and should change it back.\" I said, \"He told you that?\" I was half annoyed and half wondering what it all meant about Tyler and me. \"Would he have told me that if I'd stayed?\" She said, \"You? No, He would have told Helen.\" I wondered who Helen was but sensed that it was someone like a wife he had. Kathleen slammed the door on me. I went to the bottom of the stairs and looked up. I saw Tyler talking to the man in the jungle. I wanted to go up and talk to straighten it out, but then I gave up. It was too overwhelming."

The thought \"incestuous relationship\" came to mind, but I dismissed it because it didn't feel sexual. It felt suffocating and cloying. He loved me so much that he needed to be near me all the time. He treated me like a child. I wanted to see a particular movie because of a good looking movie star. He refused to let me. He was jealous of my interest in this other man. I told him, \"Hey, I'm 21 years old.\" He looked hurt and scared. He sneered and said, \"If you see this man, I'll cut you off from my money. Ha! How will you support yourself?\" I felt confident, strong. I said, \"I have skills and talents.\" I listed some and added that I could type 70 words a minute and if I had to, I could be a clerk-typist. I wouldn't starve. I left him. I felt sad to leave him but I knew I must go to be free to grow. I traveled alot. I think I went to college. I was in a dorm room. A woman came in, young. She was going to help me and that would be a nice surprise for me, a gift. She was going to fix up my room. I hid in the closet. She talked to me even though she didn't know where I was. She came to the closet. She said, \"I'm going to sort your clothes and I'll mend any that have rips in them.\" I hid in my blue bathrobe in the middle of the rack. She started at one end. She picked up a dress. It was frilly and small, like for a young girl. She said, \"I don't know why you chose this dress. It was silly of you to do it. You could have had the other. It was better,\" (I think the other was a serviceable sweat shirt). I felt somewhat embarrassed and amazed that I had chosen the baby dress. She started telling me she was jealous of me because I could always do everything so well, and I always got everything she wanted. I felt badly for her. I came out of the closet to talk with her. Then I heard an awful buzzing. I looked at the window. There were giant bees that looked like chickens that had flown in the room. Their heads were in the room, but their bodies were still outside. They were dangerous. We got scared and decided to leave the room. As we got to the door, one got in. He flew out down the hall and I tried to shut the door and he flew back into the room and I got out of the room and tried to shut the door. The woman handed me a rifle. She said to kill it. It was a 3030 rifle. \"This is the only size gun that will kill it.\" I started to take aim. A man (perhaps Howard), was holding the bee (now a cute black puppy), so I could kill it. I told the man to get out of the way. If I missed, he'd get hurt. He laughed. He had total confidence in my ability. He would not move. I couldn't get him to, so I took careful aim. The gun was covered with papers and a screw was loose. I tightened it up. It was complex and difficult, but I got the gun fixed. I took careful aim at the head of the bee/puppy and fired. I got it. It slowly died. It was awful to see. Then I went down the hall. My \"father\" was there. He was semi-laying on a waiting room bench. He looked old and ill, a dazed look in his eyes. He caught my hand and begged me silently to listen to him. He kept asking, \"Why, why, couldn't I have loved that man? Why did I decide he wouldn't do for my daughter? Because of him, she left me.\" I soothed him and said, \"Hey, you can't love everybody. It's O.K.\" He looked tired and sad. I looked into his ears. A white milky substance was in them. I was examining him like a doctor. Another doctor (male), came up to watch. My father looked \"caught\" and said, \"Oh why are you here? I don't want you to know.\" The male doctor picked him up to take him to the hospital. He had had a stroke and couldn't make his legs work. As he was being taken away, a cart with many beautiful things from all different foreign countries was coming down the hall for him. They were gifts from his daughter who was returning from his (her?) many travels to see him. Funeral or mystery music followed the cart."

He is caressing those pillows tentatively like he'd like to remove them and touch me but isn't sure of himself in terms of how I would react. I am emotionally somewhat removed and just watching him."

Someone named Mitzy gets squished a little and I ask her if she's all right. I have to go teach a class. Somehow, everyone has found out about the affair and I'm embarrassed. I decide to cancel my class, so at 3:00, I won't have to meet Pedro. However, I had ordered some books and they had just come in. Paulina and I go to the gym to get the books. The gym is in the same building as my class, so I sort of sneak in. I ask directions. I find it. I start looking for my sack of books. I see some needlepoint and I think it's mine. A lady comes up to me and asks how she can buy the books. I say, \"Oh no, these are ordered. If you take some books you are taking them away from others.\" \"Oh,\" she says, \"I didn't know.\" Paulina and I leave. There is a big vicious dog, a German Shepherd with teeth barred. We run and get into the van so he can't get us. Some man in the van laughs and says, \"Ha! So you think he's vicious, huh? I can handle him.\" He opens the door. I plead with him not to. He goes out there. I'm afraid. I shut the door so he can't get me and Paulina (the dog). I notice the keys are in the ignition and I feel a little safer. Pedro is with us now. Then a lady says she's going out there. The dog's been tamed. I plead with her. She goes. I hear the dog attack her, and rip her to shreds. Later, the coast seems clear, so Paulina and I scramble out of the van and into the building for safety."

As I'm fixing it, word comes to me that a General has ordered one of my special breads, so I weave the loaves together and cook it. It is beautiful. I cut it open. There are interwoven tunnels in the white, feathery, textured bread. I pour melted butter down the tunnels. I am impressed with my own cleverness. I decide to carry it to the General myself. I am wearing a long silk, white evening gown. I am older (late 40's, early 50's), but looking good. I walk through the messy, busy kitchen. At the next room is the transition room from the kitchen to the fancy restaurant. I take off the apron and trade the wooden board for a silver tray with fancy napkins on it. I walk out into the restaurant. I ask, \"What table?\" It's either 21 or 12, I'm not sure. I go into a private room, lots of drunken people. As I look for the table, I'm thinking, \"I hope I can find the table. Don't be silly, you own the place, you know where everything is.\" I find the General and start to place the bread in front of him.

I'm also angry that my father is playing it so loud. Valerie, my sister-in-law, comes in to talk. We are looking at the same things on the bed, like Christmas gifts I made or something. We're talking. Then the football game is off but some T.V. program is on. I say, \"Who's watching T.V.?\" Valerie says, \"Ellie.\" I say, \"Oh ho. Send her in.\" Then I yell, \"Hey Ellie, come here a minute!\" She says, \"No.\" I say, \"Ya. I want to talk to you. Turn that thing off. It's too loud and it will wake grandma.\" She says, \"No, it won't.\" My father is listening to the football game in their bedroom on the radio. Paulina wanders through. I'm talking about swimming. Oh, earlier I had dreamt that I was invited to go swimming at Peter M's house (he's a para, a student at the community college). He, his wife, and I were swimming in a small \"hot tub\" swimming pool in his backyard. There's some connection between his wife and Valerie, like they are the same woman. I think I was embarrassed because I could get up and walk and he couldn't, like he'd resent me or something. Anyway, I look at Ellie (I'm back in the bedroom in M City). One arm looks longer than the other, longer than mine, even. I say, \"Come here. Let me feel your arm.\" She smiles, self-consciously and reluctantly comes over. I turn so I'm in front of her. I lay her left arm next to my left arm. It is quite longer than mine. I'm amazed. I call Valerie over to look. I then ask Ellie to reach both her arms out in front of her. She does so reluctantly. It's hard for her to move the right one. The left one is huge. The hand is huge. Then I push back the sleeve of her left arm and feel it. I am horrified to discover she has 2 elbows. There are some wrinkles, old age skin, and scars. Ginny and her son Ricardo come in with my mail from the P.O. box in M City. Someone says, \"How nice. She picked up your mail.\" I say to her, \"How can I have not noticed all these years that she has 2 elbows?\" there is a sense of astonishment tinged with guilt and some distress because she's disabled now, but I'm not too worried about that. I am aware that she wanted to be unique in some way and has chosen this way. I look at the mail. There are 2 statements from the M City branch bank and a wooden board from the community college Performing arts with art work (3-d) on it, ceramic statues, carved wood, etc. I feel somewhat honored that I am considered part of the community college Performing Arts department. I guess I'm an honorary member. It's an election for officers. Directions are on the board. George and Greg are 2 names I could read. I have to lift up blocks of wood beside the name I am to vote for. I think, \"George? He works for me. Oh, it must be a different George.\""

A long line of cats in a catalogue. Each has a special shampoo for them. First, a white Persian gets a banana shampoo, then a gray cat gets a green one, and on down the line. Now they are real and one reaches out his paws and hugs the next cat's head, his green shampoo gets on the other one. Then my teen age boy/me says, \"What next?,\" and opens the door to the other bathroom (I think I was just observing this). A young boy is in there. The boy/me says, \"Well, heavens, when I was your age, I was in the bathroom a lot too, but not with a girl,\" as he sees a young girl.

He's new to the family. I adopted him.\" Just then, we hear him upstairs crying out, \"Stop it Yerg, stop it!\" The boy goes upstairs and I follow. Lots of kids are up there.

I was going to trade them in for new things but was a little peeved at myself for my ridiculousness because all you can trade in used metal things for in a used metal store is different used metal things. Then my acting class and I were in my house. Ethan was talking to us over the phone. He said that he was sorry he couldn't be there to teach the class today, but we should all go to the library to get articles from 1950's magazines. It would teach us a good acting lesson. I was pleased. I'd done this before and it was fun to look back at that era. I went. We all came back to my house. I had a bunch of magazines, Good Housekeeping, etc. Then they were record albums. I put one on; the Gee-Gee Brothers. Ethan then came into the house. I was wearing a robe that kept slipping open. I kept trying to re-tie the sash and I held it tightly around me. Ethan watched dispassionately. He again apologized for being busy and unable to be there for class. I said, \"Oh, it's fine because I liked the assignment. In fact I've done it once before, a sociological project. I took sociology before psychology.\" Then he said, \"And what did you learn?\" I pulled my robe tighter around me and noticed with annoyance I kept doing that. I went to go change the long playing 50's record for another. When I came back, Ethan was sweating and his shirt was wet with perspiration. He had it half off. I sat on the couch. Other students were wandering around. Ethan half laid on the arm of the couch, watching me intently. Like a teacher, with some slight care in his face, he had a message to impart and he wanted to be gentle (for him). I said, \"About my acting...\" He said, \"Next term, I want you to work on characters unlike yourself, reach out, expand, use bigger gestures.\" I said, \"You know, in my acting final, you saw that, yes? Well, I kept laughing. You broke me up, I broke me up, my partner broke me up.\" He frowned. I said, \"I know, you see, I'm good at comedy. I've always done little skits that I write and then act in.\" I was sort of bragging, hoping he'd notice my creativity. He was dead pan. I went on, \"And so I act me. I have good comedic timing. Now I need to learn to really act.\" He nodded. He suggested I practice saying a sentence that ends in all right...all right (someone's name), to get the inflections all right. Then he looked up. Someone was coming in the door. \"Oh,\" he said pulling his shirt back on (it was his wife). \"I had better straighten up here.\" It was a joke. Then 2 delivery boys came to the door. The first one handed me a package, books I had ordered. The second one ran around him and shoved his package into my hands ahead of #1 boy. #1 boy was amazed, so I took the first package that was put in my hands. It was my new checks from the bank. #1 boy left, upset. I looked at him wondering if he expected a tip. He just grimaced and left. I opened the checks. I saw my picture on the check, like my master's degree student days, with long frizzy hair. I was surprised, they had updated the picture. Then as I looked, each picture on each check was different. They looked awful. In one, I was playfully kissing Cory. A woman stood outside, looking in the window. She said something. I didn't hear her and said, \"Huh?\" She repeated. \"Ya, I saw them too, they are pretty funny looking.\""

I look in the mirror and like what I see. I decide to stay in costume for when Desmond comes over. It's later in the evening and I've been in the costume for many hours.

I think I should clean if off (shit). It's behind me as I stand at the sink. Every time I bend over to the sink, my dress brushes on the messy part. I get annoyed. The light bulbs are getting dim. I turn and pull a chain on one fixture. A small bulb barely lights up the place. I turn to the double sink and turn on the water, and scrub my face with soap and water. Most of the blue is gone and some of the red is smeared. I feel like I'm in a hurry to look pretty. The light bulb goes out. I see the sinks have overflowed onto the floor. I'm standing barefoot on soggy carpet with water to mid-calf. I pull the plug and all the water goes away. I look in the mirror again and pull many clips from my long hair which kept my hair up under my fancy hat. Now, it's nearly totally dark. I go from one light fixture to another, pulling their chains but all the bulbs are blown. I think, \"I could go get new lightbulbs.\" They are in the closet but I can't seem to find the closet. I feel closed in by the dark. I grab my hat, put it back on, leave the room, remember my earrings, and decide not to go back to get them. I go to the bedroom (unused), and look in the mirror, then into bathroom #1. There are some Xmas cards taped to the door."

A woman, older (a Lady XXX type, a sad woman I knew in XXX who was lonely and threatened suicide), came by and threatened suicide. Some of my family decided to stay to help her. Then, I was on the road, driving. I looked up to see part of my family in a truck, semi-crashed across the road, but everyone was O.K. I went on down the road and saw Lady XXX's beat up old van/housetrailer crashed into a bank. She was O.K. She was a bit sheepish and stubborn. I thought that she had tried to die. I was annoyed at her because it was causing trouble for my family. I looked up, and across the street was a huge home-made camper, a complete house for a large family on wheels including a back porch. I was laying down in the back of Lady XXX's van with Lady XXX comforting her. I started to go to my family but Lady XXX holds on to me. She didn't want me to leave her. I looked out the window again and saw my teen-age \"brothers and sisters\" out for a walk to stretch their legs. Some younger ones opened the van and crawled in. I decided to join my family. I got out, against Lady XXX's protests. I was driven across the street by a brother, a younger brother. I was surprised he knew how to drive. He asked which entrance I wanted to use to get into the camper. He says, \"It doesn't matter which.\" The back entrance had 4 steps. The front entrance had a huge flight of stairs first going up and then down, with a landing or two here and there. I said indignantly, \"It does too matter. I'm not walking all those steps.\" I went to the back and got in. Now it was just a big, crowded van. My \"brother\" was talking as he was driving and not paying attention. He let some of the wheels go over the edge of a cliff that went straight down to the sea. He looked at my \"dad\" and was horrified. My father waited to see if he would wake up. I was horrified because we were all going to crash to our death. The van slid slowly over the edge and stopped. I knew if anyone moved, it would then continue sliding to the sea and then, death. I decided to save myself. I decided I'd crawl over bodies of my family if necessary but I'd save myself. I started to carefully crawl up and out. A 1 year old baby was caught upside down near me. I grasped the edge of the cliff. Then, I just couldn't leave her, so I reached down and grabbed the baby and threw her up to safety. I felt scared and sad. I scrambled up to the road edge and started grabbing any babies or people around, to assist them. The van tumbled half-way down the cliff. People and things were scattered all over. I saw \"dad\" half-way down and I yelled, \"Dad, dad, dad!\" I say, \"Here, reach up, I can pull you up.\" He looked at me sadly. I felt fear that he was too big and would pull me back over. I was also afraid he wouldn't try to reach up to me. I got a blanket and leaned it over the edge to reach him. Other people reached out to me (one of them, Oriental). I pulled them up to safety as my father refused to be helped. I felt sad. All the rest that could be saved were. My father decided to try. I then saw that part of one leg was missing. He crawled up to the edge and someone else and I helped him over the edge. We were near the edge. I was crouched near him, comforting him. I said, \"Are you O.K.?\" He said he thought one leg was broken and the other one gone partly. A young man, a violinist, came over. He was the anesthesiologist. He started to play. My father got quite upset and told him to go away. He was distressed and tried to explain how his music would help take away the pain. A second violinist was called in, a young woman with a very ornate violin. I looked up at her and explained that dad wouldn't listen. I defended his position. I said, \"Look, how would you like it if you had to listen to violins all day at work (my father's a music teacher), and then come home to your family and hear violins (I played for 5 years and my mother played too), you'd be sick of it too.\" I used a second analogy but I don't remember it."

A girl in class asks if the cleaning of a wig can be done for free. She says a friend of hers has 2 wigs that are soiled and she brings out a letter to read, written by the girl. She is in tears because she realizes that she shouldn't read this private letter in front of the class. I start to leave (after Ethan lectures about acting technique, looking at me as he talks). I get my red coat on and start to pick up my packages. Ethan comes over.

I pick up his Xmas present to me and open it. It is body paints. He laughs and opens them and starts to paint my face and he starts with the yellow and white. We're somehow in a moving car, but neither of us are driving, or maybe Ethan is and doesn't have to look at the road often. He gets some of the paint in my mouth. It tastes funny. He says, \"Don't worry, it's not toxic.\" I spit it out in a hanky anyway. We laugh. I have become his mistress, as he is married."

A man (my husband) said, \"Why not wrap it around your body and go take a steam bath.\" I looked at him and said, \"What a good idea.\" I wrapped it around me and wrapped a towel around it to cover it.

I was agitated because I didn't want to get caught.

Just as I finished writing my name, the woman got out of that steam bath and I got in. Then I got scared. It was metal with a shower-like nozzle near my face. I was afraid I'd hurt myself and the steam would be too hot and burn me, so I carefully read the instructions. I was just about to turn it on when the door opened and a woman came in with 2 men (plain-clothed cops). I felt like I'd been caught. I had been wondering how to get back to my cell because the towel would be wet too but I had to keep the sheepskin covered. They started to question me. One said, \"Well, Gretchen\" and I got indignant. \"I'm not Gretchen.\" I played out my limp and sat down, explaining I had R.A. I knew I was faking it. It worked, and they left. I then went back to my room/cell. It was damp from the steam bath. It was time to escape/leave. I did so. Then, I was rich, dressed in a suit and high heels, golden earrings with jewels on my ankles. I was looking down busy city streets. I go to a store where Thea and Jared work. I bought a pin the shape of a bird or turtle that I knew Jared loved. I decided not to give anything to Thea. I then walked on down the street to another shop where Jared was working. I gave him the pin. He was overcome by my kindness. He hugged me a lot. I felt his pot belly and his flaccid penis. I started to feel like it was time to move on. I walked, and then I noticed I was in a bad neighborhood. I felt a little nervous. I was walking toward a busy street where I could get a bus or a taxi. A man walked up to me and started to harass me. He was going to rape me. I got angry. At first, I warned him to leave me alone. He grabbed me and in one swift and powerful kick to his groin, I got him. He fell to the ground, groaning. I kept on walking. I walked past a newsstand. A couple of leather jacket types started to verbally harass me. I told them to watch out, because I'd protected myself before and I'd do it again. A 3rd man said, \"Ya, she's right. Leave her alone.\" I walked on. I went into a cafe to call a taxi. I think I was crying. A taxi driver there said \"Hey, where do you want to go?\" I said, \"Are you a taxi driver?\" He said, \"Ya.\" I said, \"Let's go.\" I feel rescued."

They were not too thrilled with my ho-hum hamburger gravy and potatoes and openly snickered at my skits. I took a cat in my arms and the cat and I walked up close to each of my relatives (black and white adult cat). They were all sitting in a semi-circle. I held the cat up to the face of each one. The cat bit cousin Willie real hard. I told the cat not to bite anymore. He just looked at me. My Grandpa Lloyd and Grandma Mildred were having an \"argument,\" much like my parents. Grandpa took a big sweet dessert and ate it. I ate a spoonful of sweet chocolate, wondering why I did it because it wasn't good for me. Grandma nagged at him, ever so sweetly. \"Now Lloyd, look at that. You know better than to...etc.\" Lloyd just glared at her and ate more. They were like children deliberately getting on each other's nerves. Ginny, my Aunt Millie, Bonnie and I got into a car to go to a fair for the disabled. I was angry because I realized that I only had a bicycle with flat tires to assist me when I got to the fair and I was going to get tired and achy walking around. We had trouble getting there. When we got there, a car was backing out into traffic. One wheel got caught on the curb and the whole car turned over. A woman driver was in it. I kept wondering how she managed to flip the car and if she was all right. Another car, trying to get into the parking lot, just pushed her around. She finally got out. I then started making a list of all the supposed things being done for the disabled and discovering it wasn't helping the disabled. It was helping the establishment feel good about helping the disabled. I wrote these down so I could expose this. I saw Marv C with a bandage on his thumb. We hugged. He said, \"It was so kind of you to like my things.\" His things were beautifully calligraphied posters in blue ink. I then picked it up and looked closely. I said, \"It is pretty and quite nice, but did the disabled make them? How are they helping the disabled?\" I put him on my list. I also put the Iron Duchess on my list."

People are cool. My brother and I live with step-parents that don't care about us. We come home from school. My watch is broken or was broken by kids at school. My \"step-mother\" is very uncaring. It's late at night. We decide to go to the other universe. My brother has already tried it and says that it is better than where we are. I follow him to his bedroom. I have a \"younger sister\" with me. We sneak in being very quiet so we don't wake up \"younger brother\" or \"step-mother.\" My brother lies on the bed. I stand up on the bed, my feet under his back. I keep almost losing my balance. The \"younger sister\" (Paulina), stands on the side of him, holding very hard. We set the dials. At first, nothing happens. Then I get worried something will go wrong. Then a part of the watch shines red and the scene changes and then the scene is the same. A woman comes in. It's my \"step-mother.\" At first, it is Claire K (a client) and then my Aunt Naomi. She offers me soda and cookies. At first I won't eat them because they have sugar and then I do. She is talking to me, making comments that give me information about the situation on this planet or universe. I carefully don't answer questions. She says she is going away. She tells me there is a package on the porch for me. She is friendly and nice. She talks about men. We agree that they are messy. I say, \"Look at the bottom of that river.\" I see a river with garbage and debris on the bottom. \"I sure didn't put that there. You didn't. Men did.\" Now I'm on a boat. We are about to cross the harbor. The man at the helm says, \"They've dug out the harbor here and as such now two way traffic can now get through.\" He says, \"You'll find it much changed.\" I look and realize that it's a lot of traffic like New York City harbor. I see wooden boats that look like whales on the bank. He says, \"Here we go,\" and suddenly the boat flies up over some apartment buildings and over the watery expanse between the buildings. I expect the boat to drop down, fly up and drop down again, but we fly smoothly. My younger sister holds my hand."

They were there to learn how to enjoy the wilderness as I had learned to do. I told them to close their eyes and think of their favorite food. Then I told them to think of all the ways they could cook it, sauteed, boiled, etc. Then they needed to cut it into little squares and carry it in a backpack. Then they were to pair up. One put on a blindfold, the other lead and then later they switched. I then got a chalk. At first, I start to ask for one, and then I looked for it myself. I draw dotted lines with arrows around leading up to hopscotch games on the playground (school). The starting place was an old tree. As I was making my marks, I came up to a class counter with china in it. I see a teapot that looked like it went with an old tea cup I own. I asked this guy for it.

There are lots of pianos, pretty little ones, antiques, huge mirrors, and a leather flat bag. I start to look in it and think, \"I don't want to see what's in here.\" I look anyway. A baby or a cat is in there. It looks at me and glares. I cover it back up. Then I'm at a dance with lots of guys. Then I'm back at the apartment, looking for a room for my bedroom. I knock on a door and say, \"I'm coming in.\" A guy is in there. He's upset. It's his room. I apologize. I've walked into someone else's apartment. This woman and I keep going to other rooms. I'm holding the cat now. I'm in an evening dress. The woman and I find a room. There are gays in there. She lies down. The cat is upset and runs away. I lie down beside her. Her husband, latin or black, holding their baby, stumbles in drunk and lays down on the other side of her. She is annoyed with him. I have a feeling we're going to make love and I feel scared.

The stairs have been messed up by Fletcher's chair rides. The carpet is rumpled and some stairs are long or missing, making the walking uneven. I look for a bathroom. I see two doors. The name plaques are Italian, and lots of decals and graffiti are on doors. One said \"terrier ricotta,\" or something like that. I stop a young kid (early 20's), janitor, and ask him, \"Which one's the women's room?\" I feel annoyed. I think I'm in the performing arts class area because the Italian words are from opera class. He can't remember so he sticks his head in one of the doors. A woman comes out. She says she knows it's the women's room because she did the sigh change. I thank both and go in. The room is a mess. There are toilets all around, but no stalls. I sit on one, the most protected from view. As I bare my ass, a guy comes in. I'm really annoyed and I stand up, covering myself. Then I sit down again and discreetly try to cover myself. He mutters some apology. He's looking for something. My mother/older lady is upset and insulted. He drops his white cane as he backs out. The I pick up a life magazine and see an article on Elizabeth Taylor. The picture moves; it's a movie. The narration talks about how expressive and white her hands are. She has been in an accident and is a para. Her hands are lovely but are nervously clenching and unclenching one another. I get up and go back to bed. I want to make sure all the doors are locked. Something is making me nervous. Then Elizabeth appears in my room. She's upset and wants to explain to me about the \"Life\" story, something about a lost baby. We go back downstairs.

I look for rough surfaces to slow me down. I find my house. There are lots of people on the front lawn. I join them. It's a meeting. Ethan is the leader. I listen, then decide it's time to act. I raise my hand and say, \"May I have permission to write 'Dear Friends and Colleagues',\" a P.R. letter about the play. He agrees. The others are amazed at my braveness. I had a job to do and I did it."

I feel afraid because I am inadequately defended. He and I circle each other and then we start to laugh at the silliness of the situation. We agree to be blood brothers. He cuts his thumb with his knife and I cut mine with my knife and we mix the blood. Then we talk about how we can work together.

I lead them to a spot of grass where I have marked their tires and engine number. They pull up there. I have a banquet table set up for them. Then I see a national hero. He's driving a tank in the water. I go near to see and get caught under the tank treads. I become invisible so I won't be hurt.

He says he used to work for an ambulance and therefore was embarrassed to use it. He looks for a place to park. I realize I'm in his parking space but don't move. A car in front of me leaves and he parks there."

Then on my way to school, I wake up again to discover that I had been crawling on my belly to school sound asleep. I hear a Dixieland Jazz band with a good thumping bass. I look up and see dial-a-bus drivers marching down the street like a parade. I hear Herman saying that he can play good bass and if they'd liven up the music, he'd play for them. They politely smile and keep on going. He's too hippie for them. I look at my watch and I see that it is 3:20 a.m. No wonder I'm so sleepy! I can't believe it. Here I am at the entrance to school, not dressed (in my pj's). I see others dressed and going to class so I figure my watch must be wrong. I look at a clock at the school. It says 4:00 a.m. I think, \"How weird. Usually it's 3:30 or 4:00 p.m. when I go home and here I am going to school at the same time only a.m.\" I go down the hall. A girl (Anita) goes by. I ask her the time. She says, \"ll:00.\" Now I'm late and have missed my first class and a half! I feel confused and silly. I tell her what I had done. We go into the bathroom. I decide to take a bath. I get in the bathtub and realize that I had not bothered to take my clothes off! I had started to pull my jeans down but there I am, shoes and all soaking wet. I am amazed at myself and call Anita over and exclaim, \"I'm so sleepy I didn't even take my clothes off. Now how am I going to go to class? I don't have any other clothes.\" She says, \"Don't worry. There's always some clothes laying around in a suit case. We'll find something.\" Then I see some dresses and shirts of mine and I say, \"Oh ya, I forgot. Here's some of my clothes I've left here before.\" I feel embarrassed because if I'd been thinking clearly, I'd have known that and she wouldn't be helping me. I'm still standing in the bathtub. I pull the plug to let the water drain. I see that I've had a bowel movement and I'm embarrassed. A laundry basket with clothes and towels is in the tub with me. I'm still standing. I'm tired of standing and I resent the fact that I didn't get to take a relaxing bath. I start to fold clothes. Anita is helping me. She sees the bowel movement and looks embarrassed. She says, \"Don't worry, I'll clean it up,\" but I can see she doesn't want to. I say, \"No, I'll do it.\" I scoop it out into the toilet and see french fries and fish sticks floating around also. I scoop them out too. I'm glad I took care of it myself and didn't let her do it for me (Anita sometimes reminds me of mother and sometimes reminds me of me.)"

He's not the only \"genius\" or genus species to cry. I'm trying to trace the leg of Donald Duck and I need to connect Route 66 with Centennial Blvd. I make a mis-tracing, but then I figure it out."

I resent having to do things the way the dad dictates. Dad apparently told Dwight and Dwight told me. A younger sister questioned if she could go to store to get milk and we all gasp at her because dad would be angry if he heard her innocently talk about buying impulsively. One waits for sales and buys in weekly or monthly lots to save money. I open a drawer. I find lots and lots of spaghetti noodles. I am going to peel potatoes and look for some fresh potatoes. All I find are rotten old ones. I feel angry and resentful. I look out the window. I see a lighthouse. It is short and fat. I say, \"Oh, has it the old lantern in it?\" I then laugh and answer myself, \"Probably not. They aren't used anywhere any more. It's a shame.\" Some man is watching us. I plop the dishes on the table, 3 plates. One for dad, one for Lydia, and one for myself. We sit at a huge table. Dwight sits where dad should be. I look startled and then see he's sitting next to dad's place. My plate is accidently too close to dad's plate. I get angry and grab it and move it to my place. The man watches. It's like I'm temperamental and capable of standing up to this dad and he's curious if I'm going to blow up or if I'll just keep all that resentment inside. I feel fake nonchalance.

It's all gone. But I got this one because it's like your candle and I liked it.\" I am embarrassed because I am indirectly telling him I like him. He starts talking about the old days, when we were together. I feel drawn to him. It's very sensual. He says, \"I smell something burning.\" I look. There are 3 candles burning. One, his candle, is near something and I go over to look. A plant is too close to the candle, and a bud is on fire. I pull it away and put out the flame. Most of the plant falls off. I exclaim, \"Look how it's grown. I got this plant this evening. It just had a few shoots and now there are long shoots and 2 or 3 buds.\" I feel sad that it's burnt and broken, but I feel O.K. because it grows fast and will regrow new buds.

I am really stubborn. I want to walk it. I'm in the fast lane walking, and I decide to go on the side of the road so cars won't run over me. I look over my shoulder several times to see if cars are coming, and then I get on the side of the road. I'm walking fast and I'm hugging the side of the road so I won't get run over. I walk on wooden boards that are attached to chicken houses. It gets real narrow. I have to watch my footing. The chickens are mean. Some bite and I get scared. As I squeeze through near the ones that bite, I whimper and say, \"Don't bite.\" They do a little but I get by. Now I'm on a second story level. I have to move a row of black animals to get to the edge to jump off to get back on the road. I pick up a puppy, a cat, a chicken, etc. and move them. A boy in a cage sees what I'm doing and verbally gives me encouragement. I feel an urgency to escape. I hop down and land in a dishwasher. I try to be quiet. For some reason that puzzles me. I pick up 4 plates, a sugar bowl and its lid. They are white and purple Melmac just like the set I had when I first married. I pick up a towel with holes to cover it up and I start walking. The young, angry, unhappy wife suspects I've taken her dishes and starts to follow me. I try to hide the dishes in the towel but they are awkward and keep slipping and showing through the hole. She gets in her car and tells her husband she's going to follow me to get to the bottom of this. He gently tries to dissuade her. He's on my side. She says, \"No,\" and comes after me. He tells her as an aside that I'm usually in a wheelchair. She doesn't believe it. She asks me belligerently, \"Are you usually in a wheelchair?\" I say, \"Yes, it's in M City. I'm walking to M City where I can pick up my van with a lift and my wheelchair.\" She is sitting on a chair mounted on the hood of the car and contemptuously offers me a ride to my van. I get stubborn. I don't want to be near her because she'll see the dishes and ask about them. For some reason it's important to walk to M City. I tell her, \"I want to walk.\" I do. She's really angry and follows me. Her kind and patient husband comes along. I am stopped at a swimming pool along the road. All persons must swim before they are allowed through this small town and pay the price of admission. I am annoyed. Captain James T. Kirk is the mayor. I tell him, \"I can't swim.\" He says, \"No problem, just wade barefoot in a small pool and I'll let you go on.\" I clutch my dishes which rattle and keep slipping. I look at the pool. The incline to get to the pool is long and steep. I snort indignantly that I can't walk that steep an incline because of my ankles. He thinks for a moment. He says, \"There is another alternative,\" and goes to his book of city ordinances. It is thick and has tabs with city ordinance #'s. When he opens it up to the one he wants, I look over his shoulder and see it's handwritten and the only one there. He obviously writes the rules as he sees fit, a very shady operation. He sees that the alternative is to go to a meeting of the Ladies Mayhem Society. l The dues are $50. I only have to pay $45 on account of I've already paid $5 for the swimming ticket. I prudently agree. I know I'm being cheated but I want out of there to get away from that angry wife and to get to M City, back on my journey. I think about dumping the dishes but I stubbornly refuse even though I'd be more comfortable without them. I have no use for them anyway. I go on. She follows me. The husband gives me a nice towel with no holes to better conceal the dishes."

I look up and see Uncle Lionel glaring at me. Other male relatives are sitting in a semi-circle. I still tell the truth but make it sound nicer. Instead of using a tone of voice that is putting her down, I speak softly and loving about how she was just brought up to believe a woman's place is in the home and taught Terence that women are supposed to be in the home. I say, \"He won't change.\" She (Ginny), agrees. I follow her down the sidewalk; her two sons are with her. I think, \"They are Ernie's boys.

We can't seem to fly and I almost give up, but lots of men are around and they are an ugly crowd. Now there are 3 of us women trying to fly away. We make a gigantic effort and we start flying. At first, we're as high as the wires and stop and duck that. Then we hit some updraft and flow up into the sky. Soon we are smoothly gliding up and up and don't have to flap our arms. I am concerned because they can shoot at us, so we go as high and as far as we can. We realize that we'll have to hide now. We look for a mountain cabin. We find one. It's a motel. We have no money, no food. We think about ways we can get money. We decide the only way is to be prostitutes. We lure 3 guys in 3 cars to us. I have 3 men in my car, 2 standing and one laying down in the trunk. I sit on top of him. I'm so good that he has orgasm in just a few seconds. I feel a sense of accomplishment. I'm a good prostitute. One of the guys standing hands me $15. I say, \"No, I said $50 to $100.\" He says, \"Take it or leave it sister,\" and sneers. I feel calm. I stand up and put my hands on my hips like Wonder Woman and use my mind power. Their wallets float to me. They look flabbergasted. I smile. I look over at the other two cars. They have done the same. We have lots of money now and we fly away. We go to a mountain resort. We figure we're safe if we go in and register separately as no one knows what we really look like and our wings don't show. The third woman is a platinum blonde. We meet in the restaurant and \"make acquaintance.\" I am looking forward to when we can go to the hotel room where we can be ourselves and not play act."

I mean, how many people have pictures taken of themselves making love? It would look suspicious.\" I call out to Jamie. He's in another room. He says, \"Make yourself comfortable. Be with you in a minute.\" I decide I'm tired and look for the bedroom. I find his bedroom. It's lovely, a large king size bed, and a lovely window with a view. It's a nice apartment, so I unpack a few things. I put Muffin Cat down. I put my dream book and ink pen down (that writes blue and that I got at the conference in October). I put on my nighty (the maroon one), and get in bed. As I get comfortable, I begin to feel unsure. \"Maybe he didn't want me in his bed. Maybe he has a second bedroom.

Just tell me what you had in mind.\" He says, \"Ah, actually I'd rather you sleep in the other room.\" I say, O.K.\" I'm a little embarrassed but I feel O.K. about it. I then remember my dream book. I pick up the ink pen and look for the book. I would be embarrassed if he found it, especially if he read about the homosexual worries. I find it in the covers, near him. I pick it up and then gather my few clothes etc., and Muffin Cat. I follow him out the corridor. He points to a room. He has a funny smile on his face, like he's playing a mean joke. I go into the room to find myself in a huge dormitory ward, like destitute people in a hospital ward. A woman greets me. I see all these poor people and smell the hospital. I say to the woman, \"There's a mistake. I won't sleep in here,\" and I go back to the door. I see Jamie in his bathrobe, sheepishly waiting for me. I say, \"Very funny.\" We walk down the corridor. It's the outside of the apartment complex. To the left are stairs to apartment doors. To the right is a huge swimming pool. The outdoor safe tables, round and metal, are also in the pool, under water. I look at the pool and think, \"How nice. After I get moved in, I'd like to swim.\" I think it is cold for the tables to be underwater. Then I notice Jamie is gone. He's gone back to the apartment and left me out there in the dark, in my nighty, with all my clothes in a sack. I yell, \"Jamie, Jamie!\" I am angry but I still care about him as a friend. He appears at an upstairs door and looks sheepishly. I tell him I don't appreciate the way he's behaving, leaving me in the dark and etc. I say, \"Which one is your apartment?\" He points and I start to walk up the stairs. The wooden stairs give way. The stairs were a rope, wood ladder and the rope snapped. I land, unhurt but shaken. He laughs. I say, \"Now how am I going to get up there?\" He points to the stairs next to his, his neighbors. He comes down to walk up with me. He is concerned now. He goes up the stairs. I start up the stairs. I get nearly to the top and then I see the rope start to go. I look up at Jamie and the stairs tilt. I am very annoyed at him. I grab the ladder and we fall. I realize that if I don't scramble up the ladder as it falls, I'll be hurt because it's a long way down. I scramble and end up inches form the ground, unhurt. Jamie growls at the landlord's apartment. He doesn't like him (because Jamie is a homo) and looks for the maintenance person. He comes out and looks at the situation. 2 women tenants come out and look at the situation. I see a third stairway I could use to get to Jamie's apartment but I think, \"Huh! I'm getting a message here. 3rd time, the charm! There's some reason why I shouldn't go to Jamie's apartment. He obviously doesn't want me.\" Still, I wait for the maintenance man to fix the stairs. He's grumpy. He doesn't want to do it. The 2 women want the pinball or T.V. games hooked up. He shows them how to do it so they can do it themselves next time and not bother him. I say, \"Well, that's all very interesting but it's not getting me anywhere.\" The maintenance man looks at the landlord's apartment and glares. He mutters that he wishes he'd get home, and slowly sets about fixing the stairs. I comment, \"I don't like standing around in my underwear.\" Jamie laughs (embarrassed), and brags like a teenager, does an \"embarrassed shuffle\" with his body and says, \"I have 100, or actually 83 pairs of underpants that were given to me,\" like presents from admiring men. I make a sarcastic comment. (Earlier in the dream, I wondered why I left my nice house to go with Jamie. I missed my house but felt I was doing Jamie a favor. It would also  save us both money. Jamie laughed and said a joke about me paying our way and I said no, \"We both pay half.\" Then I asked if it was O.K. to have Muffin Cat. Jamie said, \"Oh, I guess it's O.K. but you'll have to pay a $50 deposit)."

I was on a street where there were lots of stores. I realized that I was in M City. I looked at people's faces hoping I might recognize people I went to high school with. I found a phone on the outside of a store. I noticed I was close to my cousin Terence's bicycle shop. I thought, \"I guess I'll drop in and say hi after I call doctor A.\" I looked in my purse for my address book. It was a loose leaf and the pages had gotten loose. I was struggling trying to find doctor A's number. A line of people were standing behind me. I saw two couples that were going together in high school and seemed to be still happy together. I said, \"I know you but I can't remember your names.\" One said, \"XXX\" and the other said, \"XXX.\" The girls said her name. I took off my sun glasses and said, \"I'm Barb Sanders.\" I took the glasses off again. I was aware of wrinkles around my eyes. They vaguely remembered me. As we were talking, I became aware that I was taking too long and so I offered the phone to the man waiting in line, if it were a quick call. He said, \"No, it's O.K.

She's doing the same thing, so I don't feel so bad. Finally, I get it all out. I look at things some more.

The road is now covered with ground up crackers and it's very hard to get up the hill! We start to lug down and spin our wheels. Some janitor is at the top of the hill cleaning up the halls of a school. We get to the halls and start to drive. A door is there. We can go out where there's barbed wire or sneak through a locked door. A woman teacher (young), hears us talking about needing to get to the summer activities. George is pointing them out and how we'll sneak through the federal door. She looks disapprovingly. I assure her we won't do that. She offers to show us how to get through the barbed wire back to the road. We carefully step over the wire. She points to a device that tracks and shoots our laser beams to deter unauthorized persons. She says, \"It doesn't work,\" and if we use caution, we can get through unhurt. I point out to her that I see a laser beam. It's slow and misses its mark. Then we sneak past it and go on."

It starts out as a note from a registrar to him about his needing to add or drop a class. There are then a series of notes by him answered by someone else. I see the name Barb and think, \"That's probably his wife.\" I don't understand the significance of this paper but I want to because it's a gift to me. I open the next gift. I see a series of potholders. I say, \"Oh how nice. I can use these.\" I then exclaim, \"Oh, it's miniature. I can put it in the miniature house we've been building.\" I then see there are lots of miniature things like a stove, and a laundry hamper with clothes in it. I peek under the clothes and see peanuts. My brother Dwight is hovering near by. I want him to go away because this is a special moment with Peter M. I say, \"Oh, they are a lot of miniatures and things for the house! How silly of me not to connect that when I first saw them.\" Then Peter M, whose eyes tell me he cares for me but is slightly turned away from me, says in an anguished voice, \"You have about 19 things you need to do in Dover. How are you going to manage it?\" He meant I have many creative things to do and how can I support myself and do them too? I feel warmth because he cares. I say, \"I don't know. I'll just do it somehow. I've got some ideas. I'm working on it.\" He looks at me. I think, \"How sweet.\" He wants to offer to take care of me, financially, and be with me so he and I can do these creative things. Then I say, \"This summer, Maggie and I are going to do a book. She's a photographer (he grimaces because he is too), and we'll do a picture/story book.\" I sense he'd like to do that with me. Dwight is still hanging around and I really want him to leave! Then, I look at his next gift. It's a beautiful paint set, brushes, luxurious, colored bristles. I thank him. He's standing again, getting ready to leave.

I walk through the tunnel under the river. I finally reach the stairs on the other side. I go up the stairs. I'm pulling hair pins out of my hair. I get to the top of the stairs. Ethan comes out. He's placating me, apologizing. I glare at him and yell some more. I'm opening a mirror to put on my stage makeup. One eyebrow is put on the wrong place. The other one keeps smudging. Ethan says to me, \"My daughter had a dream about a jury. What can it mean?\" I say, \"You idiot! She is the jury and the judge!\" He says, \"But what does it mean?\" \"It means,\" I speak slowly and witheringly, \"that she is feeling guilt. She is sitting in judgement of herself.\" He sits back and looks sad and guilty. He's aware that he's partially at fault."

I'm running up some stairs, and a herd of guards are after me. I run into a cell-like room and I'm trapped. Seconds before they find me, I hide up on a beam near the ceiling. They look for me and then assume I fell to my death as it's a tower room. The Queen is there. Now I hide and peek and sneak around so they don't find me. I hear voices and run down a flight of stairs. Then I hear more voices coming up the stairs. I hide in a cupboard. It's the changing of the guard and a group of soldiers are coming by me. The officer in charge looks into the cupboard but they don't see me. Then I listen to their instructions of who will guard what so I'll know where not to be. There are 2 guards at each of the 2 doors on the top, or the 4th floor. 2 guards at each end of the 4 doors on the 3rd floor, etc. They leave. Then I see a gaggle of young women. One of them is going to be engaged to the prince. The Queen mother has chosen her. She's unhappy because she's sure he doesn't love her. He still is forlorn because he loves me. Then there's an engagement party. Her parents, a King and Queen come. The King wears a black toga with a red scarf or roses on it. She has an ornate head dress, like the one in Alice in Wonderland. The King is plump and annoyed. He doesn't want the match. Then I see a picture of black men in Africa. I think, \"Oh that's another story in this book,\" (I see a book). I hear a narration. The picture is a ragged line of black men, one has only one leg. They are in the fields and are shooting rifles. \"They don't know it but they are encountering Jedi warriors,\" the narration goes. \"It's the first battle of the war.\" I see them freeze-frame and they are all dying, like a firing squad line. One turns a backward somersault from the force of the impact of all the bullets."

I painstakingly finger spell, wishing I had learned sign language because it must be frustrating for him to have to converse so slowly. He holds the ear muffs up to the crowd and tries to speak. He has a voice, but he sounds deaf. Everyone in the pool shuts up and is embarrassed. I intervene and scold them for being insensitive and fearful and ignorant about disabilities. I then can't remember the sign for \"B.\" I ask someone, Ginny or Bonnie.

I decide not to chance making my own. I say, \"Give me a good standard ball, then there's no question about its weight.\" I then see an \"instant\" replay of the decision about the unfair ball. As I watch, a man with a camera comes close up to my face. I feel like crying because of the injustice of an unfair ball. As the tears start to flow, he starts to take a picture. He's encouraging me to cry. \"Come on honey, that's it.\" I feel exploited and turn to him, with an angry face and yell, \"Just what do you think you're doing?!\" I then go out on the court and take the 4 men on one at a time. I'm good. I beat them. They are very surprised (I wake up because I hear an odd voice in my mind saying, \"Knock, knock, knock, knock.\" I thought someone was in the room or outside my door until I woke up)."

All this is taking time and I just want to get on with my journey. I pound my steering wheel and say, \"Damn it!\" We are on a one way narrow road that spirals down and down and down. I am aware that if I had been quick enough just before the spiral started, I could have taken a left road that would have got me back on the highway easier. I feel like it's \"one of those days,\" nothing goes right. We end up in a room. An older woman, the captain of a ferry boat, comes over. I ask her how to get back up to the highway. She says, \"The only way to do that is to take my ferry and it will cost.\" There are 3 ferry rides between here and central (state). I realize we are far below the highway, perhaps deep in the river already. I see it rushing past and wonder how you start a ferry ride when you're under water to start with. I think, \"This woman is just trying to get money out of me.\" I ask her, \"Well, how do you get back on the highway?

One gets in my elevator and stands to my left. The other gets in the other elevator which is open to mine now. I know they are going to hurt me because I said I'm weak. I see a pile of crutches and canes. I push #6 button and run over and pick up my cane. As they lunge for me, I fight them off with my cane. I escape out of the elevator but it's only for the second floor. It takes courage but I get back on the elevator because it's too much pain/energy to walk up the stairs. The men are gone. I get to the 6th floor. Terence and his bride are off in their bedroom sleeping, on an extended honeymoon. A \"hippie\" guy comes to the door and asks to speak to Terence. I tell him, \"Terence is unavailable because he's on his honeymoon.\" The guy is quite upset. I call Terence. Terence comes out, walks over to him, and says, \"Listen, you little fucker, leave me alone. I don't like you.\" Other relatives are shocked that he talks this way. I am wearing a bride's dress and veil. I raise my eyebrow and speak in a clear voice. Everyone is impressed with me. They know I'm angry and Terence's going to get in trouble. I walk up to Terence and say, \"Would you be kind enough to step into the library for a moment?\" He does so. It's like a dad calling his son on the carpet. I put my hands behind my back and pace back and forth and lecture him. \"You will never, I said never, call anyone a 'fucker' again. You will be honest and polite.\" I then role-play with him on how to tell the guy that he doesn't like him and how to ask for him to go away assertively. He listens gravely and practices his role-play."

There is snow on the sidewalk to the indented place I have the ship. I tell my crew to remove the snow so people can walk there with ease. Then I see there's no water where I have the ship and the space is only 2 or 3 feet deep. I am concerned that the ship won't stay upright, so I order water in. It comes rushing in. Then I order the trailer with a wheel off the bottom of the ship. It goes away. I feel very buoyed up by the water. It's like riding a balloon. I'm then in consultation with 2 of my crew. One has invented a captain's chair that moves through the air at any angle with ease. He's going to demonstrate it and lecture about it. Then I see some cats. I greet them affectionately. They are mine. I had been around when they were born. I then see 3 black and white half-grown cats. I call them to me. I want to get to know them because I had been gone when they were born. We start to make friends but they are shy. A robust older man, who reminds me of the St. Bernard, comes over. He's worked out a captain's chair also. He shows me his plans. He has an ornate set of directions with it, like a crossword puzzle combined with a jigsaw puzzle. He sees the black and white cats and greets them lovingly. He calls them \"my darlings.\" He says, \"Have you met them yet?\" I say, \"I'm in the process of meeting them.\" I feel a little jealous of his good relationship with them. He is interested in the fact that my crew has also invented a chair. I call my crew member over. He's obstinate, proud, and only partially clothed. He displays the chair like he's a male model, somewhat cold. Then I decide the chair has some \"bugs\" in the design and needs working on. I then am discussing the use of balloons as condoms. I see lots of people blowing up balloons to put in the vagina. I feel nervous because I can't figure out how that would prevent pregnancy and I've told people that the balloon works. I then realize that the balloon needs to be on the penis. Then I have 2 worries: l.) Balloons are not very sturdy and might break. Real condoms are made for that purpose, and 2.) The opening of a balloon is small and might be painful for the man. A man shows me a how wide the balloon opening stretches so I feel relieved about that. I realize that many people now have the balloons. I sold them to people and I'm worried that I might have given them a bad product. One woman shrugs and says, \"Well, we'll know if it works in about 5 months.\" I feel badly because by then, it would be too late to correct anything."

I think I'm very sad about Howard and other relationships. Anyway, the counselor (who looks like Dr. X), tells me he's married. Then he shows me pictures of some friends of his. Blake is one. I exclaim, \"Oh! I know him.\" Them I see a picture of Darryl. I am amazed. I ask, \"Is he your friend too? I know him well. He and I were going to be married, only I married Howard.\" Dr. X says, \"Oh! Darryl is my boss.\" I exclaim, \"Your boss! What does he do?\" \"Oh,\" says Dr. X, \"he fixes cars and he's very good. He fixes foreign cars.\" I am amazed and have pleasant nostalgia feelings about Darryl and I feel sad because I've lost him. Then a woman comes in. She's crying. She's Dr. X's friend. She has terminal cancer. She has come in to help me understand. She says, \"It's a good thing Dr. X is single so they can be friends.\" It's l:30 a.m. My mother calls. She says that the doctors say Aunt Charlotte is going to have a \"specific exam.\" \"What can that mean?\" She doesn't like it. I say, \"Well, of course she'll have a specific exam if she's got cancer.\" My mother says, \"Shut up,\" and hangs up on me. I feel badly for 2 reasons. I said the word cancer in front of this lady who is dying of it, and I was too open, non-caring and insensitive with my mother. I hurt her feelings and wasn't helpful. The woman cries. There's now another woman and a daughter, maybe 13 years old or so. Dr. X assists her to calm down. I am sitting on a cot. The woman lays down on the cot and Dr. X starts undressing her. He talks soothingly as he takes off her corset and girdle and other layers of underwear. She lays there crying slightly. The 13 year old takes off her clothes and lays down beside the woman. The girl pinches her pretty young half-grown breast. Her mom takes her hand away and says, \"You did it too deep.\" Dr.X says, \"See, it's like this.\" He palpates the woman's breast, looking for bumps. \"I don't feel one here,\" he says. I see scars and wrinkles on the woman's body. I get up to leave. I want to stay but I must go home to see if my mother's alright. I still feel badly about my insensitivity. I get in the car and drive. I get lost. I'm tired and sleepy. I realize that I'm running away from the warm and sexy feelings back at the apartment. I accidentally turn onto a railroad track. A train is coming up behind me. I duck off the tracks, just in time. An older man looks at me. I say, \"Guess I took the wrong turn.\" He shrugs. I ask, \"What do you think my chances are to go back the way I came?\" He said, \"Late at night they don't come as often, so you might make it.\" Then he asks if I think my car can make it up the hilly pasture. I decide to try it, feeling unsure. I feel an urgency to get back to the apartment. I berate myself for leaving. It's just like me to run from a good thing. I go back. Dr. X is still there. I take off my clothes and get in bed with him. He says, \"You left before we could explain that what we did was a demonstration of a man being a friend to a woman.\" I want to make love to him. He's all skinny and shivering from the cold. He looks blue or greenish and clutches the covers around him. I grab him and at first it appears that I'm trying to put his whole body in my vagina, head first. I'm saying, \"Get in there.\" I then see that I'm trying to help him back in bed as he's slipped out. He has a comic look of dismay on his face. I feel angry. Then Dr. X leaves. I've discovered that he's not really a counselor but an excellent con artist who is good enough to be a counselor but does it for kicks. He hears crying in a room as he passes. He peeks in. A fat woman is crying. There are 4 women nearly naked. Dr. X (now looks like Peter O'Toole), looks interested in the situation. He very soothingly goes to the women and starts counseling them. As he subtly gains their confidence, he edges into the bed with them and lays his head on the pillow which is the huge bra of the fat woman. He smiles like a Cheshire cat. His arms are behind his head and one knee is crossed over the other, very relaxed and happy. The women cry out that a man had offered to make love to them and they'd just found out he was a fairy. Now they won't be able to have babies, which is why they were going to all this work of making love. He was \"balling them blind\" and he lied! They've been had and used. Dr. X smiles because he's got the answer and he'll love every minute of it."

She is given a new born baby to inspect. She looks it over. It looks fine. It's very pretty baby girl. She looks at the chart. She reads off things, then she sees a word, \"amphetamines\" or \"antihistamines.\" I'm not sure which. She figures, \"Uh oh, that's bad but maybe it's not too bad. Maybe the baby can be kept.\" I walk up and look at the baby and the chart. I point to the word and say, \"This baby has a heart condition and can't be kept. The other woman is very sad. As I hold the baby, it starts to turn blue and distorts its body. It is dying of a heart attack. I feel pretty matter-of-fact. The other woman feels very sad. Now I am the visiting women in the bed. I'm trying to sleep and lots of people walk through. I try to ignore them. An older man walks by (he's married to the older woman/me). He looks at me in the bed, waves in a cheerful, friendly manner and says, \"Hey, XXX, how's it going?\" I think to myself, \"Boy, that's pretty tolerant for a husband to be so friendly to a guy in his wife's bed.

I feel fine about the Indians and chide the white people and feel embarrassed when the Indians hear it. Now the whole thing turns into a play. I'm on stage doing a comedic dance. The story is that this man and this woman go to the Philippines to get married. On the day of their wedding, they go sunning on the beach and get a terrible sun burn, so when they dance, they move very stiltedly being careful not to touch anything. The audience laughs at our funny dance. At the end of it, we walk \"nearly arm-in-arm,\" only not touching, down the stairs into the audience. I'm wearing a white 2 piece bathing suit. Then I quickly run back stage to change for the marriage scene. I wear a beautiful wedding dress and veil. The joke is that we're still sun burned, so it won't be much fun on the wedding night. There is an elaborate dance scene where the white people in groups would watch a \"phillipine\" do something (like hold a job, bake a cake, etc.) and cry out in unison the questions, \"A phillippine???\" I danced around trying to shut them up. One group of women were shocked that a woman \"philippine\" could do what she did. The next sequence, I'm standing off stage singing an intro for a guy who'll play the piano in the audience. I sing and then someone hits the piano note I should be on. I was down one key. I feel a quick flash of embarrassment but continue. The piano guy really flubs up. He forgets his words, and he's near tears. He then tries valiantly to be cool about it. I coach him from off-stage. He follows my lead. Then he asks me to come sit by him and sing for him. I go there but only sing in a whisper so he can hear the words and then can sing them. He does so. Then I'm playing the part of a villain who wraps up a paper package with a straight pin with a colored round pin head on it stuck in the package. That pin was the fuse for the bomb. When the guy shut the piano top so he could drive his \"jeep\" around, it would strike the pin and then blow up. I crept about obviously and the audience loved it. The piano guy isn't too happy as he is getting blown up. I realize the play is reaching its finale and I was disappointed that I'd have to take my curtain call in the unflattering guise of a spy and villain instead of the lovely bride."

I find a square gauze patch on the back of his leg. Then I see transparent tape running down his leg to his knee. I say, \"Here, I'll take this tape off.\" He says, \"Can't you leave me any pride?\" I smile at his stubbornness."

She'd see a situation and tell people what they need to do and where they need to sit, etc. I'm embarrassed. As the show starts, she moves away from me, like she's embarrassed for me. The show is set up like a three-ring circus. We applaud when they set up drums near our side. \"Oh good,\" I say, \"now I can see. I was worried.\" I say, \"Oh! Are those the drums? They are huge!\" They're so big, the performers sit in them. Many performers come out, a huge black man, and a huge black woman with 6 breasts. The \"star,\" a young man with dark hair says, \"Now there's a woman! Hey, big mama!\" I am amazed. 2 older white guys sit down to sing an old folk tune. A woman sitting on my right sings with them. They sing very softly so they can assist her to sing. She's embarrassed and can't remember all the words. I'm a little envious. I'd like to sing too but I don't know the song. The performers throw gifts out to the audience. I catch a bunch of small Hershey bars. I pass them out to others, Rosemary, my \"daughter,\" and others. Then I catch some spearmint gum and pass them out, keeping one for myself. I've become the contact person in my area of the audience. I look in my purse and separate all my little presents into one section. I have necklace chains that have static electricity in them, little earrings, one shaped like false teeth, little costume jewelry pins, candy canes and some other stuff. A young black boy hands out an outfit for a 13 month old baby. I hold it up to my daughter. \"Will it fit?\" She says, \"I think it will.\" I question it. I decide it doesn't and give it back to the boy. He says, \"Hang it on the Xmas tree and someone else will want it.\" I feel like I'd like to keep it but that it wouldn't be fair to others.

I might be pregnant and I need to get hold of him.\" Then I remember that I couldn't be pregnant, we didn't make love. Finally I say, \"Goodbye,\" and turn and walk away. I start to cross a street.

I casually look in as I walk by and I'm stunned to see a picture of my friend as a newspaper headline, \"Wallton Returns.\" There is a picture of him running amuck with his clothes ripped in shreds, down to the street.

They weren't sure of my name so they spelled it Sanders, Saunders, Pepper. I came in and sat down. I am told to rate the performance of the actors/actresses. I see. I do so. One guy, I think his name is Peter (Brook or Brown, wearing glasses like XXX), does an excellent scene. As he finishes, the director says, \"You have the part.\" There is some confusion because a woman had done an excellent scene and they mixed him up with her/or he was her or something. Anyway, he sits down behind me, grinning. I say, \"That's very good.\" He shrugs and says, \"Oh. I'm a professional actor. I get paid. I'm just doing this for fun. Maybe it's not fair to other (amateurs).\" I then notice that they haven't called my name. The male director is giving instructions to the amateurs, to get into groups, to be in the group for the character you're interested in. I think about calling myself to the director's attention but decide not to. I assume that it's because I walked in on crutches. I get up and look for a group. I start to get into a big group when I hear someone call my name. It's Mabel. She and one other woman are in a group to audition for \"Sally.\" I join them. We walk. Mabel is nervous. Then we have to go back to our original seats until we're called. I'm slightly annoyed because it's a long way to walk. Rachel's in the front row and I'm mid-way back, on opposite sides. I go back and 3 women are in my seat. They are crowded around the professional actor. I am annoyed. Peter and a woman get into a fight, verbally. I think he just tells her to leave, arrogantly. I get very angry at him and tell him off. He laughs and baits me. I'm ready to fist fight him but I don't want to. He's laughing at me, egging me on, looking superior. I'm very angry. He puts his hands over his crotch and dares me to hit it. Then he puts his hands over his nose and dares me to hit it. I see the baiting and I don't fall into the trap. I beat on him. I'm good enough to make the attention of the director. He's interested in me now. I feel strong because I didn't back down, and I didn't have to use my crutches. I was apparently eloquent. The director then starts the auditioning and I sit down. I see it's the \"Sally's\" turn, so I get up and walk to the front. Mabel is doing her audition. She's speaking softly. A woman assistant director says to another assistant, \"Oh, she's so young and pretty and has a good, loud voice that carries. I like her!\" Then it's my turn and I stand there with a script book (everyone else has it memorized). She (the woman assistant director) says, \"Oh wait, why are you auditioning for this character?\" I say, \"Well, frankly, I've not read the play. I'm doing a cold reading and I don't know the characters. I just chose a group that looked like me and I knew Mabel. The 2 women assistant directors grimace at each other but tolerate my lack of professional preparedness. I say, \"I'll read anything you suggest.\" They say, \"Oh, read 'Art Brown and Brown Licks Cat'.\" I am delighted when I find the part (on Page 92, the last page), because it's a woman who thinks she's a cat. It will be a fun part to play. I begin. I speak loudly and confidently. I'm good."

My brothers are assisting the bad guys not to be suspicious. I am a male. The sister is upset to see me. She feels used. We like each other but here I am stealing from her family. I assure her that I really do like her for herself. She then becomes a male Mexican doctor and I become her. He's going to hide me. We hear the bad guys coming back in. I hide in a closet and put a towel over me. He worries that I'll be stupid and not hide myself well, but I'm very good at it. He and I are talking after the coast is clear and we hear them coming near again. I slide under a shelf and then Bonnie is describing how she wanted to make love to the doctor but it hurt, so she requested he come in from behind. She called it the scrota or the ova. I watch and become sexually excited and ask for Brian's phone number and then I write it down. I'm going to call him up and ask him to make love with me."

I look closely at the windows and try to remember how it was before at grandma Mildred's house. I realize that it is just the furniture that is moved.

My mother is so impressive, it must hurt her hands and she must get tired but she still keeps doing things to make the place nice. Now there's a meeting. I must take minutes. I write rapidly. Someone's talking to me. I turn to her and say, \"Hey! Come on! I'm trying to take minutes here. Leave me alone for awhile.\" She then does. I'm laying on my tummy on the floor. Tom B is explaining how he's waiting for a teacher to get information to him before he finishes his project. Dickie challenges him and says, \"It's your fault. You need to do something first, then the teacher can respond.\" I get confused on the issues and write it to the best of my abilities. Aunt Elaine comes in. A boy stands behind her. She says, \"Are you hiding or are you just trying to keep me warm?\" She's pleasant, maternal, and wears a revealing dress. Her daughter Patricia, my cousin, is more primly dressed and standoffish. I look past them at the door and wonder if my mother remodeled their bedroom too (It feels like the S City house there)."

I see a mother deer and her fawn, except the mother deer has antlers. I call to the family to see the pretty sight. They bolt, but run into the house through a side door. I follow. The family exclaims at how cute they are. They run back out. I go into the side room. I see old furniture and chairs. I realize that there are things left here from the previous owner. I'm delighted; I'll find something wonderful. I look. I find toys in a dresser, children's sized chairs and a child's piano. I also find Sony tape records, very large and lots of buttons, a small color T.V., and beautiful old fashioned dresses, one all black, and some books. I make the books be there because I am disappointed in the \"treasure.\" I notice this room doesn't have an open door to the main house and I wonder how the family saw the deer and then this baby. My \"dad\" is telling me about how as a young man, he had to climb down a sheer cliff to a beach with the boys to prove his bravery, like each boy had to. He remembered being very afraid, but he did it. I asked him, \"What for? What was at the bottom of the cliff?\" He says, \"A passive beach.\" I see turbulent ocean waves and wonder why I can't see a passive beach. Then his cousin Seymour is describing his first date with his new wife Dixie. They are \"first cousins\" and as children, Seymour ran to the car to greet the family and said to her, \"Oh! There you are,\" and walked away together to play. Now I'm in a small room that is a portion of a long line of rooms like a hall way. I'm retarded. I'm brushing my hair. A young man comes into the room. I sense danger from him. He leaves the room. I know he's locking doors so I can't escape. I think to myself, \"What will I do? He's going to want to make love to me. I don't have any birth control. I won't make love to him.\" I feel proud that I think ahead and make a decision. He comes back into the room. He's mean. The mirror I am looking into turns into a space heater, a cage with 3 heating elements and a door on it. I think he snuck in and put a mouse in there to scare me. It'd be a dead mouse by now, because of all the heat. I look, it was all in my head, a fantasy, there is no mouse there."

Ingrid Bergman is listed as with Cary Grant.\" The secretary and I are very impressed with the clarity of the dream stuff. Then suddenly, I get an inspiration. I say, \"Don't you see?

My nephew,\" she says. \"Does that mean you suspect him?\" I nod yes and I suddenly realize that it goes one step further and links up with the secretary. She then realizes it and we look at each other, concerned, confused, and embarrassed. (Oh, I remember that when I read the list of stars and who was with them, me secretary said, \"But how could you know that?\" I said, \"I didn't, not on a conscious level, but I must have heard it or read it sometime, everything goes into the unconscious and comes back up when it's needed.\" I felt very impressed at the workings of the unconscious mind)."

I help him and then I'm embarrassed because we're standing up, fully clothed and in a hallway. People could easily see us. I tell him this. He pulls back and apologizes. He says he's sorry. He just loves me so much that he couldn't wait. Then he says he knows how wrong he was. I feel like dismissing all my former bad thoughts about his actions. I do so. Later, we are making love. It is wonderful. Then doors need to be shut to keep out the upsurge of the ocean, so we want doors. I rush and shut the doors and I feel fear that it will get in anyway.

I say, \"I don't want to be a part of your project.\" It is hard for me to say because the drug makes me want to go. I say it several times and he just stands there waiting for me, because he knows the drug is powerful. I'll be sucked into another being like in the invasion of the body snatchers. I run to my \"dad\" and plead with him, telling him I don't want to, and to please help! I'm trying to but I'm growing weaker. \"Please help me!\" He doesn't respond to me other than to weakly smile at me to acknowledge that he has heard me. I grab my cousin, who before I had seen as weak and silly and cling to him, hugging him hard, hanging on like he was my anchor to that room. Then a fat lady, mostly naked is dancing at a party. Her husband picks her up off the floor and makes love to her. He is detached, fully clothed, and his back is to me. She is fully exposed. I see her vagina. I see her face clearly. A prim blonde woman sits rigidly beside them. I am shocked. This is on T.V. After he's done, the man sticks a fat piece of paper in the blonde woman's mouth. She is disgusted. It's a symbol of a large penis. Her red lipstick forms an \"o\" around it. Then I am upstairs in my bedroom. I wake up from a nightmare. I run downstairs, crying, \"The little men are inside my stomach!\" I'm crying. My Uncle or grandfather soothes me. He says, \"No, it isn't possible. I've been barricading the stairs for you all night.\" I am not comforted. I go back upstairs. I sit on the bed and hug my nanny. She is an old square robot, and not very sophisticated. I ask it, \"Why aren't there any nice men for me?\" It says, \"Look, there are,\" and shows me two of them (on a screen on its chest). I say, \"But if I take them, what will be left for my brother!\" Nanny laughs and shows me many women for Dwight. I am still worried. Then I'm at a dance, watching the musicians. One can't find his banjo. Then he finds it and sees that something has eroded the outside. I realize that what ever \"they\" touch, corrodes like that and that \"they\" are there. I turn and the man is standing there, smiling. He says, \"It's so close. We almost had you.\" I try to resist."

I go looking. One of the guys is Zach. He follows me and stays near. It's pleasant. I am equally aware of his presence and the search for my girls. I am upstairs. I look down over the balcony rail. I see Dovre who is a cat nursing her baby kittens, 2 mal cats (male but I left the \"e\" off mal) approach. I say, \"I didn't know Dovre had kittens!\" I am surprised and a little shocked. I don't like the looks of the male cats. They look threatening. As I'm leaning over the rail, Zach leans over on me, gently. I realize he's interested in me sexually and I caress his leg with my foot while pretending to look over the rail. We are both happy. He has asked; I've said, \"Yes.\" We go downstairs to shoo away the bad male cats. I then see that it wasn't Dovre but it was a paper cut out of a cat and many baby kittens. It was a joke.

I ask if it will be safe as some of the racks are open. He says, \"Sure, no problems!\" I get in. They make me feel comfortable. They offer me a drink. They ask how far I'm going. I say, \"Louisville, Kentucky.\" They are amazed. So are they. \"Ah! You must be a paleontologist,\" (to the driver). He agrees. I say, \"So is my father. I'm meeting him there!\" We talk. I mention my father has a master's. They mention proudly, \"He has a doctorate!\" I ask if they have a bathroom. They say, \"Yes, but it isn't fixed up to use.\" They ask if I need to go. I say, \"Yes, but I'll wait!\""

Everyone around me rushes to be close to him. I don't. I'm alone on my bench. I look up at the ceiling and tisk tisk. \"Frank\" watches me. The governor makes a joke. He says that the next time Frank complains about paying taxes, he should remember that the governor contributed to his income by paying to get in.

I watch as the first one catches on fire and explodes, then the second and then the third. Now we are sort of survivors of that. It's snowing, like the North pole. Survival is difficult. My character, now male, puts his feet up on a hot stove, lights a cigarette lighter and has some hot coffee and food. \"Fortunately,\" he says, \"we have the means for survival. Too bad he's here,\" referring to the crappy professor who is setting up a sleeping bag. \"He can stand anything as long as I don't touch his Mary.\" The professor echoes, \"That I couldn't stand.\" The man, \"or that other woman.\" Professor, \"I could stand that, but I wouldn't like it.\" The man, \"or....\" Professor, \"I could stand that...\" on it goes."

I clean up and put on my space helmet. I try to lock the door. It won't lock. A man helps me. I try to turn on a radio to hear the countdown. Mitch says it's best to hear it from the PA system. We linger over goodbyes. It feels nice to be with him."

Diane is putting away her dishes in the pretty glass cabinet in the wall. I say, \"Wait. I have some pretty things I want to display too. We should share this equally.\" She smiles and says \"Or 60, 90.\" Now we are in the living room and I say \"I have a TV, stereo, and a VCR.\" Diane says, \"I have a VCR and a clock-radio.\" Her voice is soft and I ask her to speak up as I can't hear her well. I suggest we use my couch. She says, \"I've seen your couch. I'd rather use mine.\" I say, \"Where is it?\" She points. It is rickety, ugly, yellow and low to the ground. I say, \"I can't sit on this because it's too low.\" We negotiate. Diane asks me 3 times, but I can't hear her. She's embarrassed. Finally I understand that she's on welfare and I need to write a statement that I haven't given her money. Then Ginny comes in and sits down. I'm eating a sweet sticky chocolate. She mumbles and I ask her to speak up. She's concerned that the 2 workmen will try to cheat me and warns me not to pay them. They took a covered glass dish and didn't pay for it. both ways."

He has a gun and he intends to kill me. He's a hit man. I pull out a rifle, which I can see, but I aim it at him and tell him I'll shoot. He laughs. He's confident I haven't the guts. I do fire, at his hands, or arms. I don't want to kill him. I just want him to stop trying to hurt me. He's surprised, but not worried. He pulls out a knife and threatens me. I shoot again. He's not hurt or affected. I turn and run -- to hide. Outside is a big bushy tree. I climb up and hide in the bushy part. I worry that he'll figure out my strategy, or that I made a dumb mistake staying so close by. I figure he'd figure that I took off fast. He does see me in the tree. I wasn't still enough and birds chattered and flew around, giving me away. He's going to force me to go into this dark hole, to my death. I turn and dive into the hold in an attempt to outsmart him. Either I'll kill myself trying to escape or I'll outsmart him. I free-fall a long way and end up in a basement. I turn to the left, and go down several flights of stairs. I find a tiny door with small knobs. It's a dumb waiter. I almost cry in frustration because I can't get the door open, and then it opens and I crawl in and hand pull myself back up to the ground level. I'm wondering if I made a mistake. I go to a hotel and sign in with a fake name and go to my room to rest. As I sit, I notice with horror that my own personal brand of shampoo is in the room and I know he has found me! I pull aside the shower curtains and he is there -- dressed up and nice. He has brought me a present. He hands me a baby. It is my \"ex-husband\" by another woman. I think the baby is cute and start to feed it. I get the feeling the guy wants to marry me."

I look in a window and see food. I choose an apple and an apple juice. Then I notice I've chosen both of the same kind. I go inside to pay. One reporter is nice and sympathetic. I notice him. As I leave the store, there are 2 or 3 stairs. The crowd is wild and wants to help. I snap my chair around and yell, \"If you don't get out of the way, I'll twirl around and you'll get hurt. This is a warning.\" I then twirl around and go down the stairs backwards. I go on down the street. I see a big beautiful old house, cream-colored with huge, sturdy and ornately carved beams and columns. It is now divided into apartments, but it once was an elegant home. The nice man says, \"It is beautiful. Do you like it?\" I breathe, \"Oh yes.\" I try to look in the windows. He says, \"How would you like the windows?\" I say, \"Big and airy, but in the back. I like the smaller ones in the front.\" He nods. I see inside, fireplaces, pools and lovely fountains and tile work. A woman sits by a big window. I go on down the street. I see two women. They are old friends of the man. I am holding a baby. I say to the woman, \"Here. Hold the baby and pat it and kiss it like I've seen you do. The baby needs it.\" She takes the baby, but they are too rough and uncaring. I ask for the baby back. I say, \"If you can't do it right, then I'll do it.\" I kiss and caress the baby softly.

I find Christmas cards I had been writing and suddenly realize it's May and the information will be outdated by Christmas. It's a waste of time. I keep them in the trunk. I see lots of newspaper sheets in the ink that are so big that when I try to shut the trunk, they're hanging out. I remove them reluctantly, and wad them up."

After the kisses, she and the other woman turn toward us, the audience, and wink with big fake smiles on (pretty hair do and bright red lipstick). She cries loudly about her mother's death and I suddenly realize it is two lesbian women who are kissing sexually and pretending to us they are lamenting the mom's death. I feel surprised.

She's had five husbands, each one for just a few years; some died, some divorced. I go to the Dairy Queen. There is a turquoise Cadillac, 1955, there. I drive it around. There are two matching turquoise pistols on the hood. I have to take the car back. I try to turn left on a road full of bumper-to-bumper traffic. Finally I get to the D.Q. Others push the car as the engine isn't on. I pull in. The owner seems relieved as he didn't know what happened to the car. People are bringing books to a used book sale. A woman hands in a pile of books that are the best of the bunch. I see Science Fiction titles."

There are lots of other people in the tree. The water buffalo decides to try and reach me. He rears up and stretches his nose and I scramble up higher and higher. I'm now clinging to some pretty skinny branches. He finally goes away. I climb down and Tyler and I continue walking, talking excitedly about our narrow escape. Then I notice Tyler isn't there. I look around and see I'm in a bad neighborhood, sleazy bars, etc. I think, \"Where is Tyler when you need him?\" I look behind me and see Tyler and Mabel talking and laughing. I feel jealous and hurt. I keep walking. Mabel catches up and I want to share the buffalo story, but I don't to \"teach her\" or punish him. Then I relent and tell her. Joe F. is ahead and has a skinny, flimsy motorbike. He asks me to help get it started. I tease him. So do some tough guys. Now I'm in a house. I want to go outside and go to an extension of the house and get a book, but it's dark outside and I turn on the porch light, but decide it's safer to go back in and go through the house to get to the extension to get my book."

I wanted to go to bed. I got into a small, thin brass bed but the covers and pillows wouldn't stay put. It was uncomfortable. I was very angry. I pushed and shoved to throw her out and she'd keep popping back in. I looked out the window and Arvonne was dressing up to go out. She was putting on a blond wig. It was a brassy, bright bee hive blonde hairdo. I was glad she was getting out of my way too. Now I'm in my room and sort of on a boat in a closed up space. A horrible dog/boy creature is attacking me and it bites savagely. A man behind me says, \"I'll help. Let me do that.\" I say nothing but continue to take the attack. It is very painful; constant and scary. Ellie is also attacking. I throw it away and it lunges back at me. I scream in agony and frustration. The man can't take it anymore. He grabs the horrible attacking thing and throws it into a garbage disposal. I scream, \"No!\" and hear the grinding up of its body and can't bear the thought of its pain or death. I don't want to cause anyone else pain. Then I look again in renewed horror because the thing is now four times larger, an ugly large boy, and he's crawling out of the garbage disposal to get me even worse. I run to escape. I go into a room, like a living room or a captain's bedroom of a boat. I go to the tall windows and try to climb up, pulling myself hand over hand up the drapes. Each drape I try to climb up falls and is replaced by another drape. This happens over and over and over. I know now I'm trapped. I panic, sobbing. I pick up objects off the dresser to heave it at the window to break it open and it just bounces off like it was Mylar plastic windows. Nothing I do helps. I am condemned to this hell for eternity."

You should try it before you put it down.\" I shrug and agree to try it. I get on the plane, which is like a motorcycle. He is behind me with his arms around me to reach the controls. I wonder if it is too hard for him to control the plane from that awkward position. He shows me how to move levers and buttons. (To get to the plane, we had to go through a secret panel, down a ladder into a secret huge room.) I was being stared at by the other Indians because I was the enemy and I might tell where this place is. I look out to sea where we can take off. I see meadow and trees and think, \"Not enough room here.\" I am aware of a wall that looks like a mural of a forest. I am aware that it is a false wall hiding the runway, and yet I am not aware of it. Before we can fly, we gather around to sing. He begins to sing. It is pretty, but ordinary. I say to him, \"Sing it like you mean it. Sing it to someone.\" He looks to me with loving eyes, and sings with warmth, depth and beauty. I look at him and enjoy. After the song he gets up and walks to me and we hug. I feel the fat of his plump face and the scraggly whiskers. He says to me, \"I love you.\" I hesitate. I say, \"I know.\" I want to return the words, but feel constrained. I don't say it. I think, \"Maybe I'll grow into loving him slowly.\" Now I am a member of their side. But before we can fly a mission, I must go back up with the group and appear normal with them. Then I will sneak off to the plane. So I go there and chit chat and he gathers up my stuff. He puts them near the secret door. I go and bow and go to the secret door. I know she suspects and is looking for me. I must hurry. The secret door is the wooden slate table my father made when I was 13. There is a curtain behind it and then the ladder down. The stuff is backed up, too much stuff: Coke, paper cups, sweater, books, etc. I may get caught if it doesn't go down the ladder faster. I poke and try to hide it all. At the last second it goes down and so do I."

I tell the woman, \"This isn't right.\" I lecture her on how the child will hear her words and try to live up to them. \"So you should tell your child positive things.\" Dovre returns with a full bottle of water and some food. Everyone eats. The woman had been angry at me at first but was now agreeing with me. I decide I'm hungry and the food is gone, so I ask where she got the food. \"The little store, but they haven't much of a selection,\" she answers. So I go into the little store. Bakery goods or packaged snack junk food - cookies, cakes, corn chips, pretzels, etc. I notice then a door, and through the door I see a small town's main street. I edge near the door peering, thinking maybe there's a restaurant or another store with more nutritious food, but decide it's too much work. I decide to find something in here. There is a shelf of little old-fashioned TVs. The owners are looking at me suspiciously like I might grab something and run through the door. I get some stuff and go back to the family. Now \"I\" am a woman waiting at the table and a drunk young man returns with the food. There is a bowl of good fresh milk on the table. He (\"I\") drink some with a ladle. It tastes very good and refreshing. He feels thirsty. I now watch him try to talk. He is drunk or acting drunk. He has a card in his mouth to help him talk slurred. He then stands and tells the group that he loves me and he kisses me tenderly on my cheek. I think, of course, he's so affectionate, he's drunk, but I'm touched. I then see an outline of a theory written like on a blackboard. A ...........

Then I say, \"Is it OK to come see her?\" The nurse snorts derisively, \"No, of course not.\" I get angry and say, \"OK,\" then I hang up, slamming the receiver. Then I see Dora's daughter Daphne in a nurse's outfit and ask how her mom is. Daphne says she's doing better. I say, \"What's wrong with he?\" and Daphne says, \"She's getting treatment for being a child sex molester.\" I am surprised and feel sad for Daphne and shocked about Dora. I'd never imagine she'd be like that!"

I am aware that we might decide to make love. I see the kitchen and take over immediately. I am walking well and take a bag of frozen shrimp and pineapple pieces out of the refridge. I wonder why I'm being so domestic and then think, \"Oh well, he drove, so it's fair I do this.\" He is seated at the dining room table just waiting. I expertly lay the table - the two plates, the cups, the knives and forks, the two salads. He watches. I then sit to eat. He says, \"What kind of rocks are these?\" He points to a small box of rocks on the table. I sort through them and I say, \"This one is igneous. These are quartz crystal.

Finally, I have cared enough to give him this sexual gift. I sit on top of him and we have orgasm. It feels very good. Then we rest. Someone knocks on the door. I get up to open the door. He says, \"Wait! You must not. It's the police.\" Our being of different races and together is very bad and against the law. I see the heavy deadbolt locks on the door. I go hide in the bathroom.

Of course you don't want negative stuff now.\" I feel a little guilty but OK. I see pills of different sizes and shapes and I'm trying to figure out which ones to take. I ask Bridget's advice on one very ornate, flat pill as to whether it says 2 or 3 milligrams. Another pill turns out to be the manufacturer's label and another one an applique. I then find big fat ones, some green and some yellow. The 20 milligram size (like Percadans), I try to get one out and it's like taffy. I scoop it up on my finger and eat it off my finger. I think I've taken 25 milligrams. I had chocked on a \"5\" pill and it had dissolved in my throat like an aspirin with some of the sticky residue left on my finger. Bridget says, \"I know about air dynamics\" and pulls it off and throws it like a paper airplane across the room. I feel nervous because I don't know if I've had enough medicine.

I see two women in \"India\" Indian-like garb riding in a horse-drawn carriage. I'm in some other coach or something. I hop over into their carriage, and say, \"You are very pretty Indian girls.\" They are shocked and disapproving. \"Oh,\" says Cary, \"I guess you hear that a lot.\" They stop the carriage and insist he leave.

I say, \"Researching that Indian woman incident.\" I'll stay around for a few more days and do more research, ask questions, and then I'll relax and go fishing or boating. I am now standing at the edge of a shallow, high mountain lake. Water is warm. There are lots of mosquitoes and water bugs skittering around on the surface (like Hebo lake in Tilly) of the dark, dank, gray-green water. Cary Grant is already out to the deep part and calls back to the Indian woman teasingly, \"You're OK here, but I wouldn't trust your help in New York (meaning the deeper water). I'm not sure I'd hire you.\" She smiles and says, \"You miss the point.\" He says, \"What is it?\" I say, like to a mentally retarded person, \"She means she's suggesting friendship and all you see is hiring her.\" The hair on his head bursts into flames. \"Oh,\" he says, \"I'm embarrassed,\" and slowly submerges to put out the flames. She and I laugh. We wade out. I see a herd of moose with huge antlers far across the lake. They are beautiful. I remember I must feed the cats. So I have a white envelope in which I put cat food and hamburger and powdered milk. I pour water in. I repeat this several times so the cat will have enough, then I lay it on the shore of the lake.

Then in the book I am reading is a list of the training it took for the little animal (dog) to be trained. My Uncle Willis trains the animal from birth. So the list goes. Sanitary 3 1/2 weeks A. (phone #) 2\" = (only went to bathroom on floor twice). There was lots more and it was calligraphied and the huge capital letters were hand-painted. I ask my father if Uncle Willis made this book! I am impressed. My father says yes. I turn the page and see cartoons and I laugh. The first square is a car going over a cliff and lots of men grabbing at Uncle Willis, and a cow caught up innocently goes over too. The next square is a closeup of Willis in the car. Men are behind (one political party) grabbing for him and in front coming through the windshield, hands pushing him back (the other political party.) I say to my father, \"He must have been running for some political office locally.\" A small boy (3 or 4 years old) comes and stands by me and says, \"I wonder where I could buy some books for 15 cents.\" My mother who had been sleepily sitting in a chair nearby, tiredly opens her eyes and says disapprovingly and cranky, \"I wonder what you mean by that!\" (She thinks he's hinting for her to get him some books.) I put my arm around him and pull him close so he can share my book and pat him on his tummy reassuringly. My Aunt Rosalie is watching. My father says, \"Do you think it's safe to use the computer now?\" I say, \"I think so.\" I pull up to a card table near where he's working so I can companionably read and chat with him as he turns on the computer."

She's going to have a baby. We see the nursery. The living room walls are white tile with brown tile square frames. In the nursery, I see a pile of old clothes of mine I'd forgotten to move into my house. I start to go through them, finding pieces I remembered I liked. Ellie is here. Then I find a pile of little kittens and dogs that had been there for a long time. I feel badly because they've been forgotten and hadn't had food or water for too long. One little kitten's paws are deformed and they are weakened. I gather them up and take them outside. I suggest to Ellie she take the littlest kitten. She'd rather take one not so bad off, one of the white ones. I get annoyed and insist she take the littlest one. Outside, my mother pours water into a bowl and I put the kitties near it so they can drink. One puppy lies on my lap, a golden cocker spaniel type. I pet it and say, \"This one likes that. She could stay forever like this. I've got a friend for life.\" Then the puppy is a child with a British accent. I ask how long she's been abandoned by her parents. \"Eleven days,\" she says. I ask her if she wants to get back with them. She says, \"Oh, yes.\" I say, OK, we'll work on that.\""

The audience is blocked to me by a wall and I know they are there but I can't see them. I work hard to get them to respond. They finally do."

He feels uncomfortable and gets up, still talking. He gets something and returns and sits. I sit up so he can sit in the chair and I lay my head on him again. Sensual, pleasant. I was thinking he didn't like my liking our friendly contact. I turn on lights. We are now in a kitchen. Marjie Lawrence comes by. We are shocked by her appearance. She looks a little like Thea.  She wears a scarf over her head, big 1950's glasses and heavy eye makeup. She looks sick. My mother says, \"Look, here's Mabel,\" and I say, \"I didn't recognize you.\" She says, \"Yeah!\" Her eyes are giving her trouble, some disease. I see gunk on her eyes. She's trying to cover up the bad look with the scarf and glasses. She's embarrassed. She says, \"Lord! I'll probably have to talk with Jerry!\" I say, \"Shh! He's around the corner.\" She looks caught. She stands up to leave and suddenly water pours out of her, a bladder accident. She stands there, disgusted, but can't stop it so just lets it flow. A young woman walks by and stares. Mabel just shrugs her shoulders. I get up out of my wheelchair to get paper towels to help clean up. I feel good I can do this. I want to ease her embarrassment. I tell her this has happened to me before. We are cleaning up the floor and a woman says, \"Can I be of help?\" I say, \"Sure.

The curtain, which is a white burlap-like cloth, is stuck so only a portion of the stage is visible. I sit on a chair in the corner. Bonnie is with me. At the end of the song, one woman clicks her fingers and a square spotlight pops on. She hopes to get in it. Then the curtain opens up. I thought it was broken, but they had deliberately had it closed to focus on just their act. Now the scene is tables and chairs like in a cafeteria. The women borrow Mateo to be a part of the show. Bonnie is very proud. She has a magnifying glass and looks at the audience. \"Look at them,\" she says. I look. I say, \"They look like a film clip of the Nazi audiences.\" Bonnie says scornfully, \"You would see that with just your glasses.\" I feel angry at her. I look and see it is so. I again use the magnifying glass. Now I see huge people. The women then sing another song where Mateo slides on his butt across the stage. They shove him and whisper, \"Come on,\" because he's not sliding right. He whizzes past us and off the stage to the audience floor. Bonnie is very angry and gets up in a huff. She won't stay here any longer after that! I sit her down and hold her shoulders and say, \"Stop it. You are being too sensitive.\" She huffs off. Some women students are walking past me to go to the audience. One pushes her program into my face, across my eyes. I grab her hand and pull it away sharply. \"That hurts my eyes,\" I say. \"Oh, it's just a soft piece of paper,\" she says. \"It gave me a paper cut,\" I reply. She apologizes. A guy comes out on stage and does a monologue to some women in the audience. They come up on stage. They are \"planted\" student actors. One woman takes my seat because she's tired. I stand there, wondering if I can manage. I see a picture that is funny. Two pages with a hole cut out of the top one so my top half is superimposed on the bottom half of another picture. It's my back. I am in the wheelchair. The bottom half is a little girl on a tricycle. I think it looks strange. A student (woman) is late and says, \"Start the scene without me.

I take a taste and then explain, \"I can't eat those kinds of foods because if it's scratchy or spicy, it could cause my throat to spasm.\" I suggest we drape the table with black fur. They then push the table out to the edge of the cliff that overlooks the sea. The young man is very young, like in high school, and yet he owns this huge house by the sea. He houses lots of children that are homeless. He makes his money by collecting things and selling them. I comment that I tried photography and did pretty well, and after I fix my camera, I'll do it again. I remember I'd always wanted to have a relationship with a photographer but this guy, although he really likes me, is far too young. I see a picture of a baby's face and it unfolds to become a woman's face. I am very surprised. I look at the waves and see a Conestoga wagon from years past being washed up on shore. I tell the young man so he can collect it and make lots of money. There are lots of younger children around us. We take care of them and care about them. Now, I'm looking out the window at the sea. He stands next to me and says he really likes me. Maybe if I wanted, he could grow up and we'd marry. I smile sadly. I say, \"That's very sweet, but unrealistic. I am 45 years old\" (I was embarrassed to tell him how old I was). He pauses...45!...but he accepts it. I move away, feeling sad. A woman friend comes to talk to me. She tells me that \"Dwight\" has completed my rooms, so we go to look. I had found a wonderful old wooden wardrobe with lots of books in it and got it cheap for only $30 dollars and Dwight was going to build a room to put it in. My woman friend takes me to the door, which opens two ways. We go out to a quiet, austere room with bunk beds and lots of books - I suspect this is Dwight's room - and into my bedroom. He chose aqua marine green as the color, flowered curtains and a bedspread like in (Agatha Christie's Room). I say, \"Oh, no books.\" My woman friend says, \"Oh well, the Road Master chose not to build bookcases.\" \"Well, we'll see about that,\" I say. I am not upset. I just know there's a reasonable explanation. I peek into a small, adjoining room. It's a dressing room. All my clothes are hung on special racks I can easily reach and there are hand rails so I can stand supported. I smile. He thinks of everything. I try on a dress. \"Oh! How fat I look,\" I moan, upset. The friend tells me to not be worried, just be what I am. We rearrange the long sash and then I see five or six pink beautiful dresses that are all alike, hanging up. I say, \"Oh! these dresses. Just in case there's a wedding.\" I wink, hoping she takes it as a joke, but I realize I'm serious. One of the dresses is for a small flower girl. I look back to the bedroom and see a window. I look out and see a flowered courtyard. To the right is a huge picture window. \"That's a lucky person,\" I say. Then, in the room I see a door. \"Is this the exit?\" I say. I walk through into a kitchen. I realize then that he's built me a complete suite. The cupboards are the right height and depth for me to easily reach things. Only the foods I like are on the shelf: pizzas, cans of hamburger casserole, \"corn chip brand panty hose.\" I go around the corner and see my picture window and, of course, all my books! I go out into the courtyard, only it's a sort of garden room, \"where you can have a party if you want,\" he says. I walk to him and hug him. He is grown now and the right height. My woman friend tells me he's really older than I thought. He'd actually dropped out of high school for some years to build up his business, so he's more like 25 or 26. It's still pretty young, but more acceptable. I am so grateful and touched that he provided so accurately for my every whim and desire. We are just standing there close and feeling love and being loved. (Insert scene after photography session.) The table becomes a circus train. The woman friend is up in the engine car on the passenger side. Dwight is the engineer. Then he becomes the Head Family Man, the boss that orchestrates the details of keeping this family together. A married woman is being promiscuous and I see her coupled sexually with a midget. Dwight tells her to stop."

My husband has a hurt foot and he leans on the son and they race together like in a 3-legged race. I watch and feel good at their moment of closeness. Then my husband releases the son, who goes outside and I watch in a growing horror as my husband prepares and then dies. He uses a white wire coat hanger, with the hook cut off, to stab himself in the forehead. I wonder how he can stand the pain. Then he pours gasoline on the wire hanger and lights it. I realize he's going to burn himself to death. The flame slowly goes up the hanger and catches to his hair. I wonder at his taking such a slow, painful death. Surely there are easier ways! Finally he is consumed in flames and falls over stiff and charred. I go to him and feel the stiffness of his arms. Then I succumb to intense sadness and mourning. I weep and refuse to leave the house for weeks. We are in a new house, a new town, and I know no one and don't search anyone out. After several weeks, an older man comes to the door. I open the door and look out at the neighborhood. I see a small store (grocery) nearby. It all looks pleasant. The man invites me to friendship, but I refuse. He leaves.

I see a huge, beautiful crystal on a table near my door. I admire it. Bonnie is there. Then Nate comes in. I am so glad to see him. We look at each other longingly. Bonnie goes and gets the van. She drives. Nate and I hug and lay down on the bench. It is so sexually exciting. I am throbbing in anticipation, but worried about if he has AIDS, is he still married, and is he still an alcoholic? We talk. Then we're at the movie house. It's the same one we were last together at. We enter through tiny door holes in the wall. Bonnie and Nate go ahead. I enter and see racked seating and can't locate them in the crowd. Then I see Bonnie waving at me. I'd walked too far in, so I back track and go to them. She was seated next to him but moves over so I sit beside him, between them."

She and Phyllis are talking and I don't want to interrupt them, but it is important to tell Hasani so she won't go out like that and be embarrassed. I interrupt and they both look at the strings, which now looks like parachute pants legs that had been stuck together with a wad of gum. They clean the gum off and then they leave. Just as soon as they leave, I fall into a sleep and see purple images before my eyes. I feel sensual. It is pleasant. Then I see the faces of a man and woman kissing and I sigh and say, \"I want that now. Yes I do.\" I really feel sad and wanting. Then I fall deeper into the sleep. I am aware of Hasani's image or spirit just behind my right shoulder. The room has changed. There are painted flowers or strawberries on the walls. I am curious about why this room. It is unknown to me. Then I feel waves of feelings sweep over me like a rush of goosebumps and become very still. I realize the spirits are in me to do the healing. I see a man enter the room, wearing black clothes, good-looking in a slick, Mexican way. Someone says, \"Here is the devil. He has come too.\" I think, \"I don't want the devil.\" So I called to the good spirits, the white light, and brought in more of them. My left leg slid off the bed and my foot was on the floor. I was a little afraid because the devil might be there, but I was paralyzed. I wanted to swallow but could not. I felt the spirits in my throat, healing it. I felt them all through my body. I saw giant cells and realized the spirits were in my DNA changing the coding so my arthritis would go away. I was pleased and in awe and observing all this while I was awake, but also aware that I was asleep and dreaming. I stayed with it as long as I could to get the most healing out of it."

One photo is a composite where a picture of a baby was cut out and pasted on this photo and has something to do with why I became visible as a small fairy."

I see photos done by the cosmetic/drug company that sponsors my talks, pictures of the customers in pretty clothes and flower corsages. Then I read about his father, but can't quite follow it all (on different pages, etc.). I have to go to the bathroom and go up to my bedroom. Arvonne goes by and I tell her of how I dreamed about Brian K and how he looked at me [a dream within a dream]. She leaves and I wonder why she's still around. I figure this is her last day. It is 11:00 and I get up out of bed and go upstairs. Now I'm at an outdoor cafe and I sit. I see across the courtyard Paul (Brian K). I want to impress him, so I take a small child and dance around, in my wheelchair. I am attracting everyone's attention. I am so graceful and playful.

Then I'm out and scrambling. I see a log and a stream and realize my father is dead. I try to hide, but am forced back to the house. More horrible men. The place is crawling with them. Then I see an opportunity and sneak out to a hedge and crawl in. Soldiers walk past me in the hedge and I crouch and hide, narrowly missing being discovered time and time again. Their movements past me causes my pretty chiffon peach-colored dress to fan out and I pull it back in, hoping no one saw it. Other girls and boys are hiding in there and are found. I am near a cooking soldier and he almost discovers me. Then I see the tide is coming up and I soon can slip out to sea. I dive into the black water. They hear me and come in after me. I swim underwater for a long time with strong strokes. I know I'm swimming to my death, but it is preferable to the death and dishonor on shore. Then I hear a humming motor sound and I feel cautiously good. I go up to surface. It is an American sub. I swim to it. It's on the verge of attack and may be in danger, but it stops and a small lock is revealed. I turn the lock and open a small space. I am sad to see it isn't a porthole or hatch. I keep frantically digging. They take pity on me inside and open a hatch to a storage area full of iron boards, ropes and things. I dig in and the hatch closes and it's dark and nearly airless, but I know I've at least got a chance to survive here. (I wake up scared.)"

The guy thinks it would be interesting to hang out for a while, so he plays and they swing from ropes and climb things. The fallen guy sees a woman's image and mourns. He hopes she's a good woman and she and her husband are in love. It's rare these days. And then he misses his family who must be mourning his loss. Then the crazy guys shoots lots of arrows at a tree-like thing near him, narrowly missing him. The crazy guy laughs and laughs. The fallen guy goes and grabs the arrows and throws some down out of the cavern and breaks some. That makes the crazy guy angry. \"What did you do that for?\" he asks. Then the falling guy teases the crazy guy into a \"can't catch me\" game. They both sit on sharp holes like conical ant hills or ends of tree branches and laugh. They are naked and the crazy guy gets a hard-on and laughs and runs back to the knobby branch. He's excited by the dangerous undertones in the game. He wonders briefly if he's homosexual and decides he's not. Then the game stops. The falling guy is lonesome and decides to return to his family. He says goodbye and starts to climb up the subway/sewer-like tunnel ladder. This enrages the crazy guy who entices him back to his camp area and tells him he has to crawl into a cocoon device and the crazy guy will lock it up. The falling guy doesn't want to, but approaches it cautiously, saying \"Do I hear a voice of someone you've already trapped there?\" I worry he will go in there and can't believe it when he does! How stupid to voluntarily trap yourself. I wonder at his reasons and get the feeling that it's because the crazy guy has a gun, and if he refuses it would be certain death. At least as long as he's alive, there's hope for escape. So he gets in the cocoon like it's a cradleboard; his hands, arms and legs are bound inside. For days the crazy guy is cruel to him, sometimes feeding him, etc. The falling guy says in an embarrassed tone, \"I've messed my dress and there's a couple of spots sorted with BM, can you clean me up?\" The crazy guy laughs cruelly. The falling guy tries to hang his butt end over the cliff to defecate without messing on himself, but one slip and he'd fall. His balance is precarious. Then he struggles for the key and gets it in his mouth and accidentally swallows it. He grimaces and says, \"I can't believe I did that!\" Now they are both in trouble. Somehow the crazy guy tires of the game and thinks about moving on to another place under the city and getting other \"playmates.\" It is possible the falling guy will be released and return to his loving family."

I walk down a path looking for a way back to the freeway, but only see a dirt path and then a driveway up to someone's nice house. I smile at Sharon and shrug my shoulders, deciding to go through with it after all, since I can't find a way out. As I walk into the community room, I ask her what I need to be doing to help. She says, \"Tie 15,000 tobacco ties!\" I say, surprised, \"15,000?\" and repeat that, shaking my head in wonder! I enter the room to see the tables and chairs all set up: square tables for four. I drive my wheelchair to the back of the room and move a chair out of my way by bulldozing with my wheelchair. An Indian boy comes up, one of several that had been running and playing on the steps when I arrived and look like Theresa's boys! He says to me I shouldn't move things around to suit myself like that. I say, \"Oh well. I like to sit in the back where I can get out quick if I need to.\" I then look longingly at the front where I would be able to see the expensive things better. Then people come in and a couple of ugly old farts (businessmen) sit at my table. I'm cutting pies up into 8ths and wrapping them. They make negative comments about women's places. They are rusty, traditional men. Two of the worst decide they are attracted to me. I laugh and start singing a song about \"just my luck!\" This one likes me and then Mr. R comes up and says he likes me. I skip over to my apartment building to change clothes, singing this song, and I follow myself watching. I feel the possible threat of a man (crazy) attacking her/me but keep thinking, \"No. that won't happen,\" and see a crazy man who avoids my eye contact, and I keep moving out of the building back toward the church."

I kind of enjoyed the experience. I didn't get angry. I was clear and articulate. Then later she starts talking and I raise my hand to answer a question. She ignores me and finally I stand up and go right up to the front of the class, right in her face. She has to call on me. She doesn't like it."

I say, \"No, I don't, none to give anyway.\" They smirk and leave. I get up and go to the door, carrying the baby. It's dark and cloudy out there and ominous. Snarling dogs are up and down the street. Snarling squirrels try to bite at me through the old, nasty screen door. Those men are lounging on my lawn, waiting. I say, \"I'm not afraid. I know what to do.\" I shut the door and lock it and look hurriedly for other doors to lock. I see a long closed-in hall (tunnel like) and refuse to walk through it, too scary. I go upstairs and I see an unlocked door and hear them opening it. I tiptoe up the attic stairs, stepping over clothes and games. I hear them tiptoeing behind me. I am scared. I see a pad and crawl under it and under a second layer and I curl up, waiting and hoping they don't find me. They paw around the pad but don't unearth the second layer. They are standing very close to me. I can hardly breathe."

I rush back to get my baby and her high chair and I grouse angrily that at least they'd have helped me put that in baggage.

He gave me curt directions on how I should dance. It was a romantic song (Endless Love or something) and I was to kiss his hand just so. I felt silly because he'd hand me her hand.

And I am surprised and say to someone, \"You mean that when we had pre-play parties and went with our friends to the play, we created a tradition and everyone remembers us?\" \"Yep,\" agrees someone. Then I'm in a 1950's formal. The door bell rings, guests arrive. It's a reunion. I act as hostess and welcome my parents' now old friends and take them into the piano room and offer them refreshments. I am a charming hostess. I welcome Mrs. Cinquint, an old school teacher. I hug her and say, \"I remember you! I was a small child.\" She admires how I've grown up. Another family friend and her family comes to the door. She sits on the huge, empty porch floor with her presents. She says to my mother, \"I brought you presents, but I can't stay, so let's open them here. The room's empty except for a tiny Christmas tree and a swing set her kids are playing on. My father calls to me to attend the guests. I go into the piano room and mingle. I approach two guys in tuxedos. I say, \"What can I bring you?\" I am aware of a young, good-looking man watching me, enjoying me. One guy says, \"I want a this ___________,\" a name of a stomach medicine. I laugh and say, \"OK, coming up.\" The next guy, who I realize is gay, asks for some fingernail polish. He says, \"I heard you don't wear any.\" I smile and say, \"It's true. I don't own any.\" He says, \"But what if you get a run in your stockings.\" I say, \"I don't wear stockings.\" This is pleasantly arousing to the young man watching. I walk past where he's seated in an overstuffed armchair and talk with a woman who is attempting to compose a poem with an old silly song. As I tease her, the young man pulls my leg until I fall into his lap. We laugh and tease about the song, and then he picks me up and we go to a corner in the room and sit. He's cuddling me and it is very nice. I say, \"I must get back to my guests,\" but he won't let me and I don't struggle very hard. I like where I am."

She (Ru) says, \"See the new floor covering?\" It's a flower print linoleum. I am amazed her family completely transformed her room in just a short time - yellow and white fluffy curtains, matching bed spread, lots of ruffles. It's pretty. I go to my room (like a dorm or hospital) and notice I have paint and am relieved. It's easier to do than wallpaper. I sit in my bed and am putting white pearl nail polish on my left thumbnail. A nurse comes in and wants me to apply a jelly-like substance to my \"infected (affected) area,\" the vagina (the jelly is like diaphragm jelly!). Instead, I wipe yellow diarrhea off my butt and then put the jelly on the vagina. Before I did this, I asked a nurse to pull the blinds. She was incompetent and couldn't follow my directions."

It is telling me I'm going to have a good relationship with the guy opposite me, a nice quiet family man. I am, of course, quite shocked to be having an angel talking to me and can't concentrate on my job. The little wine glasses jiggle and tremble and I spill wine in the tray. He helps me clean it up. As we walk back up the aisle, he helps me carry the tray so we don't spill anymore. We go to the kitchen area and pour off the spilt wine in a cup. I suggest we take it to the vestry as it is blessed wine. Then we go to the handshaking line and its too late, everyone's gone through (we are supposed to stand with the minister and shake hands with the departing people), so he starts typing a letter. I see a small 4-month-old baby. I go over and pick it up and cuddle it. An 8-year-old girl sees me and says I don't mind if she's going to be with my daddy, but she doesn't have to pick up the baby without permission! I didn't hear her and I go to the man and say, \"Look at this cute baby.\" The man grins because it's his baby. I say, \"You can hold it. I hope it isn't afraid of you. I'll finish typing the letter and you hold the baby.\" He agrees. As I'm typing, or trying to, the girl comes up to her daddy and says, \"It's OK. I like her.\" He shushes her, embarrassed, and I did hear this time and now realize what's going on. He suggests we finish at his house, as he's cooking a turkey and doesn't know how, maybe I could help?"

So I started writing the story on leftover paper, writing in the patches between other words. Millie comes over and starts to read it. I ask to see hers. She says, \"No. It's not very good. Not like yours. Look at your first sentence. It's so clear, and you spent last night with those Indians, too.\" She meant I'd been busy babysitting some active boys and didn't have time to work on the story."

We go upstairs and move to seats very close to another Indian man who is preparing his instrument. I am equally attracted to him and go closer. He has a guitar with a printer in it. Other objects are attached to it to make unusual music. I say to my friend, \"Look, He has a large mosquito tied to a string.\" It hums and he amplifies it when it's appropriate. Unique instruments. Later, my dancing friend and I are in a car. He's in the driver's seat and we're about to drive away. (I'm in the passenger seat.) I look out the window and see a two-story house with windows that roll down like car windows and most of them are open. I see two huge bears (grizzlies) starting to get out the windows. I tell my Indian man and he gets out to stop them. I see the two bears followed by a dog running away. In the sky are a helicopter and several planes. I begin to cry, left all alone in the car. I keen and lament, \"I've lost everything I've ever loved.\" My two beautiful Indian men are gone. I weep uncontrollably. [BL]"

I am aware of my informal clothes. I ask my mother what's going on. She says, \"We're getting ready to divide up Grandma Mildred and Pa Lloyd's things.\" I ask if everyone will be there, even Aunt Millie. \"Oh yes,\" she says. \"Aunt Millie said she'd be here later.\" We go to the dining room and look for our place tags. I see mine with the package of my \"portion\" of things. It's a plastic bag like a sandwich bag. I open it to see four baby outfits in it. I'm a little disappointed. I look again to see they're changed, to four bras. Then I see a picture of Aunt Millie when she was in high school. I see only half of her face and I say, \"She looks angry\" (see drawing)."

Now, we're in an old rickety house and this woman, a man, and my brother Dwight are going to help me build it up from the falling down, ugly condition. I point to a solid rock wall and the man says, \"It will be easy to build a staircase in it.\" I say, \"But for why? Where would it go?\" He decides to build a fireplace. He's painting the kitchen in the \"bar\" room. He sees that we have a lot of kitchens. I say, \"Well, we need them. This one, in the bar room will be used for the customers. The center one will be for family and the one outside for the cattle hired hands in the summer when we raise 100 head of cattle.\" The house is built into a mountain and under a huge cement bridge. The country is too rough to graze cattle. The house keeps improving. It's starting to look good and solid. (see drawing)"

I walk past a field of corn, touching the plants as I walk by. Then I'm near an empty field on a mowed down path and the sky is brown. The clouds are roiling around and I'm scared. That is the worst storm sky I've ever seen and I could get struck by lightning, out in the open like that. I keep walking fast, hoping to find safe cover in time or to somehow avoid the storm."

I'm going to lecture on Art In Spain. Each candy as I eat it creates like a slide show. I see one that shows the structure of a miniature house as it's being built. I'm glad because this will be good history to present in the show. I look for the number of that candy so I can find it again. I see two numbers. (see drawing). The first number is tied to a stick figure reindeer, so I choose the second number. I'm not prepared but it's time for the show. I feel nervous stage fright. Why do I keep doing this, I wonder? I go into the auditorium. There is a small crowd, maybe half a house. Oh well. I sit perpendicular to the audience and look at the stage. I see two red posters with words on it: my props. My mother and Ellie sit in the front row, in front of me, as I am actually facing the side of the audience (see drawing). My mother hands me folders of poems of a famous poet in case I want to quote him, to fill in time, or for contrast. Then the first act is on and my mother and Ellie are talking very loudly. I am embarrassed. Two black people, a man, standing and a woman sitting, are laughing loud and long. I think, \"Uh, oh, tough audience.\" Then suddenly I can't see. I can't force my eyes open. I struggle and struggle, nearly panicked. I'd get one open a bit and be convinced things weren't where they were supposed to be. I saw the wheelchair I was sitting in, in front of me. I saw my own arm like it was up against my eye. (When I woke, it was.) I saw dry ice clouds and the four bright yellow and white machines making the fog to the right. I feel afraid and continue to try and force my eyes open. My mother stands up and walks to me. I say, \"I can't see.\" She touches my eyes and examines them. She says there's a skin layer grown over the lids, holding them down (like scar tissue). She pulls it off. I can now see out of one eye occasionally. I still struggle.

The audience is getting restless. I'm embarrassed I keep apologizing, \"I don't know why I am having so much trouble.\" I realize I should have just had the proper pages separated and marked. Somehow I know I did that, but It's not working anyway. A woman in the audience plays a guitar to keep everyone entertained. I am grateful to her and think, \"What good thinking. How nice of her. How fortunate for me she did that.\" Names of the poets are Fred Mann, Locke, Sharp. A woman poet writes about children. The older man who is paying me to do the lecture suggests we take a short break. I am relieved because that will give me time to get it together. He's annoyed at me. I leave the room to find the bathroom. As I'm walking down a sidewalk, Darryl/Tom walks up to me. I feel a sad/excited feeling wash over me. He asks if he can talk to me as we walk. I agree and keep walking. He seems shy and hesitant. I know he's going to apologize and try to get back together with me and I want him to because I've missed him, and I don't want him to because he hurt me badly and he probably hasn't changed. He stands very close to me and I feel like I can't breathe well from need of his love. I back away. He follows. We are standing by a grand piano. I walk so that he is now facing me with the piano between us. He says,\"I love you. I want to get together again. Is there any chance?\" I feel like crying. I want to melt into his arms and hug him and feel loved. I keep repeating in my head, \"Don't do it. Don't believe him.\" I say, \"You hurt me so bad. I loved you and you went away. I was so lonely, even when I was with you.\" He is contrite and waits. I now continue walking to find the bathroom. He follows, hoping. I am torn. Now the older man, semi-bald, comes up and walks with me. He says, \"Will you take a picture of me?\" He hands me his camera, a (see drawing) slim, 35 mm camera. I say, \"Sure.\" \"You are so kind to do this.\" He smiles. He's in focus, but someone walks by and I move the camera, and now it's out of focus. I fiddle with the focus lens and the man says, \"My daughter was raped.\" I gasp, \"How awful\" \"Yes,\" he says, \"Did you get her professional help?\" \"No,\" he says. \"I'm a counselor,\" I smile, apologetic to explain my intensity. \"I have a bias that people are helped by counseling.\" The man thinks about it, but I know he's not convinced. Several people are standing around, wanting to walk by, but waiting for me to take the picture. I get it in focus. The man smiles big and I snap it.

I suggest he pay rent. \"How much?\" he asks. \"$100 apiece,\" I say (he has a friend). I am very pleased with myself that I would get more money than I'm putting out and therefore make a profit."

Finally  says, \"Let's kiss.\" I say, \"OK, but don't rush it.\" This is important because if I don't like the kiss, I won't want a relationship with him and I don't want to ruin the chance because I do like him and I've been lonely for a long time. I want to have a relationship. So we kiss; it's not the best, but acceptable.

Now we're married and I am sort of in Danny and sort of watching him. The woman/me is now Faye Dunaway. She's a total bitch. We live in the beautiful mansion, wonderfully furnished rooms, many stories high, room after room. Danny hides from me because all I do is yell, complain and speak in a harsh, angry voice. I am vacuuming. Danny and his male friend tiptoe past me going from room to room looking for a place to relax where she won't find them. Danny carries a tiny tabby kitten who is sweet, lively and curious. He/me pets the kitten. We are followed by the sound of the vacuum and her angry voice yammering. We go from room to room. We pause at the exercise room. Danny says, \"She'd never come in this room,\" but we hear the relentless sound of the vacuum cleaner coming toward us. We accidentally knock off the handle and struggle, slightly panicked to get the door open. We do it and go on down the hall. We find an elevator but decide to use the stairs so she won't hear the elevator. We go to the roof area and get in a swimming pool. Danny lays down in the shallow water, his friend lays sort of on him, between his legs, both facing up like they were sunning. The pool is filled to overflowing with Japanese men. The kitten wants to wander on and Danny lets go of it and it goes on to play elsewhere. Faye Dunaway and her maid are standing in a window a story above the pool and looks out and sees Danny. Caught. Danny's stomach feels tight from \"fear\" or discomfort but he kind of gives up and continues sunning in the pool. Faye's face is full of hatred and anger."

I say, \"Open the door so we can swim out before we drown.\" The driver opens the door and we get out. Lucy is afraid. I reassure her. We paddle toward shore, which is close by. I notice the water is muddy and I then stand. The water is only waist deep; there is no danger after all. Then, someone says, \"Look! A water fall,\" and they all go wading down the shoreline toward a thunderous, huge water fall. I say, \"Oh, oh\" because I will follow them and don't feel comfortable about wading in unknown muddy water. I could step in a deep hole and be in trouble, but I go anyway. Now it's a highway again that ends at a cliff edge that is glassed in. We stand and look down to see this waterfall. The people are in my way and now the glass wall is only 3' high and down a slope.

He's been waiting, because most of the women get confused or angry and leave. He says to someone, \"I'll make her my wife.\" He calls me in and gives me his proposition. We will marry but it will not involve sex, merely a marriage of convenience. I think about it. He seems a nice enough guy and agree. But then he changes his mind. I shrug and smile and say, \"Oh well, is this the way I get back?\" He is impressed that I take it so good-naturedly and don't demand money for the return trip home. I start walking back. He follows. I stop and look at the beautiful bay and the ocean. I admire a furry animal as it scurries through the marsh grass. I ask if this is an island and if that man has the only return boats. I find a \"delivery service\" building and go in to get a ticket. The man comes up to me. He's short, too short, I think, so I make him taller, but he's a few inches shorter than me. I shrug. It's good enough. He tells me, \"The clock tells good time but it is always one minute fast.\" He made the clock. It never sold well. It has an ornate sculpture of the mountains and coast. I examine it and then pepper him with questions because I can see ways he can improve the clock and make it a better seller. He has, as usual, cluttered things up unnecessarily. He's very impressed with my enthusiasm, good sense and persistence. He decides he does want to marry me. Now we're in the back seat of his chauffeur-driven, black, older car. The window is down and we are hanging our heads but looking at the scenery as it goes by, almost like a dog does, the wind flapping in our faces. The man tells me that he has two brothers. I see one, Rod Taylor, good looking and young, and realize this will make a good story if I fall in love with him while I'm married to the older, duller brother. The man says the man his mother married wasn't the father of any of the kids. The mother went out and had three different affairs with strangers off the streets and had three different kids. The man she was married to raised all the kids as his own. Then my \"husband\" said, \"I've only told 12 people this story and you're the only one I've told it all to.\" I nod and say, \"I am honored.\" We have a grudging sense of caring and respect for each other."

I stand up and hug him feeling his great love all around me. I relax into his embrace. Then a small girl comes into the room crying for her \"Linda mom.\" She had awakened afraid and had walked out to find \"Linda Mamma,\" even though she was afraid to leave her bed. I let go of \"Hector\" and pick up the girl. I hug her and say, \"Linda Mom left, I'm the only one here. I'll have to do.\" She's sad, so I show her the bed that \"Linda Mom\" used to sleep on. It is piled high with laundry. Now \"Hector\" is back in the living room playing an Italian accordion squeeze box. Now there are two little girls and I dance with them. The littlest one dances between my legs as I hold her arms."

Then, I see cousins, Marci and some small boys. I see Aunt Rosalie and Uncle Gus. At least I think it's him and wonder to myself, \"If he was the one that abused me, wouldn't I know it by feeling bad or strange around him?\" He and Rosalie are seated on the next hospital bed, Rosalie sitting up, and he relaxed and semi-reclining. I chat with the small boy cousins and ask their names. Then a nurse comes in to prep me and asks what meds I've taken. She then says, \"You can't have your surgery today. You'll have to wait until tomorrow.\" The next day I'm going back to the hospital. Dwight is there and a small baby girl 1 and 1/2 or 2 years old. We are behind a marching band. I say, \"We should hold her hand.\" Dwight holds her left hand and an older man in the band holds her right hand. I feel a little guilty that I don't hold her hand. We are holding up the last part of the parade and I suggest we drop back to the last place. We do. I suggest the man go on with the band and I hold her hand, but he wants to keep hold of her hand. As we walk down the hall, I ask Dwight how his litter of puppies are. \"Which ones?\" he says. \"The really ugly ones with the wrinkled faces?\" He says, \"They're in the barn, doing OK.\" He'll sell them soon. I get into the hospital bed and the nurse comes to set up my IV."

I try to pet it, but it's just out of reach. It's gray and cute. I finally touch it. As we go to the car, it runs under and I say to my brother Jake, \"Oh, get the kitty out of there before we go; I don't want us to run over it.\" Jake smirks and makes some sarcastic remark about squished kitty. I repeat my concern to my father. Everyone gets in, including some new boy (2 years old), like my nephew Rodney. I say, \"Uh oh, now is there room for me?\" Someone (Dwight) says, \"I'll put him on my lap.\" I'm the last one to get in because it's easier for me to get in the passenger seat. I get in and I realize I can't reach out and get the door to shut it. My father starts driving. I say, \"I can't get the door shut.\" My client Theresa crawls over everyone and me to come up front to help. My father's looking for a place to slow down. She reaches around to my right on the outside of the car where the gas tank cap is and I say, \"No, not there, on the door.\" She then reaches a gas tank-like cap she has out to fit it into the recessed hole that exactly matches the configuration of the cap and carefully moves it until it clinks in and then she pulls the door shut. Now we've arrived at the town. It's our new town that I've been so happy about and as we drive I realize I've made a mistake. I'm a teenager and all the stores have toys and amusements for children, which will be great for the kids, but I'll soon be bored and then there will be nothing for me. I see western town store fronts too. I start lamenting, \"Oh, no. There's no one here for me. This is awful.\" Now we're walking across a huge field toward our house and I'm saying over and over, \"I've made a terrible mistake. There will not be anyone for me here.\" My mother (young and helpful) shows me the two agate/stone teardrop shaped necklaces I've given her for good luck and says, \"See, I've still got these on.\" A huge community marching band is preparing to practice for a parade. There are hundreds of people, many teenagers. We accidentally walk through them. As I'm looking around, I am still lamenting, \"No one for me, a bad mistake.\" We are then surrounded by the marching/milling crowd. I see a woman in a wheelchair with huge back wheels, decorated. I'm annoyed with her. She nearly pushed me aside. I see young men pretending to be Indians on horseback. One has a flaming arrow, but the flame goes out too soon. My father points out a circle on a sign, like an Indian hoop, but it's an auto tire with tools glued to it to advertise a local car repair shop. We get through the people and now I see our new house. We go in. It's isolated and in the country. It's miles from town. The first room is a kitchen, and kind of messy. We're (my mother and I) looking out a window. I see nothing but grass (no crops). I then notice out the back window the shadowy shape of a big brown owl-like bird. \"Oh,\" I say, \"an owl.\" He flies around to the window we're at and lands right on the sill and we look at each other. He has ordinary bird eyes. Then he flies away. I go to the back window and look out. I see a creek. I say, \"Look! We have our own creek.\" I'm thinking it might be fun to swim and wade in the summer, but then I notice mosquitoes all over the surface and tadpoles in the water. It didn't look so inviting. The bank on the other side goes up steeply, and there is not much space to run and play. There are hardly any trees. Now my mother and I go to the next room. \"What's this?\" I ask. \"One of those 'dining room things.'\" I'm not impressed. We go into the next room.

We go from room to room, amazed at how many there are and how nice and spacious and pretty they are. We are called to look at the \"play\" room. We go in. Some of the kids have the couch made out to a hideaway bed. I see a piano but it has some keys missing. Then my father says, \"Look at this!\" with excitement. I look. It's a player piano. I'm so happy, just like at Grandma Agnes'. He points to the music roll and I see very ornate notation. The classics! Very unusual and complicated for a player piano. Then, I see there are two player pianos. I see another hideaway bed. It's not in very good shape. My father says, \"The kids have already decided this one's for guests we don't like.\" I laugh. I see a back staircase and a tiny bathroom. It only has a toilet. I then notice the stairs are all flat and down, but if you push a button they pop up into usable stairs. I think, \"That would be dangerous if someone at the top was coming down and someone didn't know it and pushed the button. They'd have quite a fall.\""

It has three round tables, and an uphill slanted dance floor. There is an old organ you put tape cassettes into and a short dusty bar. I ask someone if I should tear it down. They'd like me to keep it and fix it up. I think maybe I will and tear down another building in worse shape. I go to the organ and pull out a few stops. It sighs a few notes. I find a drawer with tapes in them. I pull one out. It says, \"Barb Sanders,\" and a form of Darryl is there. There are other names too. I put it in. It plays organ music and in the background our voices are talking from long ago. I can't make out what we're saying and lose interest. I open another drawer and see children's and babies clothing. I hold up a doll's head that has red hair, curly. I show it to Sonja and say she can keep it to use when she's explaining to people how she doesn't like to explain about her red hair all the time. I give it to her and for a moment, I think it looks like a shrunken head. Ugh. I pull out a huge yellow outdoor suit with feet in it and show it to Sonja.

Mateo wants to go home. He's tired and annoyed. There's just a small amount left, a big roast pan and lots of catsup bottles on the table. I look out a window and see a bright red fake fur pony and a small devil. I am struck with how total and bright the color red is. The TV camera goes in for a close-up to the devil's teeth. I think, \"How amazing, he has my father's teeth!\" They are slightly crooked in (the opposite of mine). I am drawn to these teeth. I think they are very handsome ones. The camera pulls out and now he's a very good-looking man on the soap opera General Hospital, and they do extreme close-ups of him because he's so compellingly handsome with those movie star teeth. They don't do such extreme close-ups to the other men; they aren't as attractive or seductive looking. Now the camera crew is calling different operating rooms to get their reaction to the show. So we're looking into an operating room. I see the patient and the nurses who answer the questions about the soap opera as they work. I think, \"It's a lucky thing the patient didn't have complications while the show was on! The nurses wouldn't have noticed and the patient could have died!\" The nurses only had favorable remarks about the new style of extreme close-ups with this one man. Now I'm a patient and am feeling the drowsy narcotic effects of post-op thinking, \"I feel good now, but later this will hurt and be fearful and yucky. So for now, just enjoy the good feeling of stupor and well being.\" Bonnie comes by to see how I'm doing. (After I wake up, I think the phrase, \"I walk on my dreams.\")"

Now, I feel a little trapped because I want to order Kentucky Fried Chicken, but I don't want to have the expense of buying for all of us. I think maybe I'll only buy a three-piece meal and share it. I am aware vaguely that I'm being mean-spirited and ungenerous, but I resent having to pay so much, especially since it would have been so much cheaper to have Ellie cook up something. I would have done it myself except for my arthritis, so I feel trapped by my disability as well as my ineffective mothering skills with Ellie or my powerlessness to get her to behave. I see Richard Dreyfuss up in a loft area and think, \"So, the movie has started. They skipped the first part...good.\" Dovre tells me she and the neighbor woman spent all last night \"cross-dressing.\" She thought it was kind of kinky and weird, but was bored and so she went along with it. She's not too thrilled. She's still bored. Now we go next door. The neighbors are having a party. Dovre's ex-boyfriend shows up (still Dwight) and wants to see her. Dovre and I are surprised to see him. She's curious what he wants to say, but she doesn't want to talk to him. The neighbor woman says she'll talk to him and they go outside (we're in a kind of guest house, recreation room that hasn't really got walls, just the framing studs are up). I watch the woman and Dwight and wish I could listen in on their conversation, so a woman creeps up with a camera and mike and pretends to read a book lying down on her belly. The book is covering the mike. I'm bored with the current group of guests; they're all vacuous and ditsy. I see a pile of boxes and remember I had stored some of Dovre's and my things there. I start looking through the boxes. I find audio tapes of the Star Spangled Wash Board band's last concert and I remember I was bored with it because they did only their old material. There was no new stuff. I see video tapes of Harry Meets Sally (staring Richard Dreyfuss). I hear Claude talking in a bored way and remember he was married at last year's party and this year he's not terribly interested in me. I find photos I had taken of the wedding, or rather the reception after. I took a portrait shot of each guest. I want to keep those because I notice some of the poses are interesting; they were better than I'd remembered them (in terms of \"arty\" photography). I see a letter to Dovre from one of her girlfriends. It's a love letter and shows a drawing of a naked woman lying seductively on her side. Only her back shows. The letter says, \"Could you consider loving me this way?\" I think, \"Huh, Dovre had a lesbian pass made at her too.\" I tell Dovre she'd better get her stuff as I'm taking mine. She shrugs and says, \"I don't want it.\" I say, \"Well then, throw it away.\" She says, \"No, I want to keep it. Let it stay here.\" I say, \"That's rude. They need their space, it will make a nice addition to their room. We need to find our own place to store it.\" She's not too happy, but agrees. I point to the letter and she says she's not interested in it and goes on."

I put the crook of my finger in the breast pocket of the coat of one of them. He looks at me strangely. I say, \"Sorry, I just wanted to be connected.\" I try several other spots and choose a watch chain like thing that seems OK with him. We continue walking. I see the building, \"Lyons Building,\" right next to the Music Co. Building. I say, \"Here we are.\" It's not yellow. It's got smoked glass doors. We go in and now the old man is an old woman and we look for the elevator. A small parade of disabled people with silly party/helmet hats on go by and we smile and sing the weird calliope music they are playing. I see an elevator and we get in and at first I only see two buttons and then the button 13. I push it, the woman says, \"No, bad luck.\" \"I don't believe that unlucky 13 business. That just happens to be the number of the floor we have to go to the Columbia Record Co., and book,\" I add, because we are now returning a book. As we get out of the elevator, we are at a bar. So we stop for a drink. The old man is now seated at a table behind the bar, watching us. He looks tired. I look for the bartender. A young woman pops up and asks what I want. I say, \"Do you have any sugared snacks? I am hungry for something sweet.\" The old woman is close to me and I realize she'd like to make love, and I think, \"But, she's a woman now, not a man, that would make this a lesbian thing. Besides, she doesn't have a penis now, so what's the point?\" I tell the bartender to look for sugar-free ice cream. She doesn't have any. The only thing she has is teas and soda water that is sugar free. I decide on the teas because they have interesting flavors. Meanwhile people come crowding down the hall and I'm pressed up against the bar. Then several zoo animals are walked by. I see a rhino come around the corner and realize he could poke me in the butt with his horn, so I try to scrunch up to the bar as far as I can. I see the rhino turn his head so that the horn is pressing nearer and I say to heck with this and hop up to sit on the bar. Two good-looking young men who look alike are other bartenders and they laugh and say, \"You could have got it in the butt.\" \"No thanks!\" I say, realizing they are probably gay and like it up their butt. Then around the corner comes more animals and I am relieved it's no more rhinos, but a herd of dogs, each on a leash being walked by this guy. Even the tails had a leash on them with bells. He walks them, or rather they drag him down the other hall."

Suddenly she turns into a crazed creature that kills and maims. She must touch your hands and then rips you up, your blood rushing out all over. The man sees her do that to some research animals and runs to tell the others. All the blue uniformed (overalls like mechanics) gather together and she comes in, sweet and interesting, a siren hard to resist. He almost lets her touch him, but the others rush around him and they all hold hands. She blacks out and comes to seeming normal. She asks, \"Did I black out?\" They all nervously watch her and try to appear nonchalant. She says, \"I need to do the weight drop.\" They all go with her. It is a machine that runs straight up 200 ft. and then smashes toward the ground very fast. She is very adventurous and loves it as fast as it will go. The men love it too and are nearly swooning. One man says, \"Wow! That's even better than sex.\" They admire her. Then they run to another room and hold hands. She comes in, cajoling, needing to connect and hold hands. A woman runs in screaming, \"She got to all the animals. You should see them. It's horrible.\" I see and hear blood spurting out of their bodies. It's sickening. She grabs the last hand of the serpentine and one of her hands is free. The crazy woman comes toward her. The woman at the end of the line wants to give in to her. I (now a woman) scream, \"No, NO! Don't let her touch you.\" I manage to penetrate the spell the monster woman has created, so she goes up to a woman named Doris, in the middle of the serpentine. She nearly lures Doris into letting her join the line. I scream over and over, \"Doris, Doris, don't let her. Concentrate.\" I break the spell again. The monster woman goes from the end woman to Doris over and over again, almost making it each time. I am exhausted, but must fight on."

I find a bathroom with a tiny, broken toilet. I go in and remind myself not to really pee. I think I should just get up and do it right. A woman with her 4-year-old daughter opens the door and then apologizes. I then get up to walk home (like toward the M City house). I see my father in a car a block away, he's worried about me and is looking for me. He waves a black and white poster at me. I wave back, embarrassed to be late and relieved he's here to help me.

He catches me firmly and hugs me. I look back and see a wall of rock and say, \"It's a good thing we went on the bridge after all!\" We now get to the door of the house (it's like we're in a tunnel).

We only want to spend intensive time together, obsessing on each other. There isn't room for anything or anyone else. We kiss, we speak poetry of love to each other. We make love, hug, fondle and caress. There is no world beyond our world of intense love of each other. It feels wonderful. We do our trapeze act together, flying around and doing flips and turns in perfect synchronicity. The act is beauty in motion. When the act is over, we simply are together, loving, 24 hours a day. There is something about him having an affair with a woman and that hurt, but I just intensified my loving to such a degree, there was no time, thought or need for another, only me. Now we are getting married. I am in a beautiful white dress and as we are walking up the aisle. I whisper to him, \"I'm pregnant.\" He is thrilled and I am too, at peace. Now all is complete. I'm also a little amazed at the fact that I can get pregnant, because we're both so old. We spend months, maybe years together, and then he builds a bicycle, a special one that is fast and efficient. I set out on a bike trek, alone. It is for some reason important that I separate from Burt for a period of time, maybe to prepare for when he dies and I am left alone. So I pedal on down the highway. I stop at a gas station and while there, a man in a souped up flashy car with a yellow fringe top that has a smart mouth roars in, fills up and roars out. At first, I'm annoyed at his seeming insensitivity, his maleness and immaturity. Then I find it amusing and decide to try and catch up with him on my bike to observe him more. I pedal quickly and see a crowd stopped on a bridge observing something in the sky. I stop, because I have to, they block the road. I look up and see two rockets taking off, one chasing the other through the sky. It's a NASA launch and has something to do with relationships. I watch and then speed on my way, through the crowd to catch this man in the car. Next I'm on a freeway with cars and other bikers. I pass them all, feeling strong and fast. Now I've come to the river and see the other side. That's home, where Burt is and I miss him. I see I'll have to backtrack to get on the bridge and that will make me lose time finding that car. I then see an entrance ramp close by and pedal up it gathering speed to merge with car traffic. I speed across the bridge very confident and fast. I don't really care about the car anymore. I miss Burt. I stop at the other side at a book stall on the side of the road. I see a book that was given to me by Burt and I fall on the books, happy, rolling around in them like they were water. I want to buy them all and my daughter sees another book, only purchased here, that I'll want and she tries to buy them for me. I want to hurry back to my beloved Burt and happiness."

I get the right one on the third time. My kiddie car locks onto the track, but the others don't. I wait while they go back to get them locked on. Then my car lurches forward like on a roller coaster ride, alone. I look back, worried. He waves and says, \"Oh, well, you'll be all right.\" I'm not convinced. I go down this steep incline in a tunnel fast. I am stopped by a stack of breakfast cereal boxes. He peeks down and says that will hold you. He leaves and of course they start to give and I go down and down and around and out. He's there. Each child is given a disability to emulate and experience on the next ride or challenge.

She starts to pick one in front of me and I point out to her I'm the dumb one. She takes me to a run that is in front of the train engine and crosses the tracks. I have to run as fast as I can. If I don't do it fast enough, I'll be squished to death. I stand there thinking, \"I can't run fast, I can barely move. What will I do?\" I think of tricking them by running out of bounds, but I am supposed to be dumb. As I'm thinking, other people do their runs. One tries the out-of-bounds trick. It doesn't work. One slows down deliberately and gets caught. Two metal gates close on her and pretend to squish her. I begin my run. I do the best I can, but I limp and am slow. I push hard and cross the line 1/2 second before time is up. I lay on the ground sobbing at my pain. The man runs from the train over to me, concerned, just like I wanted him to. He scoops me up in his arms, reassures himself I'm unhurt and cuddles me. I relax in his embrace. He loved me all along."

I also see two more sliding doors, and through a crack I see more beds, one with a plaid coverlet, and I see the movement of someone's knees and realize someone else has that room. I see a door that could lead to a bathroom. We are at a sort of retreat and we each have to take a turn at cleaning up after a meal. The food isn't very good and Aunt and I decide (her suggestion) we go to town to have dinner. I think about the added expense and the waste, but agree. I am now looking through a book. It has some pictures of young boys and men. The other woman likes one of the pictures and wonders who it is. I look through to see if I can find more information. I see the name Hans Solo. I chuckle because that's from \"Darth Vader\" movies and mention that my Aunt had a different memory connection to the name. The number 512 is mentioned and I can't remember why the number seems familiar."

We are setting up some display that is important. She has a great big female doll, sort of a floppy stuffed cloth doll. I have a male doll, a design in black rock on metal. It is much smaller than the female doll. We each go to place the dolls on this table, box, altar place. Her doll takes up most of the space and I disapprove. My doll is the King (Jesus?), after all, and more important. While I am adjusting them, this man comes up and talks about his disability and how hard it is. I am annoyed at him. He's obviously feeling sorry for himself. My disability is obviously much worse than his, but I try, somewhat absentmindedly, to talk with him sympathetically. I go back to my \"office\" area. It's nearly quitting time. The phone rings and this same man says, with admiration in his voice, \"I'm the one you helped, the one with the bunny leg in a cast,\" meaning his disability was so slight, if it existed at all, that he had a stuffed bunny's leg in his cast. He thinks I'm wonderful and helped him so much. I am embarrassed and thank him for the positive feedback. It's not often people take the time to tell me I did a good job. I look down at the bandage on my thumb (left one). It is now soaked in blood. I am concerned and end the phone conversation. I point it out to the woman next to me (the one new to the job), and she unwraps the gauze. The tip of my thumb has an oval shaped hole in it and is bleeding. I decide I need to go see the Doctor about this. I'm aware it's a minor cut but I'll feel better if a doctor looks at it and bandages it right. So I walk through halls, turning here and there. I come to a place where if I turn right, I go downstairs to the University Dr. (An.) and the plays. (Jock is there and for a moment I think he's Dr. An. Jock looks like a bearded wimpy counselor from OCA.) I choose to turn left, upstairs, to the community college doctor's clinic. As I'm walking upstairs, I pass rooms where operatic concerts are being performed. I see two people standing on the steps listening. I see a cat curled up on a carpeted stair sleeping. I think it's nice, I can hear the concert as I pass by. I then get to the top and have to step over a low counter to get to the right corridor. I realize the blood has stopped by now and it seems silly to go on and see the doctor, but I decide to anyway. They can wrap it better than me."

I feel something wet on my nightgown and realize it is semen emission, either leakage or he had an orgasm. We both start giggling uncontrollably like teens in a library. It's so ironic that we've agreed to be friends, and sleep together and then he has an emission. Now the cook/old boyfriend is mean. He searches through my drawers of clothes to read my diary and then holds the material over me to keep me in line. John Candy is watching him from the hall.

I see water waves spraying up among the rocky shapes off in the distance. There are people on the beach and it's somewhat crowded. It's also kind of muddy. I need to leave there, perhaps some eruption or danger is possible. A man and myself (who is sort of Justin and Lucy) needs to get away and are being held back somehow (a bad guy). They are finally permitted logs (sawed off segments, maybe four or five of them stacked). They go to the river and throw them in and ride them like a horse, their feet, with shoes on, underwater (dragging their feet). They float down this huge, wide green river, feeling pretty clever at their use of the logs, rather than being burdened by carrying them. The woman also decides to keep near the shoreline. In case she falls off, she'll be able to swim in. But there are rocks and shallows, so they have to go out some distance to get around that. This is all working out fairly well, until the river changes. There are level changes (like giant steps or locks) (like in Panama Canal). They will have to get out of the river and carry their logs until they get past this part. There's something about a bus ride either taken or missed. Then she sees the river up ahead. It is rushing white water and big falls and rapids! They both agree it will no longer be OK to go down the river. So they walk. Now there is some bad guy. I think he is the owner of a shyster carnival set up. He says we have to shoot at a target to see our sharpshooting skills. Maybe we'll win (our freedom?). He points to a (see drawing) circle with a hole in it of green stone that is on a wall and moving in the breeze. He grins. I look again and see it's a (see drawing) pyramid-shaped stone and therefore hasn't a hole in it for the arrow to hit. I say, \"No thanks. That's too hard. Not fair. I'll shoot at the dolly in the water-filled case.\" I see a case like a china cabinet of Grandma Agnes'. It is filled with water and in it is a fat dolly. The guy agrees/laughing. He tells the dolly to get out. She goes out the back door and as she's shutting the door, her \"fat suit\" padding gets caught in the door. At the breasts, three or four breasts of the padding is all caught in the door. Now the pad floats off the dolly and floats in the water. The real dolly comes in, her porcelain face old-fashioned and sweet. She has ringlets. She stands at the back of the case waiting for me to attempt to shoot her. Now a padded sheet (like over a piano) is all over the case so I can't see where the dolly is. The guy asks, \"Want to get up closer?\" It's like he's being generous, but he's really not. I smile with confidence and say, \"No thanks.\" I aim my bow and arrow sort of at a cloth toy mouse and shoot. My tiny arrow looks like it's missed because it hit at the front of the case. When the padding is opened, it is revealed that this tricky guy had the dolly move to the front, so my arrow had pierced her ear. I had won, just barely. But I had won. We were free to go."

I see the outdoors and kids playing off to the left. I feel embarrassed and see a shower curtain. I reach over and pull it to me, closing it. One slit is left open at my left.

I see poorly made miniature pieces with huge screws in them instead of tiny little nails. I see a house (see drawing). We laugh at this house. We're then in another open kind of house and an older man (maybe two) and a 13(?)-year-old girl are talking. The man sees us and waves goodbye to the girl saying, \"I was just kidding about 'Doing It.'\" The girl comes into the house and I say, \"You'd better not 'do it' with him!\" She says, \"Don't worry, I won't.\" She's annoyed with me for even thinking she'd get snookered by this guy.

He's holding the rock up to a picture and they are identical. He calls it a long Latin-like name. I am surprised he could find it. He then takes off his shirt, maybe to get down to work. I notice he's gained some weight and it looks good on him. I want to go hug him and cuddle, but he moves on. He's now straightening up the magazines on the coffee table.

One man says to us, \"Careful.\" My father says, \"Let's go look.\" He jumps down on the stairs. I lean over and he holds his arms up for me to jump. \"Are you sure?,\" I ask.

He asks me to step through a golden, wired design I could walk through to sit on a chair and listen as he plays his piano. He goes up a few stairs to play the piano. I try to bend down and walk through the wire devices. It keeps bumping my head until I am finally on my hands and knees and still won't fit.

The first try doesn't work and I do it again, only slower, and it locks. Then I return to the living room, and Dora and Duane are seated there. I then go to the kitchen and find the two women. They put on bridesmaid dresses and I am putting on the bride's dress. We will each take turns wearing it before we take it in to Dora who will be the bride at 8.00 p.m. I see my white satin top and the net petticoats and feel that the dress should be prettier than that and decide it will have a long satin skirt over the net. The two women, one dark-haired, bring the bouquets they had made - satin with a white gardenia. I am very impressed at their kindness in making these. The rest of the bride's bouquet is in the other room; I go to get it. I then see another room I didn't know was in the house, a bedroom where the dark-haired woman lives. I feel she's a CIA spy. It has no walls. I wonder if it gets too cold and rainy for her. I come out, headed for the living room, when Katrina comes and says we need to go get gas for the car. I agree because it would be nice to have all these details worked out so Dora's wedding goes smoothly. I am in the back seat; Katrina is driving.

I want him to quit fooling around and come in and have an orgasm. A small, red, furred kitty is outside the front door in the foyer and it belongs to my roommate.

I want Pat to make love to me and I start kissing him, and then I realize he's done. He had orgasm and I am left sexually awake and frustrated. He sits up and gets up as my roommate is returning.

We go out of the room, talking, chatting and duck into the bathroom. I put the diaphragm on the shelf. It turns into or is next to a small black object, cylindrical in shape (see picture)."

A good-looking man sits next to me and smiles. We are attracted to each other. He is now a member of the C department. I talk with Mabel and Juliet who are at the other end of the couch. They are distant and busy. I lay down, curled up, watching. He lays down beside me. I say, \"This used to be my corner.\" He smiles and says it's his now, but he'd like to share it. We talk, our interest in each other growing. He asks me out, says he'll give me a ride home. Great, we get in his car. He sees a restaurant and pulls up. We will go have dinner. It's a ritzy place. The maitre d' comes over and looks me up and down and coughs meaningfully. I say, \"I suppose I don't meet your standards.\" He points to my shoes: plain, black and dusty flats. Well, what can I do? These are my shoes. He suggests I go into this other room where their staff will spruce me up. Jim isn't around and I go, hesitantly. The maitre d' disappears through the door and I say, \"Yoo hoo\" from off a balcony upstairs. Relieved, I \"Yoo hoo\" back. He comes downstairs and we are glad to be together. The maitre d' comes back to find me. Jim points to the pants cloth on his (Jim's) behind and says, \"I'm an executive of the editors and journalists and I need these pants cleaned. The maitre de is very impressed. I'm a little surprised Jim would lie and put on this act. Now it's after dinner and we are going to get back in the car (a sports coup 1930's -'40s convertible). I put a lot of things in the back seat (including a protractor). I say, \"I'd best remember I put that there in case anyone sits there. It's sharp and hidden. It could hurt someone.\" Then my Aunt Naomi shows up and wants to be introduced to Jim. She's looking him over and approves. He is OK. Jim says, \"Hop in, we'll give you a ride.\" I then realize it would be best if I get in the back and think of the irony that I must be careful of the protractor. We all get in and drive. They are chattering and getting along very well and teasing me in a loving way. It feels good. He stops the car and gets out and goes into a huge office area that has rows and rows of file cabinets. It's a film processing company. I ask, \"What are you doing?\" as he opens drawers. He says he's getting me some film for my camera. I had wanted some. I say, \"You can't do that. This is the company, you can't steal the film. No, I will not let you.\" I walk out and get in the car. He hands me a 8-10 frame sheet of already developed negative. I have three feelings: (1) that's not very much film; (2) I can't use it, its got picture on it already; (3) I can't accept it anyway, its not mine and not right. I sort of think I see an image of Howard on the negative and think it will be an image of high school and Howard. I look closer and it is not. He says it's OK, the film will erase those images and put the new ones on, like a tape cassette you record over. I don't approve, but my resolve is wearing down. I really do like him, so I take it and we go on. Now I'm in his apartment and we are going to be married. We are very much in love and happy. I'm getting my kind of clothes ready. He shows me a door that goes downstairs to a secret room. (There's a slight feeling there are women down there, maybe a brothel.) Then he says he has to leave for awhile and will be back. I am alone and three friends come over. One says, \"Let's go down to that room and see what's there.\" I say, \"No, we can't.\" He said I wasn't to do that. They cajole and I finally agree one can go and we go down the stairs, but others I don't know follow, and it's a party I can't control. And then Jim appears at the top of the stairs, absolutely furious with me for breaking my word. We all go back up. Everyone else leaves and he is yelling at me, \"How could you?\" I then get furious at him. \"How dare you have a secret place I cannot go to?\" I hold a stick/cane and sweep whisky glasses off the bar and they smash all around Jim. He is amazed at my anger. \"You are really angry, \" he says impressed. I continued, \"How dare you not trust me? If we were honest with each other, we would have no secret places. I will not permit it. I will not accept it.\" He then leaves, angry. I am miserable. I wait for his return, crying and weeping, because I'm hurt and upset and still love him. Days pass. I toss and turn on the huge bed, the covers wrinkling and rippling as I toss and turn. I wake up and finish out the dream awake! I hear an insistent bell ringing from the secret room. Finally I must go see -- maybe it's him or about him. I go down the stairs. A man near death from gun shot wounds comes past way up and says, \"Tell Jim the key is 2908.\" He dies and then Jim returns. He is exhausted and glad and amazed. I am still there. I tell him the code, which saves his life. He is a spy for CIA or something. We embrace, still loving each other."

This seems to intimidate the two trucks and they carefully back up the way they came and are gone. I now see Howard/my father. I feel strange because of the combination. Is he a peer or of the previous generation. How do I communicate and respond - with open ease or with respectful diffidence? Howard/my father says he is sad. Pete got a divorce and comes to live with him and he hasn't even talked about it with Pete. He should be better able to be emotional and open.

One notices me and I explain what's going on. He's an officer and he orders me to stay put until he tells me to move. Time passes, days, and I stay. I somehow manage to adapt and survive. I even figure out how to get food. A soldier comes by and brings me a piece of K-meat. I don't accept contaminated meat; however, I have standards, you know. So I see him take it to another soldier, a \"cooks,\" and he tests it. First, it's old and then it's contaminated. He throws it out and gets me a good one, dropping it in my sand pile, pretending it as an accident. I sort of realize that if he can move around out there, I could too, but I wait. I have my orders. Weeks pass. I shift my position and re-dig a better hole.

We chat and I explain why I'm there, buried in the sand. She is very sympathetic. Now I'm in a blue sleeping bag. I ask her not to be so conspicuous when she is talking to me, because it makes it obvious I'm there. She apologizes and she asks how long I have to stay there. I say, \"Until they give me my orders.\" She says, \"Shall I tell you a story?\" I say, \"Sure. Which one?\" She says, \"How about the one, \"Scary to touch\"? It's children's campfire spook story.

I see ornate refurbished old-fashioned stoves (like I saw on TV) that cost 4 to 6 thousand dollars, lovely and well made (maybe 1920's style or earlier and some 1950's). There is lots of stuff. He looks at me, waiting and watching my reactions. I say, \"May I look around?\" He says, \"Yes.\" This is all so serious. I look around and see a huge cupboard. I open it and see many loaves of bread, maybe 20 or more lined up on a bread board. I pull it out and look at the bread. I'm amazed there is so much. I make no comment. He is somewhat anxious, wondering how I'm feeling about all this. Do I feel accepting? Do I understand? I know now that he's the one and we will get married. I'm walking toward him to tell him so when a younger brother of his rushes in with the disturbing news that his mother is having an affair with Ethan. How inopportune. I must deal with this before I can marry this man. It is my duty to take the mother and Ethan aside and straighten them out (like a parent with teens). The man starts to go to the other room to wait this out, but I call him over and kiss him long and lovingly to let him know I've accepted him and everything is all right between us. He and I keep kissing because it's a wondrous feeling of connectedness, but we must part temporarily so I can take care of this interruption. He goes into another room. I follow the mother and Ethan into their living room. It is also huge and full of furniture, ritzy, very expensive stuff. I see Ethan seated, waiting to be chastised. The mother reminds me a bit of Thea. As I'm about to get the information, Ethan says, \"I hope there won't be racial implications here.\" \"What racial?\" I ask, thinking he's stalling. I then remember he's Italian. \"The Italian Stud\" stereotype is what he's referring to. I hear a loud and annoying buzzing and realize it's my wheelchair battery recharger. I must plug it in. I say, \"Wait a minute,\" and walk around with this long extension cord looking for a plug in. I finally find one tiny one on a wall and plug it in. The noise is so loud we have to shout. It's hard to hear. Ethan suggests we go to the other end of this huge room. I agree. As we are walking through the rich furnishings, I tell \"Terence,\" a cousin or younger brother, to take the recharger out of the room and shut the double doors; maybe it will be quieter that way. He does. Ethan says something about Dwight. I say, \"Who is Dwight?\" He had meant his son and at first I thought he had meant my man. I now realize Ethan has had at least three wives. I find it amusing. I'll be related by marriage to Ethan. He'll be like a father-in-law. As we walk, the mother points out a coffee table made of giant clocks and says, \"My watches, they are my watches.\" Ethan walks beside me, showing me snapshots that are very long for panoramic shots. He's showing me scenes from a production of his. I see a Venus de Milo type laying in an ocean. As he shows the snaps, a sort of story unfolds. A half human, half creature (sort of mermaid) is in the waters and comes near the shore to be able to kiss a pony who is on land. Meanwhile I see a naked Ethan with a hairy chest and back (like my father) in a huge vase/pot so he looks like a centaur. Now the snaps are of the pony lying on land at the water's edge and his inching along on his side trying to get into the water so they can kiss."

He pulls out a knife and shows me the blade. He doesn't threaten me, just implies I'll get cut if I don't cooperate. I drive on. Now my car swerves. \"Oh, no,\" I say, He asks what's wrong. \"The tires are going bad\" I say. \"Slow down,\" he says. I pull over to the side of the road. He gets out. There's a man and a woman in the front seat with us now. The woman goes with the knife guy. He tells me to stay in the car and get some rest. I lay down in the back seat. Apparently I'd been up driving for hours and he needs me to be alert to drive. So I lay down, aware of this other blonde, crew-cut man still in front seat. He gets out and walks around the car to the open back seat at my feet. I'm in trouble and I know it. He crawls in and on top of me. Rape. I started yelling, \"Help me. help me.\" He's trying to put his hand over my mouth. I struggle and bite. Two people who are sitting ahead of the car on the side of the road come towards us to help. The man gets off me and goes out into a cow field and starts shooting people at random. First he has a pistol and then a double-barreled 12 gauge shotgun. I am appalled. He's coming back to me to kill me. He shoots a woman in the belly. He aims the gun for me. People mill around. A man is seated in the back seat where I am. The killer comes to the back window and looks in. He has a flame thrower and is trying to light it. The man in the seat with me picks up a huge lighter and flames it and points it back at the killer's mouth. Somehow the killer swallowed a grenade or bullet in his attempt to load the flame thrower and so this flame, on the inside of the window glass, is supposed to heat him up so he'll explode. The flame catches around his mouth. A Native American woman like Theresa stands next to him and I violently motion to her to get away. I didn't want her killed in the explosion and I hoped the killer doesn't understand my gestures. He's taking a long time to explode and he gets his flame thrower pointed at me. Once I got out of car, but he came around and I got back in. The flames hit the inside of the elbow (crook of arm) and I feel burning pain. We are waiting and hoping he'll explode."

The father is arrogant and emotionally flippant. I tell him I want to investigate the man/boy's past. He agrees and seems quite willing in a negligent way to supply all the stored things remaining of the past. He brings me, one box at a time, three boxes, big flat ones. I open them and find a leather cowboy chaps/pants the boy wore. I find a yellow heavy plastic playsuit. It's cute and in excellent condition. I find some grade reports, a teacher's note in the 1st grade music book. I can pinpoint the problem to the 1st or 2nd grade, but nothing conclusive.

Then the two male puppets are moving and talking. One turns to the other and wants to make love, so the other one becomes a \"female\" and they have sex. I feel orgasm. A voice says, \"That's OK, they are doing this because they are not really homosexual, they are both\" (meaning bi-sexual). [BL]"

I pull up next to him and it's a tight fit because a third car is to my right. I tell him not to worry, I'll be careful, and that I have a right to park here. I get out and walk across the parking lot to my apartment. It's in a \"hall\" or row of apartments. The first and second one looks nice, and each one after that looks progressively more old and broken down. I live in the first one. I have to walk up four or five steps and it's hard to do. I wonder why it's not accessible. I go in and drop a tape cassette on the floor and then need to find it. I search and search and find lots of other junk. It's a big mess and it's all my roommates stuff. She's very sloppy. I then walk through the rooms - the kids' bedroom and the kitchen. The kitchen is huge and there are four tables (two are hers) and covered with leftover breakfast stuff. I think, \"Why am I putting up with this?\" and then wonder how I'd manage with her gone - all that room in the kitchen. But I do decide to ask her to move. She and her boyfriend are angry and come after me. I run outside and see the nice man I parked next to. I go behind him and he readily jumps into the fray and runs the two meanies away. I thank him and apologize for using him as a shield. It was MY fight, after all. He is fine about it and was happy to help. I then go visit Ginny and Ernie who are busy. They'd been selling their things at a very cheap price. They are telling me how awful it feels to sell nice things they paid good money for, for just a few dollars. I ask Ginny why they're doing that. It doesn't make much sense. Are they in financial difficulties? I look at Ginny and see Ernie seated in a high chair (baby's) and am surprised. I didn't see them switch sides and am not used to Ernie in that position! I want them to meet my new roommate. We walk across the street to my place. Again, I am aware of having a hard time walking up the stairs. I open the door and the living room is well picked up and very neat. The nice man and lots of his children are there. It's like a pre-school room - some watching TV, some napping on the couch. He points to a box and I ask, \"What's it's name?\" ( a baby that on closer inspection is a stuffed animal that's alive). He's green and cuddly and his name is Elmer. I pet him and exclaim, \"He's purring.\" I think he's cute. There's a sense of comfort with my new roommate situation."

I am eloquent and empathetic (I think) and she hates hearing it, but bears up well, not yelling or interrupting, but shuddering and bowing her head sometimes. I tell her she is presenting a role model for Charla that teaches her all the wrong things. I point to the mess in Charla's room where she's shredded paper and torn up her toys and I say, \"I know you think she's destructive, but look what's she's learned from.\" We walk through the rooms and I point out mess after mess. \"And here, I know, is my mess. But, be honest, if it weren't there, yours would be.\" Then I'm in bed. Someone comes into the room and I struggle to open my eyes.

He's seated on a large thing and he would pick up her hand and place it on his head so she could caress her hair and she would remove it and he would put it back and so on. It is annoying and intense. I decide to help her and I sign up to her to turn and go down the stairs. She runs fast and I watch as the man, angry, runs after her. She turns suddenly and runs up another set of stairs. He comes up where I'm still standing. I signal her to go down the hall and get into a room quick. The man, at first fooled, comes up the stairs and I watch him and point in another direction. I hear a woman's voice down the hall and think it is Ginny and am concerned he will hear, but I look and it's some other woman talking on the show. He is fooled and goes the other way."

Now it's time to play a softball game and I'm telling who is on what bases, and all the players are ready except for first base (who is on first). It is supposed to be Riker and I look up at the second story windows and yell \"Riker! you are on.\" He comes sleepily to the window; he'd been napping. He comes down. Now Troi and I are in bed together cuddling. I am aware of her lovely naked body and as we adjust or position, my hand accidentally brushes past the nipple of one breast. I feel a little tense but assure myself this is not sexual, merely sensual and, in fact, that is so. We are talking about it being time for me to change, because if I don't, it won't be possible to leave the planet and go with Riker. In order to help me, Troi calls in Ellie who had prepared a series of rocks (a gate, etc.) tied up by a string. I say, \"You really want to get it of me, don't you?\" semi-teasing. She says seriously, \"No, but l want... (something like you to be happy).\" Troi and I then exchange bodies so I can experience what it is like to be free of my own patterns of thought and feeling I've built up since birth, and to experience her way of feeling her own feelings. It's a delightful experience. Then I see her push a table over and hit her ankle and limp with pain. I go and kneel in front of her and try to be sympathetic. \"Does it hurt?\" I ask. She grimaces and says, \"I'm fine.\""

It's a \"hospital,\" but it sure doesn't look like it. A woman nurse comes up, only dressed in regular clothes. I explain. She and several other nurses go to Ginny to \"touch the lover,\" to feel the extended belly of the pregnant woman, but all they see is a concave, empty, flat belly since the fetus is only a small little bump.

I am frustrated, especially with the two boys. I keep trying, but they are stubborn and angry.

I feel tired and unable to give it the quantities it needs. I feel more and more tired myself till I am nearly comatose. A small baby girl (1 year) comes to me.

The dark man is going to set up an accident for Burt Lancaster so he'll be killed. I could be hurt too. Two older police detectives are up there on the trapezes to fight out what's going to happen and save us. They are overweight, pot-bellied, and fumble. One man nearly falls because he couldn't grasp the trapeze. His timing was off, but somehow he manages. They figure out that the dark man has cut the circular ring holding the rigging. They pull it down before Burt gets up there and say, \"You are under arrest,\" to the dark man, who escapes and grabs a mentally retarded girl as his cover. The crowd gasps in horror. I realize I must save her by going in her place. I don't want to, but must and then somehow that bit of the dream is replayed and he is arrested before he can take the girl hostage and he is taken off. Now I hug Burt and it feels so warm and safe. I realize he can't say, \"I love you\" back, but it's OK. He now is teaching me an act that doesn't involve high flying. He has some little figures on a table and he calls out which one I pick up in my left hand. I pick it up, a figure of an older woman, and its jelly like outer cover comes off in my hand. I try to put it back on because that spoils the trick, but I've messed it up and it's not quite the same. I feel loved. This new act is so safe and pedestrian, but I am glad I don't have to be up there any more. Now Burt is going to fly again and I see him. The dark man had tricked him. Burt was walking into the arena and a group of people seated at a ringside table had their feet way. So he chose to go up a different pole than he usually does. (This was set up by the dark man.) Burt and I are seated ringside watching this as though I am reading an article in a film magazine about it and the pictures are like a movie we're watching Burt in a sexual turn-on to me. I feel alive with sexual desire and he turns and smiles and says, \"Being in tights is not a good time to get an erection. We laugh and sit there together knowing that later we will make love. Meanwhile, we see \"Burt\" go up the wrong or tampered-with pole. It snaps in half and he is smashed as he flies into the broken bottom half, which looks like a huge penis. He is crucified on it and his pain and humiliation is strong. I feel sad for him. Now his friend, another male flyer with a deformed small left arm (like Merle), is going up. I am amazed at how he can do that easily, one-armed. I look for the \"continued story\" on another page and after leafing through the magazine, I realize the story will be continued in the next monthly issue, April/May, 1991. The words \"Break\" in white letters on black background indicates the end of this first installment. So I put down the magazine and hug Burt and he suggests I wait until my twin sister is in bed asleep and then come upstairs and we'll make love. I sneak to our bedroom (sister's and mine) and put on a salve that will protect me from sexually transmitted diseases, I wipe off some white residue off the chin just below my lips (like Alka Seltzer foam). I think, \"Too bad, one has to be concerned about such things, but I want to be safe and careful.\" I think Lydia is in bed asleep, but some part of me realizes she is right now upstairs with Burt. I find that amazing that we are sharing him and pretending we aren't. I go upstairs in eager sexual tension and Burt is there, smiling and loving. He's not mine for always, but mine for now."

It is hard at first, but then I get better. Fluffy is with me. Now I'm returning, running easily in the rain. I feel good. I have camaraderie with my cat who lays down every once in a while to get her tummy rubbed. I call to her often to keep up with me and pet her tummy. Then Fluffy wanders a bit toward the road and I see a vehicle coming and I am concerned she might get run over. It's almost like the fact that the vehicle is there that attracts her like hypnotism. I call to her. The vehicle is a house trailer with segments like washing machines and dryers. She gets caught by the skin of her side/belly. The vehicle is nearly stopped in its concern not to harm her. I get her uncaught and we then go to the house, open the front door and enter, passing Howard and another man who are on their way out. They come back in. I try to ignore them, but know they are attracted to me and I feel sad about Howard. We've lived together all this time, but not in relationship. I rub Fluffy's tummy and see the wedding band on my finger and feel sad that I give more love and attention to the cat than I do Howard. I go into his bedroom to take off my wet layers of jogging jackets. I lay them out to dry on the floor. Then I put on my old jeans and mauve tee-shirt with laces and admire how good it feels to be slim and trim and in good physical condition again."

I go out to dance with them, but stay on the outskirts of the huge circle of dancers, being careful not to be disrespectful and intrusive, but wanting to be a part of it all. I dance South American calypso kinds of steps. After that, I decide to go see how the man I've hired to clean up and weed the garden area is doing. He's been there two days now and I think I owe him $75.00 by now. I go to the garden and he's got lots of area cleaned out. The plants look like large lettuce leaves all closely grown together. Then a woman asks where the door is, and I turn and look at the house. I see where the door was and go around the house to the left and find a door. I go in to see what's inside this new shop; nothing much. I figured out it's a lunch counter, but so new the menu isn't up yet. I see Ellie eating a sort of thing like a taco/hotdog. I ask her to come over and help me retie my left strap on my halter. It's two straps that had been tied together but she chooses to tie each one separately. It seems to work. I go outside to find the gardener man to pay up my $75.00. He wants a written receipt and I say, \"I have lots of paper, no problem.\" Only as I pick them up, each sheet has some scribbles or notes or lists on them. I can't find a fully blank sheet. I offer one with only a few scribbles on it (like Charla's drawings), but he refuses; it must be blank. Then I realize if I'm going to keep this vast lawn area kept up, I will have to hire a gardener full time or it will all become overgrown and wild. I look up to the windows in my mansion. I think, \"It's too bad don't have very much money or furniture, but if I carefully place things at the window, I can still manage to enjoy the view of my huge lawn and garden.\""

Feeling frustrated that I went to extra work for nothing, I agree to cut out the new addition. I ask the director how we are to hang up the pictures on stage.

His sister, \"Peggy Sue\" (really Sonja), comes by and tiredly takes my coat off my back and puts it over his head like a tent.

He is pleased I have such interest in him and his stuff. We walk now toward the house and we enter a room. He says it's the goose house where he'd sneak into the palace through it as a child. In a side room I see a big Mother Goose peering at me suspiciously. I see feathers (white) on the floor where I'm standing. The King says, \"When I was a boy, sometimes she'd let me pet her babies.\" I walk into her room, holding a pink stuffed baby doll.

I see Ellie's hair is cut very short (like a dyke lesbian's hair cut). Charla's is also cut short, like a pageboy cut. I see red sores on her head. Her hair is thin. I don't want to touch her. I give away a big box on my table stand next to my bed to Ellie's friend. I take three or four empty tape cassette boxes out of it first. There is dust on everything. I go into another room and feel something in my right ear. I pull on it. It's a dental floss string. I pull and pull. I can feel it inside my head. There is lots of ear wax on the string. I wonder how I managed to have left dental floss in my ear, but at last I'm getting my ear cleaned! The floss sticks to the wall and bits of dead leaves stick to it. I'm back in the bedroom and I look out the window and say to Ellie, \"Look, here's lots of wood bits I can use.\" I see shingles and pallets, etc. stacked up outside. I start to leave the room and Ellie says, \"But then we won't be together\" (or won't be able to talk), and I say, \"Well, then, you can come with me.\" She follows me as I go from room to room. I had remembered I had more rooms and was surprised now to see I really did have more. This is good news. I can get three or more roommates and make lots of money and get lots of help. Then I wonder whose rooms these used to be and if I could rent them out. Some of them had their things still in them. These rooms are spacious, nice and clean. My old bedroom is ugly, cluttered and old (see drawing in dream book). I see a fat woman and her kids cleaning one bedroom. I see lots of makeup jars and things on a dresser all dusted and tidy. I wonder out loud who cleaned this and how she's going to get paid. This concerns the woman who did it and thinks I'm to pay for it. In the next room I exclaim, \"Oh, look! A washer.\" I won't have to use the old one outside and wonder if I should use this one. It really isn't mine. In the next room I see a closet filled with pretty little dresses, shiny satin material, shades of blue, sequined halter tops and I really like these dresses and wish I could wear them, but they would not fit. They are for a small, petite, slim person. I see a door and open it, and see the dining room table all laid out. I shut the door and see a small card on the wall. It's printed and says \"Compliments should (or) sound Dwight.\" He's the one that owns the dresses and stuff. I think, \"There should be a comma between sound and Dwight.\" I assumed Dwight is his first name. The next room has a refrigerator. I open it and smell the odor of a fridge left too long and see a few food items like butter. Each room had a made bed in it. Blue bedspreads (blue and white like the one Bonnie gave me)."

Can't they see there's a war going on? Then I look around and notice the war is over. I get up out of my foxhole and follow the girls into a store. I look at the candy display. They are all out of the kind I like. A sweet little girl ( 8 or 10 years old) is there. Now I'm the girl. She and this little boy are Jack and Jill. They will be lovers when they grow up, but for now it is all innocent and sweet. They kiss and talk and share adventures. The general is now a grandfather and he lusts after the little girl. He sort of watches her, and follows her. She and Jack leave. She's glad to get rid of the sinister grandfather. Now Jack and Jill sit in a small boat, on the bare rock bed of a dry river bed. The water is being released upstream. It's like a carnival ride. I look upstream and see the surging force of the water and feel afraid. We'll be bowled over and drowned, so I say, \"Let's wait until the big wave is past us.\" But we stay and the water picks up our boat and we swirl and sway down the river bed. It's fun.

Then I decide to get up and go to the next room where there's a bed and covers where I can be comfortable. As I prepare to get in bed, Lydia's littlest girls all come running in wanting permission and money to go to the store and buy soda pop. I say, \"No!\" Then I notice they are all eating candy. One girl has a baby and holds her roughly by her hair. I rescue it and hold her in my arms. She's like a dolly, only alive. I realize it's 8 o'clock am and they haven't had breakfast yet. I'm tired because I haven't slept much. The radio had been playing loud and I'd tried to turn down the volume with no luck and so I'm tired, but the girls need a nutritious breakfast so I get up to fix it. Now I'm at Mary's house to visit. I hear her inside so I open the door and call to her. She's in the shower. I walk on in and see lots of women there. First I see Jennifer H. She's wearing a fake mustache like Groucho Marx or Charlie Chaplin. Then I see who all the women are. It's a dress-up party. They are all lesbians. Some women cut bits of their own hair and glued them to their mouths for their mustache. I look around, feeling out of place."

As Julie talks about some problem she has that makes her sad, I become aware that the heavy wooden mantle of the fireplace is shaking and slowly falling.

First, I see my parents' bedroom. It's very nice, with skylights and modern furniture. Right next to it is a recreation room, with games and refrigerators. I go upstairs and find Dwight's room. It's spacious. I think maybe I'd like this one rather than the one next to my parents'. I'd feel uncomfortable sleeping next to their room like I'd hear them making love or something. Dwight (who looks like Jack Lemmon) and I look out the window. \"Look, we even have a swimming pool.\" \"Yeah, but it's got dirty water in it.\" \"We could fill it up.\" It's long and narrow and only half filled with muddy water. \"So, if we're so rich, where are the tennis courts?\" I joke. I see a huge cement slab. \"That's our neighbor's land,\" I say, \"but look at his car.\" \"What kind is it?\" asks Dwight. \"It has no nose,\" I say. Dwight laughs at my clue. \"Then it must be a Volkswagen bus,\" he says. I say, \"Look over there. It's got wings.\" We see a yellow VW bug with fenders converted to look like those 1950's fins on cars. I see lots of books on shelves in another room. Maybe I'd like that room. My mother (young, maybe in her 30's) thinks I should stay with my original bedroom because it's on the ground floor and I wouldn't have to struggle with stairs and get tired. Then she reconsiders. After all, if we are rich enough to get this house and all the nice things in it, then we can afford a stair lift so I could get to any place I wanted. We then go to an \"outside\" room (like over a garage with an outdoor entrance). It's my bedroom, she says. I look around and see tables and chairs set up for a party with streamers and so on. I look at a man smiling at me and realize he's the professional party giver and he's giving me the party meant for Linda W. I point out it's the wrong party. He apologizes and goes away. I look around the \"suite,\" (see drawing in dream book). I see a small sitting room in Victorian dark woods and red velvet wall paper. I like that. I see an accessible bathroom. I look back in my bedroom and see a slim, narrow single bed (blue colors). I think, \"I want more than that.\" I see a double bed. I then decide I want a room to have fun in and a small separate room just for comfortable sleeping with a small toilet room very close to the bed so I won't have to walk far when it's painful. I see it there and I'm pleased. Now, a man comes up the stairs toward my room and wants to talk to my mother. He is suggesting we expand the garage to accommodate more cars in the future. I say to my mother, \"Don't let him nickel and dime us to death,\" (or my mother says, \"I knew they would try to nickel and dime us...\"). I walk with him to the garage and he says, \"See, you may get more cars,\" and I say, \"If we do, we can crowd them in or park them differently or build a carport roof to extend.\" He goes away. Now I'm going down the driveway and a car passes us and I see Sherry Lady in the passenger side and I say, \"Oh, it's the ____ family coming to visit.\" My mother tries to turn the car so we can go back and greet them. Now I'm in the back seat of Sherry's car as her husband turns the car and Sherry is very upset at him coming so close to the cliff edge. He knows he's safe because he can see better from his vantage point. Sherry is scared and nagging at him to be careful (like my mother, Grandma Mildred, and me). Then, they (we) are driving toward our house and I see a car/truck drive into a pond. Sherry says something about, \"Oh! Guilt!\" like guilt is \"___\" something. I feel sorry for her daughter who has to grow up with this biased and unhealthy view of the world."

I'd like to have my regular joystick back. I'm on a gravelly, steep driveway. When I get to the top, there is a road. I look across and see huge curtains with huge clothespins on a wire. The construction company has put them up so we can't see what they are doing. I see canopy roofs of cloth that matches the curtains over train cars and buildings. I am concerned what are they doing that requires protection like that, and are they protecting us as well? I doubt it. I decide to go check out my new house. I stop at the door and stand, walking in, thinking (hoping) I had enough energy to manage without the chair. My \"roommate\" comes to the door and gives me a tour (see drawing in the dream book). I enter the kitchen and look, agreeing with her it is small. Where does the stove and refrigerator go? \"Oh, I hate gas,\" I say. Her head is on one of the burners, which is lit. She likes gas stoves, she says, they work well. I worry about leaking gas. I look through a window down to the living room. She says, \"We have to go out this door and around to the door into the living room.\" I say, \"How odd to go outside and around.\" There is a steep ramp and someone is concerned and wants to hold on to me so I don't slip (I'm in slippers). I make it down, slipping a little. She says to me as we walk, \"It must have been wonderful to have time to visit/talk with your mother. I agree and tell her how special and nice it was. \"How do I get in?\" I ask. My roomie is already in and peers up at me through a square, small hole. \"Through that hole?\" I ask. \"Here, why can't I go through this door?\" (a double Dutch door). \"Are you going to put furniture against it?\" She isn't thrilled, but \"OK,\" she says, \"I guess so.\" I can use the door. I go in and look around. It's very spacious. I say, pleased, \"Why there are two, no, three, no, four fireplaces (all in a row) and a piano, no, two pianos?\" I exclaim, \"This is just like in a dream!\" I look at the ornate, green, plush Victorian couches and chairs (overstuffed). She says, \"That's my gun over the piano\" (I see another gun, a rifle). I see pictures up on the wall and think I'll rearrange them to suit me later. I see a photo collage like my \"Germany and Mexico trips\" ones. I see a huge group photo of the people I'm currently working with up the hill. It's too big. I'll take it down, later. I suggest, \"We could create little centers or rooms in all this space. Over there by the window could be the children's play area; and there, your study area, and we could have communication areas here and there.\" She agrees. I ask, \"What's that room out the windows?\" and she says, \"The family room.\" I go out and see it's just an open veranda/porch, not a room at all. A neighbor man waves and starts talking at me. As he walks over, he tells me how he's been hunting for ___ and he names two animals. I don't understand what he called the second animal and he repeats it. (I spell it shire or shrik-mole.) I bend over to hear better and now looking at his head as he talks! (It's on the ground by the porch edge, like he has no body, or he's buried up to his head.) I think to myself, \"I'd better not be so pleasant and open or he'll keep coming over and bothering me.\" I smile my polite, fake smile. I move on to see the end of the porch. I am standing next to a man and a cart of birds that he is plucking. One bird, the one he's working on, is a parrot, not a chicken, and it's very much alive. I feel queasy and don't want to be so close, so I chat with my roomie and try to ignore the process, which is probably painful to the bird. But I can't help but keep one fascinated eye on his hands on the birds legs and the birds eyes as they blink."

Paulina knows there's going to be trouble because the husband is beginning to be attracted to her. She asks me to call Lucy so she can get advice. I have a phone receiver at each ear and am listening to Lucy and Paulina talk. I hear someone pick up an extension and realize the wife is listening in and hope she hasn't heard enough to give it all away. She comes into the room and I hang up the phones. The husband comes into the room and the wife leaves. I have on thigh high black nylons and I show him a dress I've bought that is very short and sexy. He likes it. I put it back in the box and Paulina/me stands to walk out of the room. She is dressed in a simple black wool dress that accents her small waist and slim figure. A kick pleat at the back calls attention to her legs. She's wearing black high heels. The husband is very attracted. Paulina walks out of the room, mincing on the high heels like a Hollywood starlet. I follow her. As she walks down a hall, a good-looking young man sees her and follows her, attracted. She hears boogie woogie music and is going in search of the music to dance. She is sidetracked somehow in a dark hall that has a series of glass tanks like for reptiles or fish. People are in the bottom tank, trapped. She watches as they dig up to the top layer tank, but it has fish and water in it, no oxygen, so they dig further to the next bottom tank and then up. This time there is a black poisonous snake in the top tank and oxygen. A man standing next to me on my left is also watching. He casually picks up the snake to hold it while the people break through into the snake's tank. I say, \"Be careful!! He's very poisonous.\" The man is not at all concerned and holds it like a pet and lets it writhe around his hand and arm, only carelessly paying attention to where the head is. Then the snake tries to bite the boot of the man and hits the floor with drops and a shooting spray of the white poison. \"See,\" I say, \"Look out.\" The man ignores me. The snake is sheathed from neck to tail in segments of cloth that serve as bandages. but are almost like clothes. The people manage to get to the oxygen so I leave and now see Paulina bouncing down the hall to the music. She almost passes the door where they are taking tickets. She hurries in and I follow. She goes across the room past an empty, carpeted dance floor where young collegiate guys are hanging out, and sits. As I reach where she is, I see she's changed her mind and has gone to sit in the middle on rows of chairs. She sits and lays two coats on the empty chairs to her right. The young man who followed her sits in a row in front of those two chairs with the coats. I sit on one of the coats next to Paulina. Now the dance instructor is there and she's talking the us and she nonchalantly takes all her clothes off as she lectures. Everyone is very shocked. I am queasy because I see her breasts and the nipples are sliced off. The red part is very large and where the nipples should be is a cavernous hole like in a thunder egg. It made me hurt just looking at it. Her body is not particularly pretty and the young college men are shocked and not too thrilled. She says that the body is a natural thing and should be treated that way; hence, she does not wear clothes."

I look and realize it is hanging out of my swim suit and is old, shrunken, with a nasty rash on it. I am embarrassed and shamed. I tuck it back in saying, \"I need a new swim suit.\" Now, I am in bed with Howard and another woman. I am in the middle. We are all sleeping. It is late at night after a party and in his dorm room. We are naked. I sleep pointed toward him, laying on my stomach, almost like I was hinting he could approach me, but pretending I was just sleeping. He sleeps. He gets up and leaves. I turn my body so it is pointing to the sleeping woman. I feel funny about that and change my position. She leaves. I am alone and I see two college men with mop buckets and brooms open the door. They have clean-up duty in the dorm, and when they see me they quickly close the door. I continue to lie there. I know that they are plotting to come in and rape me because if I am naked in the bed in a men's dorm, I must be a loose woman and up for grabs. They come back in grinning broadly and evilly, pretending to mop and clean. I pick up the small, old-fashioned black phone and dial 911, just in case. Ethan's voice comes on the line announcing some place of business. I put my finger on the phone to break the connection but talk like I'm calling 911. The men decide to leave. I quickly get up, finding my bra on the side table. I look in the mirror and see I'm still dressed, except I don't have my bra on. so I carry it. I go into the small bathroom to brush my teeth with Howard's brush and use Howard's hair pick. My hair is wet like I'd showered and I pick at it to try and dry it some. I'm in a hurry and anxious. I hear little boys singing outside the window, \"Whore, whore, whore.\" I see the wooden shutter is partly open and I try to hook the eye hook lock on both sides. It is hard. Then I leave. As I open the door to the hall, lots of college men are mopping the floor and I step quickly over the wet spots and hurry out.

She sees a line and wants to join it but I say that's the line for people trying to get in, but we're all ready in. We walk around to another side of the pool and I lie on my back and do the back stroke as she lies on my belly. I am very careful not to spill her off me or let the water wash her overboard. I swim three or four strokes to the deep end, turn and do the same number of strokes to the middle part. Back and forth we swim. Now she's a child and I am writing letters on her wet suit for her. It spells \"Doctor Day...\" Her father comes in and she says, \"How do the letters look?\" He says cheerfully, \"Good, but, dear, the T is a little crooked.\" I say, annoyed with him for being critical and not just supporting the little girl's happy feelings of wanting to impress him, \"I wrote those letters.\" He is embarrassed. The letters are upside down because I'd been standing at the head end of the suit when I wrote them. Now I am sewing a zipper pouch to the suit.

I'm feeling pretty happy, and busy. I'm getting ready to go to a rehearsal or performance. I gather up a notebook I have and put in two of my favorite pens only to discover there are lots of pens in the notebook already. I remove three or four fat markers; most of the pens are black. Now it's time to go. I go find my \"husband.\" He's filing things. I smile indulgently because my work is important, but his is more like a hobby. He buys Tupperware and sells it. He's unpacking boxes. I look in a box and see cute miniature boxes and glass jars that are pretty. I say to him, \"I like Tupperware, but I hate the selling part.\" I also comment that I shouldn't take these cute things because even though I think they are pretty, I'll not be able to find any way to use them. I can't think of any tiny things I could put in them that would be useful to me. So we put my files and his boxes in the pickup truck and we drive away. I am driving. We have a hitchhiker and his belongings in the back of the truck, also. I see we're in trouble, the road abruptly ends, so I drive us over the edge to jump the chasm and successfully land on a grassy spot near the river. The hitchhiker's things end up falling in the river but my \"husband's\" things and mine are still safe in the truck. The hitchhiker is very mad at us. We dismiss his concerns as being unimportant. We feel sorry he lost his things, but we had done the best we could, so why is he mad at us? It wasn't our fault. We want to go get help, but don't want to leave the things unattended for fear he will take revenge and steal our things or ruin them. The women (two of us) go for help. The men (two) wait, guarding our things."

I am embarrassed and don't want Jerome to find out, so I pull off the sheets to wash them. I find a small sheep skin and stuff in there too. I take it all to wash. I go down the hall to find the washers. A man I don't like says he's been transferred to another school. I smile and say, \"Good for you. Congratulations.\" He says, \"I'm surprised you're so pleasant, I didn't think you liked me.\" I didn't have the courage to say I don't. \"I'm just glad you're leaving.\" I feel surprise because he's aware that I don't like him. I go into the room with the washer and dryer. I put the things in and now I think I only need to dry them. Bonnie is around and I want her advice. I go to take the stuff out of the machine and pull out my top hat from B's Follies, and 12 baby booties. There are some other things too. I go back and put the clean sheets on his bed and hope he won't notice. I start to leave. Only as I get to the door of the building, Jerome walks up and says, \"Hi.\" He goes into his room and I walk down the sidewalk, hoping to get away. Jerome calls after me and I stop. I am aware that I am dressed very nicely, a yellow suit and nylons. Jerome has figured out I did that and is now wanting to go out with me. He suggests we go for a drive in his sports car. I don't want to. He's married and I didn't do his sheets so he would like me, I did them to hide my wrong doing, but I get in the car anyway. It's very low to the ground and I say, \"I hope I can get out again.\" I'm in the passenger side and as we go, I notice it's hard to see up and over the dashboard. Jerome is very suave and flirty. Now I'm in the back seat and high school friend Dora is in the front next to Jerome. He calls her Betty, twice. We stop at a Mexican restaurant. I groan because I don't like Mexican food; It's too spicy. He says they have rooms in the basement, meaning a motel like place and I can see the handwriting on the wall. I don't want to have an affair with him, but I go in anyway."

I am annoyed because it is Aunt Rosalie's baby and now I have to take care of it. I hope she comes back soon. It crawls out and I have to retrieve it back into the car. Later, I watch a young blonde woman taking care of her baby. It is rambunctious and tries the mother's patience, but I am impressed with how patient and kind the young mother is. She talks soothingly and is aware the baby is just doing what it's supposed to do and she lays near it so she can keep it out of trouble as it explores its world. Now I see the skyline of Paris. I see the palace, the Eiffel Tower and a third thing (a landmark). I point this out to a taxi driver. I try to say \"palace\" and realize I mean \"museum.\" I say \"meuseo,\" like in French. He gets it. I'm a tourist and I'm going sightseeing. Now I am inside the old T City house showing the girls where my Grandmother Mildred raised her children, my past. The rooms are all changed and more spacious and modern and I keep pointing out to the girls that it wasn't this good when I lived there. The girls seem unimpressed. \"Three bedrooms,\" they say. But, I say, \"There were nine people and one of the bedrooms was added on later.\" We look in one bedroom. I wonder what kind of bed will be there. It is a pretty, brass frame double bed with yellow and white ruffly bedspread. Oh, this is Doreen's room that had been renovated for her more modern tastes. I had expected to see a single, plain bed. We go to the kitchen. In the hall before the kitchen I look in an open closet space and notice it's empty now. That's where they kept the dead, like the baby. In the kitchen, I look around for the current caretaker of this place. I see four sinks and think, \"Just like in a dream, repetition.\" I see a pantry. I can't get back out because the stove and a cabinet have slid together. I say, \"How do I get out?\" One of my girls pushes them apart and we get through. I see a letter I had written the caretaker from Paris, telling them we'd be here on this date to see the old place. I wonder where they are and decide they left to give us time and space to review the past alone. Now I go outside and it's a huge dune at the beach. I walk up it very laboriously, sliding down a lot. I make it to the top only to see a huge dune sand worm (like in DUNE movie) rearing up. I turn and slide down the dune in terror. It chases me. I bury myself in the sand so it won't see me, at first fully under the sand but can't breathe, so I unbury my face."

Then, I choose to go out even farther than they dare, to the really big waves that are wild and deep. I have some trouble but make it in, I crash and get back up, sand all over me and in my mouth. I carry my board and go to a standing shower head and rinse myself off and drink the water, spitting it out to clear out the sand. As I am showering, a huge crowd of ordinary \"tourists\" come by, all carrying huge black spears. They trample my surf board and I interrupt them and pull by board to safety. I then cleverly point them to another beach so they won't infest the surfing beach. They go on. Now I meet the male leader of the surfers who is almost growling at me. He doesn't like me or rather his territory has been invaded. I coolly stand up to him. #2, James, is warmly proud of me. I then try to decide if I am going to surf at low tide and do a surf estuary.

Now I'm really scared because I'm trapped in this crazy room. I see some pills on the floor and run suddenly to get them. The man tries to get them before I do, but I scoop them up in my hands. He could easily take them out of my hands and I know that. I edge away, hoping my helper man comes back soon. I feel frozen with fear because if my helper man doesn't return from his hunt.

I see they printed my name exactly as I sent it, with errors and not in very large print. I realize I should have taken more care in the finishing details. What you see is what you get, I guess. I go look at a Life magazine. The front cover is moving pictures that look real. It's a bunch of tiny newborn male monkeys that are translucent, they are so new. The headline says, \"UGH.\" The article is about how immature males are and we now have clinical proof with these monkeys. They lack a female hormone so they don't mature till much later than females. I think, \"Huh, that explains why they act so immature.\" I go through a series of rooms, looking for someone, maybe my wife because now I'm Howard. He/I are sort of hiding from some authorities, perhaps medical or military. He/I goes up a circular tube cloth thing and squeeze through the small opening at the top. Now we are hidden in the second story area. But now the authorities are gone so he/I squeeze through and go down, in a hurry before someone thinks this tube is empty and uses it. He/I goes from room to room looking for my wife. We find her. There is some picture, maybe in a magazine, of a red plastic heart. It may be an advertisement. There is a son, a small boy."

I notice that the driver is also in the back seat, with steering wheel and buttons there. I look in the front where there is also a steering wheel and lights and buttons that the boys are pretend driving with. It isn't functional though. We go and arrive at a house, possibly my parents'. I come in. The driver hands me a pie. I start to eat it - whipped cream and so on. My mother notices the meat chunks in the pie (like turkey or chicken hearts or gizzards) are not done yet, nearly raw. I remember the driver had not cooked it for very long, so she goes to cook it a bit more. My father is disappointed and leaves. Now I see a fan going to a room where Elvis is. He wants Elvis to autograph his orange. Elvis is rude, selfish, spoiled and arrogant. He pokes the pen into the orange and growls a few sarcastic words at the fan (male). I go in next and ask him to autograph my orange. Elvis would like to have an affair with me but I spurn him with some contempt. I tell him what I think of him."

He didn't mean to cause trouble and this is all too much. The man's left arm hangs useless. It's hurt (like the bus driver last night), but the alien doesn't believe him. So the lion attacks and the man fights with a metal hook thing with his one arm. It's a touch and go battle but finally the man whams the lion on the head enough times to nearly kill it. The lion's plastic white eyelids shut so we know he's near death. Once more the hook hits (like Lacrosse or racquet ball) and hooks him in his throat. He dies. The alien is impressed. Now the man explains his predicament:  the door is open, the window broken, the heavy furniture floating and soon he'll hit orbit. The alien apologizes and agrees to help. The alien says, \"I only meant to entertain you. I thought you were out here for a long trip and needed something to break the boredom. I know what that's like! I didn't realize you were only here for a couple of weeks.\" He helps fix things, then the man goes to the kitchen and requests the woman eat/smoke/drink particular things so he can enjoy that flavor.

There are words knitted into the waist band, something about enjoying the outdoors and river rafting.

It is potentially dangerous and we dive in and swim frantically, but not afraid. After a while, we see a pasture and farm buildings on the left bank. The fence is open and we swim over and get on land, deciding that this might be the prudent thing to do as we don't know how much worse the river will get around the bend. We walk toward the buildings and on my left I see lots of objects lined up and I think excitedly, \"How interesting, dream symbols.\" I wonder what they mean and I try to look at each one and remember what was there so I can write them down [I don't remember now what they were]. Then we see a big blackboard. We're visiting a classroom which is in this huge pasture area. On the blackboard the words, \"The vertical cannot be seen until the horizontal is understood\" are written and then I see drawn pictures of furniture where I can see the vertical lines and barely make out the horizontal ones. I am very impressed at the message from my dream and feel a moment of great insight. Now we are observing the class. I see a young boy and say, \"I'll bet I can guess your age.\" I'm about to guess 5th grade when he says, \"High school.\" I tell him I used to be a 3rd grade teacher and was glad I didn't show up my ignorance by guessing his age. I see some boys resting on mats on the floor for nap time. I place an object by one boy. I think I am returning it to him after looking at it. Then I share a couch with a girl. I curl up on it. There's not much room for me. I watch as the 3rd grade teacher, male, takes my daughter Dovre outside to play flute and music. The class is well behaved, everyone doing what they are supposed to be doing. Some of them look out the window at Dovre and the teacher. The teacher comes in with his face in a frown and a toothpick in his mouth. Someone comments that he's mad and you can tell because of the way his mouth is closed around the toothpick. He is annoyed with the students and I am surprised because I thought them well behaved. He didn't, however, and reprimands them to get back to what they are supposed to be doing."

Two families have been split up. We are black. I feel sadness that I am split from my little girl, but relieved that I still have my boy. Now the bad guy is a nurse and I am a patient, in a hospital bed. She is mixing a nasty, poisonous, brown concoction that looks like liquid shit. She is going to kill me. My boy, dressed like an orderly with a mask over his mouth, comes in as the nurse goes into the bathroom to wash off the poison from her hands. He makes himself known to me and tells me where the poison is and not to drink it. So I am to refuse the big pills and he will spill the brown liquid. I insist on taking my usual pills, the cortisone and hormones, and they get stuck in my throat because I take them all at once. The boy tells a woman to get the tomato juice ready and warns me not to try this. I am stubborn. Even though he tells me I might have to drink the poison to get the pills down, I swallow and swallow and they get stuck and I drink the juice and get them down. The other woman is Gracie Allen and she says \"Well, George, I guess I'll have to buy her a drink after we get out of here.\" I smile. The boy spills the brown stuff after I pretend to drink some. We have foiled the bad guys."

On the stage is a group of men playing rock music. One is particularly attractive. He says he will kiss one of the disabled people. I go up quickly to the edge of the stage and he comes down on the floor and picks me up in a lavish body dancing dip posture and exaggerates a kiss. I play along dramatically. As we finally kiss, I realize he is wearing a wooden mask with a small hole for the mouth and he \"tongues\" me through the hole. He whispers his apology and says that later we will really kiss. I feel frustrated, but try my best to kiss real good. Our tongues touch. I go back to my seat. Now the group resets up their stage setting on the floor right in front of me. They have a play they will do and create fold-out sets and costumes in a wardrobe, within a foot of where I sit. I am excited I will get to see things so close. He asks how many disabled there are in the audience. They yell or raise their hands. There are a few. I change to my power wheelchair to dance with him. [BL]"

Run here.\" I hear his scared tone and don't know why he's scared, but I obey, and as I run, huge waves of the ocean rush toward me and the rock and I narrowly escape being sucked out to sea by the tremendous backwash or riptide. I climb up the rocky bank and join the man. He and I stand very close together, me trying to get him to kiss me and him resisting in a shy, pure way. We walk to my room.

We get to the top floor and see Bonnie, who is taking classes at the University where we are. She goes on her way. I now follow Merle to a stairwell, looking for the elevator, but can't find it. I end up in a room where a couple of workers are. They show me my wheelchair and I say, \"Wait, where are my extenders?\" (for the foot pedals, only I am looking for tip rods or extended brake levers).

I see my old chair and start to take my things out of a fanny pack on the side arm. Then I want to take the fanny pack off too. I have trouble, so this guy comes up to help. I am now standing next to a good-looking man in his forties. He has beautiful blue eyes, wrinkles on his face and wears workman jeans. He stands close to me, smiling, and he tries to stand taller. He's a few inches taller than I am, which pleases me. I like a man that height. As we chit chat, he holds my hand and I smile like a teenager in love. We talk about wheelchair games and other wheelchair people and how good they are at athletics. Even when he needs to do some detail work, he holds my hand. I don't want to break the connection. The other co-workers are looking at us askance. They are surprised and grinning. Merle shows up again to lead me back. I reluctantly let go of Nathan's hand. We part and I follow Merle, aware of Nathan watching as I walk well, seeming not to need a wheelchair. There is no elevator, so Merle says, \"Go this way, but be careful of swinging things that could hit your head.\" \"What?\" I exclaim, \"...then I won't go that way.\" I try to see my way out but decide I'd try the other way instead. I look in and see he means a series of metal things in triangular shapes on a conveyor belt. There is steam there as well, and it is close to where I enter the door. I hesitate, watching, and then ducking in, holding my hand up to protect my face. After I'm in, I see there is no more danger and I walk to a stack of boxes I slide down like they are giant stairs. I'm pretty adept and agile and hope Nathan is watching. Merle is jealous. I ask Merle about Nathan, saying, \"He seems like a nice guy.\" Merle mumbles something and I ask him to repeat it three or four times. I finally figure out he said, \"Nathan has just joined the gay community.\" \"Just my luck,\" I mutter, feeling ripped off. I find my chair among many others and ask for the bill. They say $450. \"What?\" I ask frustrated. They shrug and wait. I say, \"You quoted me $250.\" They shuffle and look embarrassed. I am angry. They did it to me again; they snookered me in. I wait, feeling like a turd for insisting they give the tires at the price they quoted me. After all, they did so much work, but I'm feeling it is unfair to me.

There is a line of parked bicycles in front of me and I look in the rear view mirror to see if any are behind me because I don't want to run over any. I start to back up. I now realize I'm on a side road next to a freeway, I can see the car headlights passing by. So I am backing up and have trouble seeing out the back mirrors. It's a narrow gravel road near a river and I hope I don't go over the edge into the river. At one pint I am turning and see I've gotten right to the edge and my motor dies. I grab the wheel and yank it back the way I'd been and narrowly escape going over the embankment. So I continue to back up, trying hard to see the road. The car is hard to stop and I use the brakes and barely keep it from going too fast. Now I'm going down hill. I use the brakes and it isn't enough, so I put it in reverse.

I think, \"This is foolish to be out there all alone.\" Now a black car with no lights is pacing me. This feels ominous. I have trouble seeing where the road is and the edge of the road. The car falls back. No other lights are seen and I wonder if I'm still on the freeway, perhaps a side two-lane highway. Now a man gets out of the car and is walking up to me. I try to ignore him. He wants to talk. I'm worried he's going to rape me or hurt me. I keep going. He wears a dark coat. He says, \"I'm a writer.\" I say, \"So am I,\" hoping to discourage him from asking me to read his work. Then he pulls out two guns and says, \"I have two guns.\" I take them and feel their weight; they seem light like they are fake and I toss them into the bushes. Now he's mad at me. I show him I have a gun too. \"Where did you get that?\" he asks. He digs in the bushes for his guns, which are easy to find as I didn't throw them hard. I keep walking. I see the lights of a small town ahead and am relieved. I look for a sign that says Police Station. I see one and turn to go there. The man goes into a store/gas station. I stop at another gas station where three men are standing around. I ask one where the police station is and he points and says, \"Over there.\" I say, \"Where?\" He decides to take me.

Then I see another man, a neighbor, wearing the same outfit in blue and laugh and laugh at them. Ernie grins and goes to the ocean and sort of hops and dances around. I keep my eye on him and then I've lost him. I turn and \"Fox,\" a beautiful silver-colored dog/wolf rushes toward me and growls a wild challenge. He was supposed to stay in, but I wasn't about to stop him and he leaps out the window and runs. Ginny comes up and leans out the window and I look and see tables with lots of people sitting to eat the hamburgers the clown chefs were making.

Ginny (now Katrina) sees some spots and says, \"We'll need to clean this better.\" It has a sign on it, a paper cup with the words \"Recycle Me\" over some spots, meaning that it is too much to clean, leave it, but Katrina won't be stopped. She tells the guys to get the paint. Two men, one shy and homely, come in and I start to walk away. Katrina whispers, \"You can't go.

I yank him around and am dragging him off to my office to give him a talking to. I say to someone, \"You come with me, I don't want to be alone in the room with him,\" but the person says, \"I have to do something\" and leaves. I yell for a student, a girl, and I say, \"Get me Judith or any woman counselor, quick.\" The student starts edging away as I keep a hold on his shirt and I notice one leg is an amputated stump. I yank him back and say, \"Oh no you don't.\" Now another man, a counselor, comes toward me and tries to bump us with a cart/table. I say, \"What are you doing?\" He says, like a mad man, \"I am your father figure,\" and runs the cart up against me. I push back and manage to grab a bunch of his wiry blonde hair out of his head and I say \"Well, you are going bald\" (the hair reminds me of Blake). He keeps after me and I now am running away from him, dragging this poor student with me. I race through the room where the students are, they are getting ready for the meeting and someone says, \"It's 7:30, get ready for the meeting,\" and two of them are upset because they will miss Star Trek. I have a great idea and, in the middle of this chase, collar a kid and say, \"Make a suggestion in the meeting that everyone come up with $.50 and chip in and buy a VCR so they can tape stuff and watch it later.\" They like that idea. I see Howard; he left my check where he had been sitting. It had numbers written on it like he was figuring out some bills. He takes it and says, \"Oh no you don't,\" and finds a phone to call someone about details. I continue running and I see the mad man still after me and gaining fast. He's holding on to some toy and it is dragging him across the floor fast. It almost catches up and I see it's not the mad man but one of the kids that had been teasing me."

Then I say, \"We are going to learn about cooperation if it takes all day.\" I role play a quarrel. \"This is a quarrel,\" I say and play-act two people arguing angrily. I say, \"Yes, that is scary; anger is scary, but let's study it and learn. It's a natural emotion,\" and so on the lecture goes. Now my name is Ms. Woods and I am an old teacher of high school kids. They are marching in two converging columns. There had been some insults from one group to the other and I force my kids to march right into the other group and deal with things rather than ignore it. The principal respects what I did and says, \"You made us face it.\" A smart-mouthed teen runs by and I go after him and say, \"Just a minute, boy, I'm Ms. Woods. You will, if you intend to go to this school, walk with respect for other people,\" and so on. I catch another errant young man and do the same. I patrol the front door to catch others. Now I'm in the passenger side of a car and on a remote fix to a radio station. I am to announce the coming of an important mass like it's a rock concert. \"But,\" I say to my driver, \"it sounds like Los Angeles out here.\" So, he says, \"Announce it like an L.A. mass.\" He starts jiving in the microphone as we drive up a set of stairs to where the mass is being held. He says, \"Come on now, it's grooving; ever heard of Matthew Fox?? All the big guys are here, it's happening.\" We go in and then go up and out to the top of bleachers. The audience is waiting for the show. The first rock star comes down the steps following his prostrate and sad two wives and their children. I shake my head at their stupid act. Someone seated next to me says he's going to smoke pot and his friend says he hasn't any and will have to borrow money at a high rate to get some, but he doesn't have any choice. I laugh at that. \"No choice?\" I say, \"You could choose to not smoke!!\" A woman and I throw candy bits we bought for $3.00 to kids hiding under the bleachers. I write my name on the candy so they know who threw it. Someone got a phone call and says, \"OK,\" gets up and puts on an army uniform from British last century with a huge plume in the hat. He has to go ask the Queen of England who wants to talk to the post office lady for ID which will require her getting her picture on video tape. \"She's not going to like this,\" he sighs."

The pleasurable tension of being close but pretending to be indifferent is great. We find a room, a \"library,\" and he says, \"Is this ok?\" I say, \"I don't know. What if someone comes in?\" Just then, Merle comes in and interrupts. He is jealous. Now we leave, and \"Fox\" signals to me to go around the house to the side and go in there. I walk around the block and up a hill and see G walking stiff-legged down a ladder. He wants to know where I am going and I don't want him to know. He follows me. I see people on the 2nd floor of the house. It's a woman and a man getting married, or engaged. Then the woman changes her mind and chooses to marry her pregnant lesbian girlfriend. I see the ceremony and after the vows, the mother of the bride, the two women and the man all dance together. I say, \"I really like that!\" Merle isn't impressed, and disagrees. Now, Fox and I are walking, looking for a place to be alone. Our need for each other is great. It's so wonderful just being with him. But there is another interruption. A mentally retarded young woman wants me to take her picture and hands me the camera. I try and focus through a tiny little square and only get part of her face, and I back up and she keeps putting her fingers in her mouth and stretching out her lips. (I am somehow reminded of Rena.) I try and snap a shot when she wasn't posing and actually was pretty. I take four snaps and then we go on. Now I am an \"extra\" in a movie scene. Fox is the star and to be near him, I am in the scene. So are hundreds of extras. Our job is to writhe around and pretend panic, fear and agony. I am amused to see two male experienced actors chatting about mundane things as they look the part of fear and panic. I try to remember to contort my face good. The number 7 is the star part. If you are #7, you are in the movie for sure. Now we are going to walk away and find a place to be alone. My mother, angry, comes striding purposefully toward us to disapprove and interfere. Two men come toward her to ward her off and protect us. She says, \"You shouldn't go with him. I would choose alcoholics or addictive persons or sugar daddies to go to my house.\" I say, \"If that's what you want, go ahead. I don't want to hang out with people like that.\" We go off together and she's fuming."

I see Fox and he's coming to me with a girl and I realize that girl is me, in a younger time. Her hair is brown, mine is blonde. Fox can see me, but she can't. The three of us shower together.

I then realize that Lydia and Valerie are too easily susceptible and will believe in this man and that will be dangerous for them. I try to get us to move away from the crowd and away from the leader. There is a hypnotic quality to his delivery and it is hard to pull away. Now we have gone up a mountain and are at a spiritual retreat. Again, I feel the hypnotic pull and try to resist. They have a new recruit that has volunteered to be the gate. Her name is Joy and she just graduated from high school and is 18 years old. She is very naive and innocent. Someone says they would hate to use the joy gate, because \"Can you imagine what it would be like to rip open the gate from the mountain and it's a person named Joy?\" I see rocks falling as an image of this gate opens. I must leave, and I get in my van with Dwight and I drive, trying to escape the mountain. As I drive, I see that the road curves up ahead and I force the van off the paved road and drive across the field, where a barely noticeable dirt trail is. It was hard to leave the paved road. I turn and look back and see a steam vent gush on the mountain near the small collection of buildings that is the spiritual retreat community. I wonder if it is blowing up. I turn back and keep going noticing that the trail is gone and the grass is wet and muddy and we could get stuck. I push on anyway. Now, I am pedaling a bicycle, with Dwight riding on the back. We turn to the right and go past some construction. The road is muddy. We then go down a steep hill and are on the water's edge, through a lot of muddy puddles. I wonder if I'm even going the right way, or if I shall have to turn back and backtrack. Wasted time and energy. Then, I want Dwight to help pedal. I see a police car directing the detour traffic ahead and I go toward them to ask for directions. I hear a Frank Sinatra tune being sung, \"My Girl.

I try to see where I am going and I march in the snow and ice and nearly go over the edge of an abyss. My partner on the trek stops me just in time, by accident really, not aware we are on the brink of sliding off the edge and down a huge fall to a meandering river. The staff I use to walk with nearly goes through the snow at the cliff's edge. I back up, still unaware and find a tent. We decide to stay in it, but first I use a flashlight to look out and over the river far down below. I use the arc of the light to show where I think the bad guys are. I see a snow bar across the river, a waterfall and so on. My partner gets worried and insists I turn the light off because it will lead the bad guys right to us. I am oblivious to danger and we go into the tent. Soon the men are around the outside and we must defend ourselves. The big man has a leather glove on his hand and a long whip, and he is outside the tent whipping around trying to find us in the dark in the tent. I finally, like a bantam rooster, grab the whip and pull on it until I've wrestled it out of his hand, glove and all. Now I am whipping at him fast and competently. He's rather amazed. I go outside and continue whipping. A small \"robin bird\" goes in and someone says, \"Stop him, he'll get hurt.\""

I try to open a bottle of mineral water and it fizzes all over and then I swallow and swallow, trying to get it down. Finally it dislodges and goes down. I feel queasy, thinking about all that plastic and bristles in my insides. Then, a very short policeman comes right up to me. I thought he was hugging me, so I hug him back and then I realize he thinks I'm deaf and is leaning in to shout in my ear (my deaf one).

She is newly assigned to this staff and coming to meet them. The man who runs the place meets her coming up the sidewalk and falls for her before knowing she is newly on staff. He wouldn't have liked her if he'd known. They lie down on a couch/bed and cuddle. They love each other very much. They cuddle spoon fashion and then the man grows into a huge giant monster and the woman is sad and afraid. He goes out into the streets toward a special lake where others of his kind lurk. He is dangerous. She follows. She is in the lake and feels a giant spider coming up underneath her and is afraid. She lets the spider see the other people and the baby in the hopes that that will divert the spider from eating her. It does and the woman feels guilt for sacrificing the other people for her own survival. Now a huge giant snake surfaces, a boa constrictor. It comes at her face with a wide open mouth to bite. It narrowly misses her and starts to wrap around her and she knows that even though she is powerful, she will be strangled and crushed by this huge snake. She hopes the snake will go off and find others to eat. It does.

I wonder if they are drug dealers and watch, hoping Kylou doesn't get in trouble. She is in the group and having fun, laughing. I stand nearby. The police come and it appears I am in the group and they arrest me. I try to explain the circumstances. He has cold blue eyes, very good looking, with a police mask or helmet on so all I can see are his eyes and cheek bones. He arrests Kylou and I try to defend her, saying she wasn't a part of this. They get very belligerent and I realize that I am in the hands of cold, cruel men and I'd better shut up. He beats me on my face and then handcuffs me and puts me in the back of the car. I know to resist will get me more pain. I sit there, angry and scared. They are in the front seat and a sheet of glass is between us. I see two packages, one for each one, and see their names. The one in the passenger side is called Dukie. The driver is Reynold or something like that. Then I take a Kleenex and press it to my upper lip. I see blood from the beating and tuck the Kleenex into my waistband of my skirt for evidence. Then I press a leather bag thing they used to beat me with and see the blood forms Reynold's name and this is even better evidence. I hide it too, hoping they won't find it later when they search me. Now I am in my cell and a woman prisoner comes in to beat me up. I know I have to resist and I know it will be painful. She's claiming territory. She's pushy and threatening (arrogant). She puts a gauze muzzle on me that covers my whole face like a dog muzzle thing and she is going to beat me. Just then one of her guards or henchmen tries to get her attention to show her this magnificent puppet theatre I have in my cell. She won't be interrupted until almost too late. Just as she is ready to hit me, she turns and sees it and leaves me to admire it. Now somehow I am saved. I have status. This thing had been sent to me by friends on the outside. I also have a beautiful coffee server set, clear glass cups and pot, lots of other pretty things too. Now my cell is The Place To Be. I have power. It's like a minimum security place and sometimes I have to hide the things when the guards come by, but mostly, no problem. The guards come by and my things -- three statues or puppets -- are live men and they turn and hide in a crumbled group in a corner. The woman guard comes in and sees my groovy sports bra and sneers. She wouldn't wear one like that. I have one and I see how shapely it makes me. She is envious. Now I am following her down the hall, going for some meeting or interview."

I smile again at the dog, sort of absentmindedly, and he automatically jumps up and raises his paw to be shaken again. Then Barry sees a male friend of his in a beret hat. They greet. Barry asks him, \"How are you?\" He says, \"Fine.\" They talk. Then Barry asks about particulars and he says he lives with ____, a man. Barry says, \"Oh, roommates,\" like he's remembering his girlfriend guiltily. I now am walking with the man and listening to him talk. \"Are you still in elementary education?\" I ask. He says he is.

I'm in the passenger side and am trying to drive and realize that this won't work, so I explain to her and we trade seats.

I find one and sit on a large rock and listen to the beautiful sounds. Now I am somewhere else and holding a baby who is crying and very uncomfortable because she has wet her diapers and her clothes. I lay her down and Aunt Millie and Bonnie are near and we are talking. I shush us and say, \"Now they will think we are visiting,\" like that would be viewed as a bad thing. I try to change the baby's clothes. The diaper is a Pampers kind of thing that is transparent in places and built up in places where it is needed. I get it on, unsure of how to do it. I ask my daughter to get her blanket. I put her in a sleeper and I hold her, realizing she is now asleep. I can tell because her entire body is curled and relaxed like a cat. I know it must feel wonderful for her. I pace, holding her and look for a place to sit down, but every place is filled with people. I am a bit annoyed, but don't want to wake the baby. It feels good to hold her. Now my roommate has two tickets to two evenings of entertainment. I already got my two tickets for Tuesday and Thursday night. Hers is for two other nights. I think of going with her and getting tickets, only then I'd be going out four nights in a row and maybe we'd not get seats together. Some movie star man sits next to another man and I wonder if they are lovers."

I recognize the trees, oddly shaped like my doodles on paper, dry, old and broken. I am impressed with the houses and how wonderful they will look when refurbished. I realize I had forgotten, or chosen not to ride, my wheelchair and I walk back to get it. I stand for a while spacing out and then walk back to see the houses. I realize I had forgotten again to get my chair and walk back and open the passenger door and slide in. Lance rushes up and gets in the driver's side (Lance is black and used to be the city manager assistant to the disability rights city group). I am startled and then laugh as I had tried to slide across to the driver's seat, only he was there. I say, \"Oh, I knew you had gotten in, but, out of habit, I was going to slide over to drive.\" He smiles and says he needs to take the car and go into town to find some information. I am a bit annoyed because he's not asking, just assuming it will be OK to appropriate my car, but I go along with it because it seems interesting. He drives and we talk companionably. He's married and talks about his children. We pull up to a redneck bar and walk in and lean up to the bar. A redneck man on our right says, \"Well, well, look here. A lesbian, and a black man.\" I say, \"Uh oh,\" and we start sidling out of the bar to avoid a fight. We quickly run to the car, and I lock the door on my side, check the lock in the back and unlock the driver's side for Lance. He hops in and almost hits a car parked nearby on the road. We go around it and drive fast. Soon we are in M City like country again and I see Native Americans putting up a tent or teepee. I say with regret, \"I missed the powwow this year.\" Lance leans over and starts to kiss my sleeve affectionately in sympathy, but remembers he's married. I think the gesture is sweet. Lance decides he's going to drive to a man's house and get information on documents he wants. We pull up to a gate, near where the country fair is usually held, supposedly. An Indian man waves us to stop to be inspected. He points demandingly at where we should stop, on the gate like cow threshold. We do. I look up the road and see a group of mobster types eyeing us suspiciously. I say to Lance, \"I'd better stay in my wheelchair (manual) so they won't get confused and suspicious.\" He agrees. We are given permission to enter to get the important information."

The woman teacher I am visiting asks my opinion and I say hesitantly, \"I taught over 20 years ago and this same thing came out then and now I find it sexist and outdated.\" She agrees. It's time for me to leave, but I had lent the books to other teachers so we go down the hall to see if I can get them back. I knew it would be this way. I see students and a few teachers in the hall. One teacher hands me some canceled tickets for H. Center performances. I thank her, thinking it is a good ticket I can use. Then I realize they are torn. Another teacher says, \"I can fix that up for you so they will be usable again.\" We go to her school room. She also shares with me a phone number of some person who will change zeros in bank accounts so you can get more money. I know this is very illegal and decide not to use it, but I take it with me anyway, \"just in case.\" Now I return to the original room I was in. Someone gives me an outfit to change into and pushes me into another room to change. I realize a young man will be coming by and I change to look pretty. I walk out and the teachers shove him into the room like matchmakers and leave. He wears a costume too. We are shy and standing close together. Then he kisses me and we \"accidentally\" fall onto the bed, kissing. The teachers let us sleep together the night and we make love. We are in love. The next morning I must go catch my plane and we start for the airport, sad but resigned; we hold hands. I see a view point up ahead where a magnificent waterfall is and I grab my camera to take some shots. We walk around the corner and I see the harbor. It is beautiful. I take a picture of the bridge structure like Y. Bay Bridge. It moves arts and is cute. Now we walk up slippery metal steps that are flat to get up to the well to see it spout. It is hard going and I say I can't make it. He encourages me and we do make it. As we wait for the spout, I realize I only have one more picture left on the roll and I want a picture of him to take with me, but I want one of the waterfall too, so we walk back down to put him in front of the waterfall. As I try to frame him in the shot, a beautiful dark- haired woman flirts with him and I try to keep her out of the picture. She laughs and says, \"What's the matter, afraid of the competition?\" I say, \"No, go ahead, go for it,\" knowing he would stay true to me. I get a shot of him. Now we go on and suddenly he pulls me down a side street and takes off his police uniform. He's going to defect from the service and I'll stay in Alaska with him."

I pick up a calculator-like thing and push a button out of curiosity. A male voice comes on a message machine from a bank. I can't get it to stop. I push buttons, read directions, etc. and can't figure it out. I ask them and they try. I look for Doug. He will know but he's eating an apple and walking down some stairs. I go to the top of the stairs and look down. I see he's dropped his brief case in the green ocean water in the room below and he is swimming, while still biting on his apple, to get it. I hope he's OK because he's partially blind. He feels his way out, pushing aside the fallen leaves. I wonder how come the water is allowed in the room; the nice wood floor will get ruined. He comes back and I turn and walk back in, not wanting him to know I watched. I now pick up a baby and notice it has hair in its mouth. I pull some out, wondering if the baby bites people's hair and then can't spit it out. I find more and more, deeper down the throat, and realize the baby gets hairballs like a cat and we have to get that out of there."

Now I find the drivers. I walk down a steep embankment through a crowd of people gathered to watch some event or construction job. I see ropes on the ground and ask what they are for. I see men working down the hill with the ropes. I move fast and wonder if I might have been better off taking the more gentle slope further on, but I make it and find the rows of bikes at the \"bike pool\" (like a motor pool).

She gets on and off we go down the bike lane of the freeway. I wonder if she's good enough to keep balance. I wonder if I know how to relax and keep balance. We chat. She tells me of her mother having another relationship with this kind of man who beats her or something bad. I say, \"Oh yes, people repeat their patterns.\" I'm not surprised, then Patsy turns off the road toward a snow field and a large bump. She plows on ahead and just as we crest the top of the bump. I look down and see we are about to plunge off the precipice into a grand canyon-like dropoff. We are dead and in terror, we turn desperately and by some miracle, we actually avoid falling. We are stunned and shocked and hurriedly move away back to the road. We would have been killed. I said, \"Someone wants us alive,\" meaning God. \"Thank you,\" we pray fervently. We vow to look and be more careful from now on. We are so grateful and humbled by the experience. Pat says, \"I'll bet this one goes in the dream book!\" Somewhere in the dream I look at photos and see one of Pat and Amy cooking something in a kitchen and looking at the camera like someone had just called their names and they looked up, seeing the camera and mugs for it, surprised."

I wonder why I do this. She won't want to buy, but it seems important to be honest. In the later dream, I go around the rooms asking where he is; I want to watch him creating a story because I can learn from this. I enter a room where the boys of the band are watching TV and ask if he's there. One says yes. I see him laying on the floor watching a movie he's made. He looks over to see our reactions to his acting. I go lay down to watch with him and notice I lay down a few feet away from him. This is the first time in our intense relationship where some small distance was OK. I move a drying toddler's outfit off a wire and lay it on the floor so I can see the TV better. I feel it (it's corduroy material) to see if it's dry. It is. Earlier a woman came to sing for him. She's good and I take her videotape to him.

My Aunt Naomi and I are walking in the waves and I hear them hissing and swelling and she's concerned for me like the waves are too big and will knock me over. I look and see they are normal height and ignore her warnings to come in closer to shore. I am a bit annoyed at her for being unnecessarily concerned."

He turned to his wife and says, \"Let's go see it.\" She is upset and says, \"You go, I can't.\" He's upset. Why can't she go? She sounds like my mother, annoyed and not willing to be truthful. She says in a passive aggressive way, \"No reason, really.\" I guess if she calls the nurse and sees if an ice pack on her knee will help, she can go. I am tense because it is clear to me as they argue that she's probably on her period and doesn't want to say. Jock keeps pressing her and I restrain my strong urge to interrupt and explain all the unspoken stuff going on. She then asks if I need to go to the bathroom, or I said, \"I guess I'll go home now and not go to the play myself. I need a bathroom.\" \"We'll use mine at the church,\" she says and gets up. What a pain. It's farther but, oh, well, I follow them up a hill along the shoreline. Mud squishes under foot. Now it's a cliff and as I climb up, Jock has a conversation with a young man from the church about a mutual client they work with who is a very evil, dangerous guy. Jock is giving him advice on how to work with him as I now have to go in the tiny, strange door of the church. It's a triangle opening with ropes of twine as a sort of archway opening big enough to stick my foot through. I say, \"This is too small. I don't want to go in.\" Jock encourages me. I sit on the edge of the cliff and gently slide one foot (right) into the opening and squeeze myself slowly through (see drawing). It is easier than I thought it would be. I am surprised."

Oh, now he's going to write bad things about me. I say reassuringly, \"No, now don't take all this personally. Everyone has a mom, it's universal.\" I know I'm lying, but can't figure out how she got insulted by the words \"home and hearth,\" which we slightly argue about the pronunciation of hearth. The next verse has little blow up plastic fruits like apples and bananas. The next verse has a real banana and apple and two wooden, old-fashioned cooking utensils.

I look back and see the dirt road and some people coming out way far back. So I know we are just ahead of everyone else. We continue on. Then we see some wooden houses, white man buildings, and realize that in order to make us comfortable, they have built this little village. We look at each building and admire it. They are cute. Now the Native American man comes to me and suggests I sit with the children during the ceremony rather than in the bleachers with the audience. I agree. He then shows me an ordinary smoking pipe and says if this is handed to me, I must hold it in my cupped hands just as he shows me, or I will offend the gods. I agree and watch carefully. I ask how I should return it after I have taken a smoke. He says, \"Turn it this way (full circle, clockwise) and hand the pipe stem first.\" I listen carefully and nod. The ceremony begins. [BL]"

I stay behind, but now there is room for all of us to dance. I look at them doing a kind of twist and shout dance and feel scorn. That's not the right way to dance with respect for the spirit of the drum. I try to dance Indian. The song is over and the crowd goes away. I stay to watch the drummer who is setting up for the next song. He kicks at the fire he has created to keep it going and asks me to move one of the drums \"over there.\" I pick one drum up reverently and carry it over to where he points. He keeps yelling instructions, but I can't seem to understand where he wants it and I keep doing it incorrectly until he finally yells at me and begins crying. I go to him and say, \"I'm willing to help, but I can't understand what you're saying and there's no need to yell at me.\" He is embarrassed and ashamed and hangs his head and says, \"I know Ma'am.\" He takes the drum and walks away and goes up into a carnival type building. I wait. I look up to see a Disneyland-like train turn and whirl above me. I see a railroad bridge to my left with people sitting along the edge waiting for a ride.

I go into another room and as I'm going down the street in my wheelchair, I see another woman in a wheelchair, a larger woman like Rudean. We travel together for a block or so, bumping over curb cuts and ducking cars. She seems negative. I go into a class, two narrow rows of desks and everyone hurriedly gets up to make room for me. I feel conspicuous, but this is normal. They aren't used to the chair. We get settled in and they are talking about doing a dance and can't imagine how I can participate. I point out to them that I already know how to dance and ask Archie to dance with me to show them. He does some warm up moves and I do too with my chair and spin around and skid to a stop and everyone is impressed and amazed. They and I shove the rugs and furniture aside to make room and then Archie and I dance. It is lovely. At one point he pulls me up to standing and we dance. I then lean into the instructor and incorporate him into the dance. They start relaxing around me. Now another woman is going to share her dance and needs to cast the dancers. She says angrily and sadly that suicide is the end. I say, \"Maybe, maybe not. If the person doesn't learn from it, they die and that's sad, but if they learn and grow from it, it is beautiful.

I get in the passenger side of a brown car with a man driving and we chase, in the woods, up the mountains; we are going fast and side by side. I lean out the window and yell at them, poking the driver with an umbrella. I viciously poke him, trying to get him to stop. He laughs at me.

It was so rare that we all talked like this and really shared our feelings, and we could only do it because all the other relatives were already gone."

I hug him and sooth him and explain that soon a bunch of people in blue robes will come in and it will be OK. We enter the room and walk to the opposite side against the wall. There are no chairs and I wonder how I'll manage standing through the whole thing. Lydia is now on my left and my mother on my right. I see young people walking in randomly with blue robes on and point them out to the boy. There is water about mid-calf height on the floor and I am aware of a hole in front of me and wonder where it is exactly. I worry about it. It moves toward me and I think I'm going to step in it and disappear. My mother ridicules me for being over-concerned and making a fuss. The boy gets down to go to his father. The boy's name is Dickie. Ugh. I think, \"A chip off the old block.\" I decide I must leave the room to insure my safety. I leave and now am in a kitchen-like area. I decide to sleep in the van and now I'm out there; it is a cold, snowy night. A window is open. I order a special sleeping bag from a catalogue that will keep me warm. I notice the van is now in a heated sort of garage room and a horse is there. It loves me intently and wants me to ride it, but I hesitate. He shortens his legs so it's easy for me to get up, he loves me so much. I try to get on over his ample rump, wondering if he'll kick me. He, of course, won't because he needs me so badly. I get on and he grows back up to his normal height. I ride him into the house and decide to take a warm bath. I then get out of the tub, noticing I'm still in the garage room and it is being kept well heated for me at great expense. I hang up a yellow plastic shovel thing on a hook on the wall and remind myself to go get more of those hooks. They are very helpful. My mother is annoyed with me for getting so much special privilege. I go into the kitchen area to the table. I think I assure her I'll clean up after myself. She is disapproving of what I do and how I do it."

            "content": "I am with Dovre and we are at some kind of campground resort area. I am on a bicycle-like thing and am going back to my camp area. There is a center line of broken tree stumps in the road and I ride over them like they are those bumps in the center line. As I turn a corner and get off the bike, I see Michael (of crystals) Ron. He's leaving and I am entering and we pause and wave to each other. I say, \"I'll see you later.\" He says, \"I'm leaving tomorrow,\" and I say, \"I'm leaving tonight. I guess this is goodbye.\" We look at each other uncertainly, wanting to connect, but the moment passes and I walk on. I think about that moment, feeling badly that I didn't say anything to connect later. I just let it pass like I always do, when I'm in automatic. Then, I find a bathroom and see four or five open stalls of toilets and look for the least messy one. Some have leaks and some have turds in them. I squat over a tiny, low bowl and have a bowel movement. I am a bit constipated and it is hard to get it out. A woman comes over and chats with me as I am squatted in this embarrassing position. Then Michael/Ron comes in and it's no longer the bathroom but my campsite. I am laying down and he starts to make gentle, hesitating love to me. I want him to, but I am \"thinking\" it, not feeling it. I french kiss him and wonder why I am anticipating that when I don't particularly like it. He follows my lead. I wonder what I'm doing. Why can't I just relax and feel it, and not be so uptight about performance or what he thinks? Then I remember we are out in the open and wonder if people will see us. Michael/Ron then scoots us off the blanket and under a small table and pulls a blanket over us. I say, \"Oh, don't do that. Now you are in the gravel.\" I want him to be more comfortable, but he says it's OK and picks me up and carries me to his camp site which is more private. I am amazed at his strength, because I am still lying down and covered by this table and blanket. He says, \"Just a minute,\" and goes into a small cabin bed area and then invites me in. I realize this is Claude's bed and feel funny making love to Ron in it when I'd rather be with Claude myself. I go in and lay down. Michael/Ron says, \"Oh, you sat on my eagle button,\" and I realize he and I are wearing army jackets. I am surprised he was ever in the army, being as he's so gentle and new-age. I make a joke about sitting on his eagle and he says it's still cold in here. I feel the coolness and agree. Then I decide to unbutton the jacket. I do it matter-of-factly, wondering why I don't use this obvious opportunity to be sexy and provocative. Later, it's time for me to leave. I try to put things back like they were and pack my things. Michael/Ron says he's going over to his vehicle and put things away. He does. I see gold bangle bracelets and chains for necklaces and wonder if they are Sharon's (Claude's new girlfriend's.) I see toys and I guess they are for her daughter. I feel some jealousy and sadness. Now I go looking for Michael/Ron. I pass a camp trailer/tent that is shaking violently as the two people in it are making passionate love. I laugh at it all because it wasn't so long ago I was with Michael/Ron making love and now these people, oblivious to others, are having at it. I see his van set up and go there. Then I can't find him. The van has turned into a fancy RV. I turn to go back but he calls to me on the road and catches up. Then I see my father. He has come over the mountain on a bus so he can help me drive home over the mountains. I am relieved a bit because I then won't have to drive myself. My father talks of aunts and uncles that are old now and in some places they have to live together in retirement centers. Maybe that's not so bad, I wonder."

He stands very close to me and I feel like I want to melt into his arms, but resist. He wants to know if he stayed two nights and I tell him honestly it was only one night.

He respects that. He's painted small purple squares on my black floor. It makes a nice design. He has to go to the bathroom so he says, \"I'll leave my money and my drugs here with you; guess I'll find out if I can trust you.\" He does. I then leave the room talking to someone, perhaps my husband. I see my 2-year-old son going into the room and follow and see that he's eaten one of the big, colorful pills. I reach my finger in his mouth to get it out and he won't cooperate. I dig around his narrow, clenched mouth and finally force it out. I wonder what kind of scary drug it is, maybe LSD. The man comes back and I tell him what happened. We are more openly in love with each other and can't resist one another. He is less uncouth and I begin to realize he's a talented artist and rich and had been playing a charade to see if I could l love him without the finery. I found out he was an artist because I bumped a book on a chair and a picture fell out and I picked it up. Tempted to open the book and look more, I resolutely don't as that would be an invasion of privacy. We hug and kiss. It is delightful, warm and loving."

I try to stuff all my papers back in the wallet to close it. I get out of the car, but he really wants to talk, to stay with me. Now I'm with a woman nurse who brought me home and we are watching the continuing romance of George and me as it blossoms. How very sweet and poignant.

The car is parked backwards in a steep driveway and the brakes are on, but it starts sliding backward to the garage and I wonder if I could be hurt by being cut in half as the car forces it's way into the garage. It stops and I am OK. I watch George and \"me\" hugging and think it happens that way sometimes, small town, two people get together and the romance and love slowly develops over time.

I think, \"Why is it that the ones I want are flawed and I don't want the ones that want me?\" I get up to leave. I am a younger, virginal woman from a foreign country, maybe India. Kirk follows me and he wants to make love, but that is against the mores of my country. Why should I give up something valuable for this man? I am walking and I see a pond or large fountain. It is raining torrentially on the pond and on my van, which is parked by it with the doors open. I wonder if the interior of the van will be ruined, but somehow it's OK because this rain seems so special and intense and beautiful. I am enthralled by it. Another man comes up to me and wants me to walk in the rain with him, and join the line of people wading in the pond near the edge. I choose not to, even though it has a strong pull on me to abandon myself to the feeling. I go on and Kirk still follows. He wants to kiss me and is flirting and he's now in a cardboard box, a long narrow one, and I decide to give in to him. I pull him out of the box and into my arms and we kiss. I have risked all my values and respect. He then laughs and goes on. He is shallow and is no longer interested in me. I feel betrayed."

I hate being tickled and I squirm and yell, \"Stop it! Stop it!\" I am angry at him and he laughs and says, \"At least you can feel it.\" I say, \"No, that's not a good thing! It's worse than pain.\" Later, Charla and I go to a bar where I will perform. I go to find a place to sit and three women crowd around me. One is demanding to know what my disability is. She's very curious. I say, \"Wait a minute. Go sit there and I'll answer these other women's questions and then I'll answer yours.\" She goes and sits. Meanwhile a Blake-type person is flirting with me and I am pleased he's sitting near me, behind where I'm sitting. He had asked me some pathetic question about my disability and I had impressed him by saying I was the performer here. I answer the old woman's question. I advise her to get a medical dictionary and refer to it. She's not to happy with this general answer, but leaves. I need to go to the bathroom, so I go to find it, saying, \"I hope I don't find some sleazy guys here.\" I see a door and realize it's the men's room. I joke that I'd really find some sleazy ones there. I find the women's room and peek in. It's filthy. There are men in there too as well as women. I decide I'll wait and try to get back to my seat. The place is crummy and scary now and there is a boss that will try to cheat me. I just want to get out without getting Charla or myself hurt. The man, Blake, has moved and I feel sad, but realize he moved to get a better place to watch me. I decide to leave and go back where the man who pays me is, near the filthy restrooms. He counts out 57 dollars, a pathetic amount and an obvious cheat. To his surprise, I grin and say, \"Thank you.\" I'm just pretending to be happy so I can get out alive and then call the police and tell on them. I get out and Blake is there and he decides he needs to go to the bathroom. He gets in line and for reasons I don't recall, I decide to go back and go to the bathroom in the sleazy place. I get there and the man at the counter decides to return Charla and my things (coats and things). I am surprised. He tosses them to me one at a time. The last one is my jacket which has an American flag part sewn on the front right side (left as I look at it). I squeal and say, \"Oh, darn.\" He asks what the problem is. I look again and it is gone. I say, \"I thought I saw an American flag sewn on my jacket, but I was wrong.\""

I point to a small list, the first one on the page and say, \"...If you want to call an exec, you look him up on this page, but you wouldn't want an exec fixing your Chevy, so look up the mechanics.\" I see the name Chris D. and ask Jock's daughter if it is any relative to her. Then I say, \"Of course not, with the name D., your name is S.\" I have some errands to run and comment that I saw the interest rate at the bank was lower. He is hurt that I went to the bank and didn't even ask if he could go along. I say, \"Well, we can go tomorrow if you like.\" Then I look at my appointment book.

I go outside to see where the old man is. He is seated, resting in his back yard as a woman and a man are riding mowers and cutting the rich, full, green grass.

Beyond the yard is a dry and brown landscape, obviously without care or water, somewhat like M City. I notice the contrast between the lush yard and the surrounding landscape.

I pry her mouth open and find, instead of the horse chestnut things, a bunch of small plastic packages that sewing things come in. I pull them out saying, \"You could swallow these things and get sick. Don't put these in your mouth.\" I take them back to the porch where a box is that the sewing things belong in.

Picard and we have gone off together for a vacation. A woman (me) is cooking or stirring up a special dough. A stick like a wooden hair comb made of twigs is placed in the middle of the dough and the new ingredients can only be poured on the one side. It is an old tradition and is passed on from one to the other (generation, perhaps). He and I are going to have a wonderful time seeing the sunrise and set and swimming and loving."

I find some stuff between the door and the front seat, but it isn't all that appetizing. I notice a high wind coming and we run for an old dilapidated barn for cover. We get in and there is no way to close an old broken wooden window, no glass. We go to a corner and sit on a hay-strewn bench. I look out and see entire groves of trees being smashed by the force of the wind. Fortunately this is barren country and not much around to be destroyed. I try to feel good about cuddling up with this guy, but it is boring. There is nothing in the barn but us, the wooden bench and some bits of hay."

A white pipe is run up high on the wall and a huge tub is already installed. I say, \"This will be great, now that it's just the two of you, but what if one of you dies and then it will be too big for just one?\" I go into the kitchen. A woman and a man, both young, are passing a small feminine black hat back and forth to one another in a sort of ritualistic way. It is on a long white piece of crochet lace. I encourage them to do this ritual while they talk. The boy/man doesn't want to; he thinks it's silly. The young woman steps outside, perhaps she hears a noise. I follow. We are out in the wild fields now and I see some men, bad men, and they are trying to kill another man. Three of them have him down on his back and are choking him. I realize I am witnessing a murder. I say somewhat mildly, \"You had better let him go because there are witnesses now.\" They hesitate and then let go, but I am worried. They could kill me. I look at them closely so I can remember details to tell the police. I say, \"They are late 20's, early 30s. One man is in a white t-shirt and has a slight pot belly. They are very dangerous.\" They move away to regroup and the woman and I decide we'd better flee. Now we run and they chase and somehow I'm in an underground room with crates and boxes and we run and run. We climb a metal ladder thing attached to a wall and there are things from our car there and I'm trying to take these things with us but I must abandon them One rolls and drops, making a loud sound which gives us away and the men come running. We crawl up into a warehouse room and crawl into a cardboard box and hide. They are searching and are very close. It's almost like we are out in the open, pretending to be covered in the box and hoping they don't see us. As they talk, they seem to be moving closer and closer until it seems inevitable they would stumble on us, but they don't. One man crawls up high and swings across the room on a white rope thing. Now there is a tiny, bald-headed child, a child of one of the men, standing nearby staring at us. He/she sees us and we hold our breath, waiting to be told on. But she doesn't. The father of the child says to her, \"We have to go now, to find those women, but you have to stay here and you better be good.\" It seems cruel and abusive. They leave, going down the ladder we had come up on, shutting and locking the child in this room with us. Then the child comes directly to us and then shows us a huge grain or freight elevator. We get in and ride it down. We see my red car and run for it. The men are chasing us. We get in the car, I have the key and we drive (I drive like hell). They are in a car in hot pursuit. It's dark, the road/trail is dirt and skinny and curvy. I drive fast and furious. They're right on our tail. Then they are in front of us and headed right for us to crash or block us and I swerve and go up a steep embankment, up onto railroad tracks. Very clever, they think. They turn and pursue. Now we are driving down the tracks, hoping a train doesn't come at us and bushes on either side of the road so we couldn't exit if we wanted to. Now we are crossing a train trestle and yep, there's a train coming. We get off the trestle at the other end and down a steep embankment just at the last second and the men don't. They crash in flames. We stop running. Now we are out of the car in the bushes and I see flames, a wild fire. I say to the man, \"Let's get going.\" He says we should stay. I ask, \"Why? The fire is coming it will come here and we'll burn.\" He says, \"We must stay here.\" I want to leave, but I don't want to abandon him. I say, \"What if it does come here?\" He says, \"It won't if this is kept mowed down and the fire will not come here to us.\" It's coming, I can see it. Now I feel real fear because the men are dead and spirits now and that makes them more dangerous. They have stronger powers and are invisible. I want out of there. I say, \"What if it comes anyway?\" He says, \"It's OK, I have poison. I can give you some and we'll die.\" Just then a woman with dark hair, with mime white face and in a white linen business tailored suit, walks elegantly with a dead pan face toward us. Her face is long and angular. I am afraid!!"

A young, dark-haired woman comes up to him. He's in the pickup getting ready to drive on to the next place. She has a paper to be autographed and asks to come along. He pulls out a dictionary to look up the words to say to explain the rules to her, like she speaks a different language. He explains, pointing to the words in a dictionary. She smiles and speaks plain English, agreeing with the rules. She'll do anything to be able to be with them for a while. Now the other man, more flambuoyant, isn't there and the one man is driving and I'm in the passenger side, talking to him, still interviewing. But now the man asks me quietly and with feeling what I'm really doing here. Why do I go around interviewing people? I say, \"Searching, trying to find someone who is truly unique.\" I say, \"I can't find anyone because they might have unique qualities on the psychological level, like different life experiences and different parental values etc., but deep down, we are all the same. No one is unique.\" I smile at him and say, \"You can imagine how intrigued I was by you,\" and I curl around him, in a hug. He thinks, as I lay my hand down near his lap, that I am about to perform manual sex and starts to automatically get ready to receive it, but then he realizes I am just hugging and cuddling and nervously asks if I want ___ a drug like cocaine. I smile and say no. I say, \"I thought you were the one, but, no. I see you are not. You are the same as everyone.\" He smiles in recognition, sadly. \"You can imagine how thrilled I am to hear this,\" he says. I smile. He gently places his hands over my breasts, on top of my shirt. It's a sexy gesture because you would expect him to try to fondle the breasts to get me excited, but he doesn't, he just gently pats me there. I put my hands over his in a touching gesture, and pat his hands. It's sweet, poignant and sexy. I feel a sensual pleasure. This is impossible and we both know it. I see the dirt mountainous road we are on, off in the wilderness alone. It narrows and I see ahead of us a brick wall, like a fireplace in a living room and bushes in the road. We slow down and stop. We neither of us move, because it would break the magic spell. I want us to continue getting closer. The moment freeze-frames and I wake up, feeling sweet and sad, and wanting something."

I pass the orchestra and see a large carnival ride-like thing that swoops up and down and under it is a large water pond. There is a green alligator and wild cats that eat things. I think of going on the game and decide not to, those cats look vicious. I return the way I came and see a beautiful cello on the ground. I look more closely and ask the oriental man if that is a cello. He says, \"Yes.\" I say, \"It looked for a moment like a dulcimer, the color or type of wood, but I did think it was a cello.\" He smiles and then admires my skirt. It is a cotton wrap-around with designs and pictures that represent the history of Mexico. He is intrigued and bends down to look closely at the hem area. Suddenly, he rips off a section of the skirt and takes it. I am angry and say, \"Wait, you made a hole.\" He ignores me. I walk on, trying to decide what to do. I decide I'll go find a policeman and return to get that piece of my skirt from him. I look at the ramp on the right, thinking of going back that way, but it looks too long and I'd get tired. So I go back the way I came up to the original level. I see Nate and feel sad and wistful. His wife is nearby and I think she may be the owner of this mansion. He stands close to me and we chit chat, but we look at each other with longing. She stops by and chats and walks out the door. Nate is going with her and he pauses to say goodbye like to an acquaintance, but we stand close and I brush my hand over his just to touch. It is a tender, secretive moment. He goes out. I turn to rejoin the party. Now I want to go home, to the old M City house, but first the woman of the house (sort of Nate's wife) says, \"Why don't you take this carpet, for Charla.\" I agree and together we roll it up and she hands me pieces of tape and I wrap it around and around to secure the roll of carpet. Then Nate comes up and smiles gently and says, \"Why don't I help carry that for you.\" I know this means he'll come in and we'll be lovers again. I want to resist, sort of, but I don't. The woman steps away and Nate says, \"First, put this rose in my hair.\" He kneels like some ritual thing and I pluck a white rose or two from the table decoration and stand behind him to place the roses in the ponytail of long brown hair. It is touching and tender, and a ritual. I pat his head, maybe kissing it lightly. He says, \"Move the family thing.\" I look to the table and see a big plate of food on a holder warmer dish and realize he means to move the plate so he can put the carpet roll on it for a moment before he heaves it on his shoulder, and we walk down the road to the M City house and some alone time for ourselves to make love.

A man I like comes in and sees me walking. He's so happy, he and I hug, standing up and kiss and now it's like we have declared our love to each other. We are interrupted with the news that I am going to be the dance queen tonight, like homecoming queen for the prom or something. This is going to be a long night and I wonder if I will be able to manage being so active on my feet so much. I have to dance with every man. The older man who runs the place insists I walk across the gym and stand at the edge of the bathtub and then walk all the way across the gym to where a long table is. I protest this will hurt me too much, but he insists. I do it and the young men line up one at a time to dance with me. They each bring a card with some phrases written on them, like cards you get with flowers. A young man announces each one. One man and I dance. Then I have to walk back to the bath tub area. This goes on for awhile and I want my loved one to come dance with me before it's too late and I can't move. Again I'm at the table and I just refuse to do the long walk. I go straight out to the dance floor. The older man is angry and insists I do it the \"right\" way. I mouth the words \"fuck off\" and go back to the table. The announcing man says, \"Did I hear swear words?\" I say, \"You didn't HEAR them!\" Then the music is wild and Latin and I start dancing toward the center of the floor all by myself. A woman comes up to me and says, \"This will be terrible.\" I ask, \"What will?\" She says, \"You're older than us and you'll end up living here and then you'll be 85 years old and our children will see you and be afraid.\" I say, \"You mean like I'll be the old witch of the village?\" She says, \"Yes.\" This upsets her. I'm a little annoyed myself at her. I see a man dancing across the floor and he's wonderful at it. He's dark and Latin. I dance to him and it's so graceful, like we're skating only we're in stocking feet (nylons for me). We glide and swirl around and now his girlfriend is jealous and tries to cut in. The three of us do a kind of duck and pull dance. Then I glide out of it and they go off. The older man has shoved the big bathtub over to the center so I can still do the ritual, but not walk so far. I smile at his tenacity. He glares at me because he had to compromise. I go stand in front of the tub. There is lots of steaming warm water in it and I feel my aching, limping joints start to feel better by standing in the warm steam. Behind the tub is a young man, seated. He has a bright tow head blonde crew cut. He makes a smart remark and I grab him by the hair and pull him to standing like he's a naughty little boy. He grimaces. Now I hear my love. He's drunk and he's coming to the dance to start a food fight with catsup and mustard to break up the dance so I can get away and off my feet. It's a rescue. I catch his eye and he looks at me lovingly but drunk. He's wearing black pants. Some of the young women come up to me to help me get out before the fight gets going good. I say, \"Wait, my cards and gifts. I want them.\" Someone goes to collect them for me and we go out. I am relieved I can soon sit down and not hurt so much, and sad I never got a dance with my love."

I take her by the hand, and we walk back down the long hall with up and down stairs in it toward the front rooms where I live. She says, \"How come I haven't been here very much? It's important to be here.\" I say, \"I don't know, but now you will live here.\" I feel badly I've neglected her."

The house is big, with lots of long tables end to end down some long hall. I am walking and enjoying it. Rochelle and another woman in a wheelchair comes. I look at Rochelle's new wig, brown and kind of ugly looking. I compliment her and say it's pretty. She smiles and they go sit and wait as I am busy with greetings. I see uncles and cousins and then my Grandmother Agnes. I am very happy to see her and hug her a long hard time. \"I'm so glad to see you again,\" I say. She says, \"Do you remember Sandy?\" I think her son. I laugh and say, \"Oh yes, when we were children, I was called Sandy and I named him that.\" I go on and finally find a place at the far end of this endless feast. We get turkey and potatoes and there is plenty, but I realize we didn't get the special treats, the cranberry sauce, the salads and biscuits and so on, so I say to a woman down the table, \"Could you ask the captain (of an airplane) to pass down the sauce?\" She's embarrassed to do it. I ask the co-pilot to do it. He hesitates and I get annoyed and say, \"Oh, for goodness sakes, I guess I'll just do it myself!!\" I get up, which shames the woman, who tries to ask the Capt., who ignores the request. I walk passed him and find salads and jellos and biscuits and cake and lots of cream cheese special dishes and start gathering them up; apple butter, applesauce. I see co-worker Gordon and clap him happily on the shoulder and say, \"I must have sat at the wrong end of the table. We didn't get all this.\" He smiles and we joke about how I'm just a complainer. A woman who is gathering up the leftovers says, \"What are you going to do with all this?\" I say, \"Don't worry, it won't go to waste. I'll take it to the babies in the hospital, maybe to the homeless.\""

I am basically inquiring if he would be receptive to this sort of thing. He squirms and says something about already having a girlfriend. I guess I'm too old for him. My feelings are not hurt; I simply asked. He's free to respond anyway he wishes. I look over to a young woman in front of him and ask with my eyes about the kiss, but we both pass on it. Now Katrina is explaining the trick, which involves 25 round, tiny disks in a pile. The son has a Bic lighter and has trouble lighting it. It clicks and clicks.

I exclaim at one, \"Oh, it's dead, I think,\" and wonder if it got water, if it would still grow new shoots. I find some necklaces and ask if anyone knew who's they were. A woman claims them. I was kind of hoping no one would so I could have them, they were pretty. Now I'm putting piles of papers and things in boxes and going to take them home and sort them. Rochelle is seated on a couch and a woman in a wheelchair comes to the door. I am standing between them. They are role-playing talking to each other on a phone and I am coaching them. I teasingly say to the one behind the half-open door, \"Now remember, you're calling your girlfriend.\" I feel good about being so open and friendly about her lesbianism. After they exchange a few sentences, the role play is over and Rochelle is blushing and has bright red lipstick on. She says that is hard. I agree and say, \"Communication is an art form; it is hard,\" and encourage her to continue trying. I go on packing. I step outside and see buses arriving. Big bands are arriving for a musical evening which I'm not staying for because it will be too crowded and uncomfortable. I see a marimba band bus and think, \"Maybe I will stay, after all some really good music will be here,\" but still I know I won't stay. A couple of the musicians call out to me for directions to the play they will play, and I ignore them, shy and not wanting to connect with them, although there is a part of me that is like a fan and wants to connect. I am sort of regretting doing this even as I continue doing it. I go back inside and think, \"Maybe I'll stay.\" I go out to the backyard where it will be held and try to imagine it full of 2,000 people. I would have to go into the woods and pee because I'd never get through all those people to get back inside, especially in my wheelchair. I then drive my chair down a wooded path where no one is, using a small flashlight attached to my wheelchair and squat and pee. I am wearing my swirly multi-colored skirt of Uni house days. I return and go inside. No, I won't stay. I gather up some boxes, I see a t-shirt, black with a picture of me as a cheerleader in my French beret hat. I see an old wrinkled red head resident hat of Uni house, etc. I go ask a couple of young men to help me carry these boxes out."

I wonder she isn't ripping out the underbelly of her craft with this plowing-through attitude she's got. Finally she sees the center channel, which is the Mississippi River, and deep and large. She goes there and it's clear sailing for a while. Then there is a decision point. On the left is a huge inland lake and to the right, over a sand bar, is more river. She is very impressed with this lake. It is exciting, so huge, the largest lake bounded by a continent. It seems too much for her and she decides to go on down the river, but then now the boat is being driven down a sand dune to the ocean, where an edge of the lake connects. I realize with delight she could not resist the lake and is going for it in a round about way. Now we're on the ocean and I can feel her (the ocean's) powerful waves."

I see potato peelers and I open one drawer and see it is a mini stove, a sort of built in hot plate thing. I think that's neat. I see tiny coke bottles and gather them up to throw them out. I think they are cute. I decide to keep this table. I pick up cards off the other table that were laid out all in a row. I open a door and see it goes to more rooms, an old room with bits of leftover furniture stored, chairs, etc. I open another door and see a flight of stairs that go down to a basement and a flight of stairs that goes right back up the other side. I try to look around the corner at the bottom to where the basement room goes to the right, but don't want to go down there. I shut the door hurriedly, kind of scared. I then decide to throw the trash down a flight of stairs to the garbage can. Then I decide to go down there and look around. I see I own a motorcycle. I go down and practice riding it, around and around slowly in a circle on the blacktop of my driveway. A neighbor man watches, interested. I see I have a shop front glass window at the ground level and peek in. Perhaps it was an art store. There are lots of windows that let in light in this house. Now I am ready to go for a morning ride on the motorcycle to take picture. I notice I am near a river. I go down the path. Then I see some tree stumps hanging out near the path, dead logs really, laying down. I stop to take pictures of them. I am very artistically intent. The man follows, watching, pleased with me. I see a bright blotch of golden sunlight diffused with ducks flying up and I swing around and snap pictures. There will be beautiful pictures. I go on, more confident with my driving ability. I get to the small coastal town I now live in. I wander around looking at the shops."

I sit in the chair and feel what it's like to push it with my hands, a sports chair. I am going across a bridge, a long one over a huge river and it is now a boat. And as I move down the sidewalk, it is going up and down in the waves. I hang onto the grid metal grating very hard. Each wave brings me down closer to the water. I back up a bit, and the next wave gets me closer to the water. Finally, I am over my head and under water. I hold my breath. Finally, we reach land. I get off and go find a place to stay. I share a tiny apartment with some other people. There are no bathtub or shower facilities there. I'll have to shower at school. I am annoyed at my roommates. One is a stupid young innocent college age girl who follows around the big, handsome, self-centered young man, who is quite willing to take advantage of her and make love to her and then dump her. I am angry at them both. I go into a tiny bathroom and pee. It is 1 o'clock in the morning and I need sleep because tomorrow is the first day of school. Then I wake up and we immediately head on out, looking for a bus. I see a street, N. 4th. It's a city like Dover. We go to the street. Someone says, \"Go to the right, there's a mall.\" But I look to the left and see a bus station stop. I go in that direction as I hear one of my roommates whine he was hungry and would have wanted to get something to eat while he waited for the bus. I pass a popcorn stand and think, he can eat that. Now I am balancing, walking, on a curb of a skinny sidewalk. I feel kind of proud I can do this balancing act. Nobody particularly notices. I get to the bus stop and see two oddly dressed people miming and holding out brochures. I joke with my roommate out loud, teasing the people. I say, \"Oh, look, here are some strange people that want our attention. I'm going to ignore them.\" They shrug and we pass. Then I realize they are the people with the bus route information and say, \"Oh look, they had what I wanted and I walked right by.\" I go back and get a bus route book off a counter. I see a woman in a wheelchair and she works for the bus. I ask the way to the college. She says, \"There's a map over here. I see it but it is really high up for a person in a wheelchair to see well. I notice I have a bunch of file folders I don't need, old booklets of the disability unit at the community college, Xmas craft project instructions, a satin angel ornament. etc. I try to sort them out, and only take the stuff I need for college today. I now have a huge bag of yarn and a half knitted thing on double point needles. The woman says, \"Is this yours?\" I say, \"It wasn't, but I guess I'll take it.\" Then the woman points out a fat woman in an old manual chair in line for the bus. She says, \"Too bad, that one really smells\" (hasn't taken a bath for a while). She'll probably take the seat on the bus and I'll have to wait for another one. I look at my watch. It's noon. I still have time, but I am feeling frustrated and concerned and burdened down with all this stuff I'm carrying. I wonder if there is a locker there nearby where I can store some of this until I get back from class."

Maybe I'll find something here, where it's not so crowded. I find a yarn department and see the prices are really good. A knitting needle that costs $1.25 is a $1 off. I think of stocking up.

Then I see a sort of scene where the daddy comes home and the child is delighted to have him there because it's someone else to play with and relate to.

I take her in my lap, remembering how it felt to hold my girls when they were little, like 2 or 3 years old. I pat her on the butt and leg gently as a way to comfort her.

They are so big they don't see us waving or hear us yelling for help. A boat goes by towing like a water skier, a car. I think that is strange. Now I am dumped out of our boat and am struggling to stay afloat. I am in front of a boat and I wave. Finally they see us and rescue us. Now the boat is a truck and my office supplies are in it, including my manila envelopes I send scripts in. Someone, a female, perhaps Millie, is moving the things into the house. I reluctantly agree they should be there, but I don't want them to clutter up the place. Now we have to move where I keep my things. I have an ironing board with cubby holes under it where I am putting some of the envelopes. Another library table is against the wall. I pace. Howard is in the house. I open the window and look out. I lean out. I want out. I take in the fresh air. Now I go to the other end of the room and lean out another window. It is a full floor up from another room in the house. Nothing is in the room. I realize as I'm leaning that I am laying on a sliding drawer that is going full out and suddenly it slides right out and the drawer and I are falling the full floor down. I hope I won't get hurt. I land and it is painful but I am OK. I am shocked I did that. I realize it was partially suicide. Howard comes into the room and I tell him what just happened. He does not even acknowledge he heard. He turns and walks back into the room he was in. I follow him, screaming, \"I hate that. I hate it when you don't respond!\" He ignores me. I go back upstairs to my room and notice the drawer is gone on that window so I can't do it again. I pace, upset. Howard is moving me out."

I go to the front door to greet the guests. They are all high-powered lawyer type men. They come in. I flirt strongly with one of them. An older man doesn't think I'm a good wife. He comments. I walk purposefully across the room, grab him by his suit lapels and stick my face in his. I say very firmly, if not menacingly, \"I have a Ph.D., I have an IQ of ___ (very high), I'm a damn good lawyer and so why shouldn't I be what I am. My husband understands this and gets out of my way\" (meaning it is a good balanced relationship). Even so, I still deliberately go after this other man with the intent of having sex with him. We dive into a swim pool, fully dressed in our party clothes. He and I are in a far corner talking and he starts to get pushy and rough. I realize I'm in \"over my head\" and have made a wrong decision. My husband is truly a nice man and why am I messing with this other guy? I swim away from him to return to my husband."

Dovre takes my crutches and goes around deliberately falling down in front of people so they will rush to her thinking she is a crippled girl and pick her up. I am embarrassed that she would do this. I watch her do it; she's in a dress and she falls. The people rush over, all in sympathy. Dovre is grinning and playing it up. I shrug and think, \"Well, if that's what she wants to do, but I'd never do that. I can't believe she would do it.\" Then suddenly the boat starts rolling down the steep hill. I hang on and say to Howard, \"What's happening?\" He says, \"I don't know.\" He peeks over the edge of the boat and looks at the wheels. I say, \"This thing is running away. This could be dangerous.\" He starts to get out to pull it to a stop. I lean this way and that to give it direction, to steer it. I do it well and he pulls it and I turn it so that it must go uphill, which finally brings it to a stop. I say to Howard, \"I did that. Didn't I do that well? I think I did that well.\" He says, \"Oh yeah, that was OK.\" I really want him to compliment me. He's his usual noncommittal self. Now we start pushing it back up the hill. I am still in it and I ask him if he wants me to get out so it won't be so heavy to push. As he is deciding if he wants me to get out, another woman gets in, expecting a ride up the hill. I say, \"Hey, we have to get out. I'm getting out too.\" She says, \"Well, if you're getting out, then I suppose so.\" She is reluctant to move. I get out and now I am climbing up a narrow shaft of stairs. I know this is hard to do and I am thankful the shaft is so narrow that I can lean my back against the wall of one side as I walk up the stairs, or I would fall, it is so steep. I place one hand on the next step up and pull myself up one step at a time. Finally I find the top. I can't pull myself up the last step and I call out for help. \"Help, help,\" I call. People laugh and refuse to help me. \"I have trouble walking,\" I say. They sneer. I finally manage to pull myself up and I stand, brushing away the dust on my knees. I see an open room, a sort of classroom where people are seated and I say to them, \"That's one more karma for you.\" They sneer and laugh at me. I walk on, trying to get back to where we'd started. I see a poster on the ground. It says Andrea and Mel Torme. I think I'm in a Mexican village."

They have put up pictures on the wall and knick knacks and it's like a tiny, crowded living room. Their regular living quarters are a long way back down this hall. I guess they needed extra storage space. I look at the pictures. I see one and pick it up off the sort of \"plate holder\" contraption holding it up. I then see the holder is a series of figurines my mother had made years ago. One is the wicked witch of the west, out of clay like her little pilgrims she made. I see it is her face on the little figure. I laugh. I show it to my cousins. My father is there. I ask when was it we went to Disneyland. She says the first time was years ago, I'd just had one of the babies and I wanted to go, but I was in a lot of pain and they didn't want to release me from the hospital. I said, \"Really? I thought we only went once when I was in high school.\" She says, \"No, after the babies, we went.\" I say, \"After the girls, huh?\" Then I remember there was me and then two boys and then Lydia. I say, \"What did you do?\" She says I told her (the nurse) I always fight for who I am. My father said, in response to my repeated question, what did you do? that \"She nursed her,\" meaning the nurse nursed her to ease the pain (meaning somehow removing milk from breasts). Now I go into a tiny room next to this tiny room, which is Dovre's bedroom. I am looking at the shelves of boxing gloves and things like that she has. She's in the armed services. Three men from her unit come in. One is a black man. He says to her -- my back is to him as I'm looking at all this sports equipment -- he says, \"I'd like to talk to you, Fever, alone, in private.\" I say, \"Well, then I'd best give you some space to be private, FEVER.\" They step out of the room, expecting Dovre to follow. I say, \"No, I'll step out, it's your room after all.\" I go out. I tell my parents of the incident, only this time my mother is white and my father is black. Or maybe they are Dovre's parents. They look worried like maybe she'll choose a black husband, because that's what she had as a father (Dovre looked completely white.) Now we've moved on somewhere, and are walking. A woman is standing by the path, gesturing to us to look. Dovre says in awe, \"She's dripping in gold.\" She has a number of gold chain necklaces on she is trying to sell. This completely fascinated Dovre. I feel her being drawn away to this. I am worried. Now it's sort of cowboy days. The black men come back and harass us. He says, \"Go ahead, hit me.\" I say, \"No, I won't because that's what you expect.\" Now he's grabbed me and holding me close to him belligerently. My knee is right up against his balls. He says, \"Go ahead, kick me in the balls.\" I'm tempted but say, \"No, that's what you expect.\" I then push him down on the ground somehow and say, \"But I will eat your face off,\" and begin to bite him ferociously. This surprises him and it hurts him and (I think I got him down by stepping on his foot hard with stiletto heels). Now he's not protecting his balls so I knee him there. Just as I thought, he had a plastic protector on. He laughs and says, \"See, no balls.\" I say, \"I knew that.\""

I do this several times, really mystified as to why I can't see them.

I make a comment that I've had some dreams that are pertinent to the material we are reading and would like some help working them. The group calls on the writer of the material to come and work with us and my dreams specifically. He comes. It is Jeremy. He sits on the bench several people to my right and I realize that he has made a special trip over just to work on my material just because I requested it.

Someone mistakes me for a Master's student and says, \"Come on, you're next.\" On a whim, I decide to try it. I wear green and yellow sweats (UO colors) and brush my hair up into a weird male pompadour hairdo. I go in, and up on stage. I bang away on chairs, drums, walls, anything around and the rhythm is quite good. I hope they don't ask me any theory questions; I wouldn't know them. I think about what a 16th note would be like. The audience loves me. They think I'm a guy and they cheer wildly for me. They are far back in the auditorium. I walk down a side ramp or stairs toward the front of the stage. I see the head of a professor, but not his body. I guess the body is behind a wooden door, partition, at the front of the stage. I am a bit arrogant. Later, I wake up and then fall back into this dream. Only this time, we are in the next morning and we have to have our pictures taken. I am wearing a sexy black strapless dress that curls provocatively over my full breasts. I look down and notice my nipples are showing and try to readjust the dress. I head for the bathroom and some woman says, \"Don't forget, don't eat or drink anything before the pictures\" (like a nurse would say before a test of some kind). I say, \"But I can go pee, right?\" She agrees. I go in and try to pee, but can't. A woman opens the door and closes it. I get up and go out, headed for the stage area. I want to hurry and get the picture over with so I can change into my drummer suit (male) and play. I again notice my nipples are showing and readjust. I think, \"Maybe I should change now. It wouldn't do for my mother to see me dressed like this.\" I joke, \"Maybe I should hold my hands like this,\" over the breasts to cover them; it looks silly. The woman comedian from the community college is there and saying she just can't do this. She's going to give up and not do a picture. I shrug, a quitter. Oh well, it's her choice."

I sense someone coming into the room and laying down on the bed with me. I wonder who it is and then as that person readjusts their position, I roll back into them so that we are now in spoon fashion. I know this person is a woman and wonder if it is Dora or Ellie. I feel a bit uncomfortable about it and then decide to just relax and not worry about it. What will happen will happen. She leans into me and sweetly caresses my hair and kisses me once on top my head like someone would do for a baby or a dear friend. I do not respond, but feel loved. She gets up and leaves. I sit up and look out the window and see a cafe outside and wonder what it serves to eat. It could be fun eating in a place so conveniently near home. I see bears, like Russian circus bears, and call to my daughter to come look. Now I go outside to see the bears. One comes near and rolls over as though it wanted its tummy rubbed. A woman goes over to do that. I warn her to be careful, these are bears and could still be dangerous. She rubs her scruffy, fuzzy, slippered foot on the bear, who rolls back over and growls and starts to bite her foot. She backs off, afraid. I go to distract the bear by making noises. I am aware I do not want to put myself in danger just to save her. A man passes by and pushes the bear and it goes off and away. I notice we are on a beach and the ocean looks inviting. My girls want me to be in the boat with them, and as I am trying to climb up the side of the boat to get in, they speed it up and head for deeper waters. At first it is playful and then more serious. I say over and over, \"Please wait until I get in.\" This could get dangerous. Finally I am in. They are sort of surfing with the boat. We'd go up a wave and surf down the curl. It is scary and I don't want to do it, but as it repeats, I start to get used to it and enjoy it. Then I see we're still in the bay or protected water. I look over and see the real ocean, dirty with oil drilling crews and huge, hard waves. The girls want to boat in it and I decline, saying, \"They are working here. We'd only get in the way.\" So we go on down the shoreline and then the water gets deeper and a wave comes up to my waist. I am clothed and all wet. I look behind me and see it's big waves coming. I look ahead, on down the shoreline, and see we're being funneled into a slooshing thing which could get dangerous very fast. I try to find handholds on the now high bank we are near. I wonder when the open beach became this wall of dirt and tree roots. I find a way up and call out to them. They announce they also found ways up. I crawl up, ripping out rotten boards to reveal a roadway up there I could get to. I pull and struggle to get up there because the waterway is getting very scary and dangerous."

My two accomplices are off somewhere doing their part of the robbery. I then go off somewhere and put on a disguise. I am aware of how close the trigger is to being pulled. I worry I'll accidentally pull it and hurt somebody. The trigger is warped or melted in an odd shape. I see one of my accomplices and ask what I'm supposed to be doing. He says, \"Get the wire cutters and cut the fence.\" I say, \"Near the van?\" He says, \"Yes.\" I go there, realizing the disguise is working.

I get angry and righteous and say, \"To hell with you then.\" The teacher glares at me and says, \"ou can't come back in here because you were a part of the men's mischievous disruptions of class.\" I say to him, \"To hell with you. I simply left the room to go to the bathroom at the same time they all left.\" He said, \"You were gone one hour. I say, \"I had a little problem, OK??\" I am belligerent, and sassy, \"and furthermore, you are boring and don't know much. If you want me to stay in the dream interpretation class, you better get good.\" I go to the table where the men students are seated and it's away across the huge room. A paper comes down for me to sign, the roll call. The men all signed in funny markings to confuse the teacher. I sign my name \"Sanders\" dead center in blue ink, trying to be legitimate."

The wall is covered with a blue foam pad-like substance to prevent nicks and so on. The woman bumps it and causes a big hole and wrinkles it up. Now the landlords are going to be upset. The woman trowels some putty stuff into the hole and tries to straighten up the wall. I go through the door, which is glass and wood frame, to the kitchen area. We have some glasses and that's about it. I come back to the living room and shut the door, pulling a chain to shut it. Then I look out the window, which is small and a bit high up. I see we are on the shore of a huge body of water. The waves are big and choppy. I see lots of high-rise apartment buildings along the shore. It's not all that pretty. As I watch the waves, a huge one comes up and splashes on the window. I am surprised. Another one does so. \"Hey, we need to move,\" I say. The woman doesn't agree, \"We just got here, and our furniture isn't here and it will be fine.\" I am adamant. I cry out, startled. She says, \"What?\" I say, \"Never mind.\" I thought I saw a huge wave, but it was just a big building across the way. Another wave hits. Water splashes inside a bit. \"This will ruin everything inside,\" I say. We have to move. So we do. She is reluctant. I am now traveling down a skinny, curvy road toward the town in a van or VW bus. On one curve we are going too fast and we nearly run off the embankment and crash, but we don't. I scream for a second and then calm down. I hope the next car in our caravan doesn't crash on that corner."

I put a tea bag in a glass of boiling water and let it steep a long time. The other women come in and offer to help me. I refuse their help because I am doing fine. I go into another room and there is a baby. I touch her hair and it's coarse and nappy. Someone says, \"That's an Asian baby,\" and I say, \"No, black.\" I then look and see she has Asian slant eyes. I amend my opinion and think she is Asian with an American soldier black father. I like the baby and play with her and pat her hair. Now Dwight comes to me and says he's drunk, so he won't help drive home tonight. I realize that means it's my father and me and I feel tired. I feel a bit resentful, but I'm also glad he was up front about his condition. Dwight then says, \"I was supposed to go over to Sonja's house and look at the stairs, to see if I can fix them, but they aren't home. Should I go in anyway?\" He is hesitant. I go out and look over to her house. Aunt Esther comes over and says, \"Go ahead, go on in.\" I open a door and go from room to room, very pleased with what I see. Each room is unusual in shape and design. There is hardly any furniture, like the 1950's abstract shapes. There are long, curved rooms with panels of breezy curtains. I see a door with a number on it like this was once an office building. I hesitate and Esther says, \"Go on in.\" I open the double doors (like hotel suite connecting doors) and step into an empty veranda room where the opposite wall is missing, and a huge, warm ocean is there, lapping up to the level of the floor. I gasp and say, \"I would kill to have a room like this.\" I go look at the ocean, trying to see if it is deep or shallow. I see some rocks on the bottom and Lydia goes out wading. It is like bath water. I envy her spontaneity. I don't step in, feeling a bit leery of deep places. I see there are no insects here and think that probably if it were my room, there sure would be and imagine a swarm of black flying insects. I open another door and see a huge bathtub with water in it, and a baby's tub sitting in it. It is like the adult and the baby bath are together in their own luxurious tub. I walk on down the hall and see a kitchen area where there are restaurant type sinks all over the place with water in them, and look for the dining tables. At first I think, \"How convenient because the sink would be near the table and you wouldn't even have to get up to wash the dishes.\" Then, I see the dining table is in another room. Bummer, how inconvenient."

I grumble but go out and try to sit on a bench and a woman suggests we go on to another room. I do, but think maybe we'll get left behind in the backwash in this room. I lay down on a bench and the man comes in to lead the discussion. He asks some questions. I answer a question and a man says, \"But that's discriminatory,\" as an answer to the question. \"Say more so I understand,\" I say because I didn't answer that it was discriminatory to the disabled. He repeats the question. \"If a package of benefits were announced as available to the disabled, would that be discriminatory?\" I say, \"No, it wouldn't because if you had said you are disabled, go get the packet, it would be, but because it is offered in general and a person chooses if they consider themselves disabled, it isn't.\" The man agrees, I was right. I sigh relief. It would be embarrassing if I hadn't got it right, after all. The second question is about counseling. I raise my hand and say, \"That will be easy, I'm a counselor.\" Another woman on another bench says she is too. Then I need to go across town on the lunch break and get something. I get in a small sports car convertible and am driving. I change into the left lane and notice the cars on the left side traffic take the middle construction lane. \"Remember that,\" I warn myself. I am in S City and feel lost. I say, \"This is a small town, I'll learn where things are soon enough.\" Now a man in a motorcycle is on my right and says, \"Got any tunes??\" I say no, even though I have a car radio. \"Why not try this station?\" I say, \"I'm new here and don't know the stations. I don't know which one is jazz and so on.\" I look ahead and see a railroad warning light going and decide to not stop. We are crossing the tracks when I see the train coming suddenly from a blind area on the right, and I slam on my brakes and turn around, practically dragging my car by picking it up around me and walking back. I realize I'd made a wrong decision that could have cost me my life. I am chagrined. \"I won't do that again,\" I say. I park and the man is still on my right, trying to convince me I'd feel better if I turned on the tunes. He says, \"I'll show you,\" and plays a Pat Benatar (or Boone song). I am annoyed with him for pressing it. I know music makes you feel good, I just don't want to do it right now, because he's so insistent."

He goes back to the living room and is talking to a man when I get up, in panties and a blouse and take off my bra as I walk into the room where he is, now all hot to trot myself. I wave the bra seductively and he grins and excuses himself and we go to my room and make passionate love, to create a baby. It must be done right at that moment. The position is strange, but feels quite normal in the dream. He's laying on his tummy and I sit on his butt. I see the bald spot on the back of his head and kiss it tenderly. Later, we have children and live in this house with many rooms. I see a bedroom where the walls and floor are scuffed and wood chips flaking up and needs to be cleaned up, a dressing room with a curved wall mirror is between two guest bedrooms. In the living room down the hall is a huge gold couch with many sections. I walk in and grin at him, because it is time to make love to have another baby. He gets up and shoos the kids away. He puts an audio tape cassette up my vagina we are in a hurry because we are driven to do it at this very moment in order to get pregnant. We make love; it is great."

I look in to find someone to ask. I see a woman in a manual chair in there and I notice the gym floor is slanted on a hill. I wonder how one can play on such a surface. I put on ski-like things and sort of skate with them. Ginny rolls down the incline and I skate after her, hitting her accidentally. I apologize. I then learn how to move on these ski things and practice. I do fairly well. Then I decide I must go to the bathroom. I go down the hall. I enter a room. I see Blake and say hi. I had gone into the gym and not tried to find the pre-appointed meeting area for the dream group. In my search for the restroom, I see where the meeting room is. Blake is in uniform, like the army, only I know it's more like a sweat suit for the games. He kind of ignores me. I go back out to the hall. He comes out and says hello. I like seeing him again. We feel shy. His wife comes into the hall, talking a mile a minute. She has two white plastic dessert dishes in her hand. I look at the desserts. They are all pink with a rosette on one. I say, \"That's the prettiest dessert I've ever seen.\" Blake wants to see what I'd call the prettiest. He looks, but she's already eaten the rosette, so it doesn't look like much. She's talking on like a wife of many years and I feel a bit uncomfortable with the edge I hear in their relationship. I tell them about a dream I had about Jeramy. I say I was in the gym and I looked up and there was Jeramy flying around in the air, and behind him on the wall is a huge, golden, metal, round cherub face with sun rays coming out of it, of Jeramy. I tell them I interpreted this to be about spirituality. Then I see a crow circling near Jeramy, and I laughed with delight to see the dream adding the flesh and the blood of this world. Wasn't that a wonderful dream? Blake agrees. I ask if he took notes at the Jeramy workshop because I wasn't there. He said yes. I am sitting on the table in the hall, and out of the gym comes one of the charismatic leaders of the workshop. I greet him joyfully and get up to hug him. As we are hugging, I realize he is a real man and is attracted to me. I let go of him and sit down again. He says something about his 46-year-old son and I realize he's as old as my father. Then Jeramy comes out and I get up and go hug him, happy to see him. He is also happy to see me. I repeat to him the telling of the \"Jeramy dream,\" and as I do, I pause and say, \"I was interpreting the dream while I was dreaming. I do that more and more these days.\" He enjoys hearing the dream. He says, \"Did you read,\" and he says an authors name and I say, \"I don't remember.\" He says it's about the masculine as psychopath, the coyote. \"Oh yes, I remember reading that. As a matter of fact, I read that near the time of the workshop where you weren't teaching it, I was having panic attacks.\" Jeramy and I move back to the table where Blake is. Jeramy says, \"I hope you don't mind, but Blake has told me about you and him, and you two are made for each other. What happened?\" I stare down at the table I'm leaning, sitting on and fiddle with straightening two pieces of paper. I think, \"I don't really know.\" I say and think some more."

Some women laugh and then they sit quietly, moved by the emotions of the play. I feel a moment of concern that my intimate thoughts are being made public, but then feel OK about it. I try to get closer to see the audience. I step in the curtains and watch the actress doing a scene. She is swinging out on a trapeze bar-like swing out over the audience and back. I remember the actress said she's done this before. I am concerned she'll hurt herself or fall. A small girl is on a swing in the background depicting the childhood memory. There are voices of children teasing, male voices. The actress gets off the swing and almost gets caught up in the chains, but manages to free herself. Now it is near the end of the play I want to be closer to hear the response. I then somehow manage to go to the wrong audience, a group of uniformed men (army brown) watching a show that ends with a commercial selling things. They applaud thunderously. I realize I'm in the wrong place. I go to the next auditorium down the hall and see a huge concert hall and they are applauding thunderously. No, this isn't my play. I return, but it's too late. It's over. I \"count the house.\" Maybe 40 or 50 people saw it, including some uniformed Boy Scouts. I wonder if they understood the play or if it was too painful for them to see. Now I go out in to the hall and the actress (dark haired) comes out. I say, \"I wish this had been taped so I could see it. She says, \"Well, I did tape it, but who is going to pay for the tape, reimburse me?\" I say, \"Well, I will.\" I feel a bit put upon, but am trying to be reasonable. Then she says or does something and I say indignantly, \"Do not (either attack or hit or wallop) me.\" We glare at each other and she goes on to finish whatever she was doing."

I look out the windshield and see we are parked next to several TV crews vans. This will be a good vantage point. Now I wiggle around and am in the passenger side. The older man is saying, \"What is all this stuff?? There's no room for us.\" He looks into a sack. I say, \"You can put it back in the bed of the truck.\" He peeks in and it is a huge bag of pillow stuffing the receptionist gave to me. We can't put that back there, it'd get wet and ruined. Now the pickup is sliding forward. I say \"Hey, hey, we're rolling.\" The other man complains and leans on the brakes. We stop just short of hitting the car parked in front of us. The older man backs us up and over a bump to keep us there. We are parked on mud. \"We're rolling again,\" I say. The younger man complains and sluggishly steps on the brakes. Then someone notices it's very crowded around us and we'll only get to see the beginning and the end of the race. So the young man turns on the ignition and drives us out of there. \"Hey,\" I say, \"What are you doing? We'll lose our good spot (vantage point).\" He says, \"It's not worth it, I'll find another.\" I get angry and raise my voice and swear as I state quite clearly how unhappy I am. He made the decision without consulting us and it's not fair. The older man takes off his glasses, but one of the little nose foot things stays stuck on his face and he smiles and says, \"Let's not say mean things that we'll regret.\" I say, \"Don't patronize me.\" I am angry and am saying exactly what I'm feeling. I know these are my friends and afterward we'll still be friends. I'm not so stupid I'd throw it away on an argument. Now we are on the streets. There is no parking place to be had. I look ahead and see the parade coming right at us. We are forced to turn and park on the side. My friend tries to say this is the best spot, we're in the parade. Then a woman comes up and hands me a sticker and an ink pen. She waits. I realize this is a sticker for a booth owner and will cost us $40.00 dollars if I sign it. We confer. $40 is too much for a parking space. I explain this is the area where food booths and such are set up. I think about selling my books but it's not worth it. We sigh and prepare to go on. Here we thought we'd get to park for free but the establishment was waiting for us, and our money. You gotta pay for what you do."

That's too much for a tiny bag of snacks. She says the bags are bigger. I wish I'd brought my own snacks on board. Now in the sky I see a weird, small plane next to us and it shouldn't be there, and then somehow I am on that plane and so are some other women and babies and some men. An older man is the pilot and the men, including my husband, are cruel and horrible. They take the women into another room and rape and abuse them. The children are abused. I refuse to go in and I am forced into a tiny cupboard. The women don't fight back. They give in and do what they must to survive. The man is taking us to Washington because that's where he wants to go, not Hawaii as we wanted him to do. Finally, he lands somewhere and the men all get off the pane to do a ritual something. Maybe the old man is dying. I see some of the women go outside and then come back with bars of chocolate. I say, \"My God, where did you get that?\" She says he had cases of it all along. I go get a huge bar of chocolate. We are getting food and water and talking. Then we see the men are coming back. It is unbearable to think this abuse will continue. I hold a baby whose ears are terribly stretched and malformed because of the abuse. She looks like Dumbo the elephant with her ears. I say, \"Who will stop them?\" A woman stands with a stick. I join her with a stick. The man comes to the door and he wants in. We poke him with the stick and make him stay outside. This angers him and he sneers and slams the door shut and locks us in. I say, \"We have no water. Someone get water.\" The men are swarming toward us. I get in the pilot set and turn on the ignition. The propellers cough and get caught in the hair of the old man and then it breaks free and I yank on the steering wheel. I hear the men laugh, \"She doesn't know how to fly or land.\" They are grabbing at my legs from the open door on my left. I say to the women, \"Protect me, get them,\" as I frantically try to get above them. Earlier we said we'd stick together this time and fight the men. They do help, but one man clings to the plane as we rise up I get higher and higher. He'd be killed if he dropped. The women let him in. I say, \"Keep an eye on him at all times.\" They agree. We're flying. I hope I can find a place and hope I can land safely. I think for a second about the men, feeling mean for leaving them helpless on the island."

The captain of the boat is male and somewhat scary. He's trying to get my money and things. I go out on the deck and watch as we start going through the water, a big lake. Then I see Lucy didn't make it on board; she is swimming to catch up, she and her girl child. I yell encouragement to her. She can't reach the ring on a chain at the end of the boat. We are speeding up and she'll be hurt or left behind. I throw out another donut ring like thing (a lifesaver thing). She catches it but leaves her child behind in the form of a small frame with the child photo in it. I see this, hesitate and then dive in, thinking to myself this is stupid, now you're in danger. But I retrieve the photo frame and get back to the boat. Now to get on I must crawl through a tiny plastic covered port hole with a garbage disposal thing in it. I push the shredded salad fixings into the garbage disposal to get room to get through this I try several times. Finally someone on deck, a naked woman, helps me up through this. Now I'm on deck and Lucy sneers at me for being so stupid to dive in when it was unnecessary. She had the photo; it was just an empty frame floating in the water that I retrieved.

A boy got killed out on the deck. I go in and see some men, possibly the Captain's men. I get to my cabin to pack quickly. He's tried to steal all my riches, money and jewels but I've tricked him and already hidden them in a secret compartment in my purse. Now I'm wearing a dress suit and heels I get ff the boat and start walking up a steep, gravelly path. It's hard going and I keep glancing around, expecting the Captain to come to me and take my purse. I pick up a rock to use as a weapon, put it down and choose another one with a sharp point on it. I keep walking, noticing other people are around on the hillside and so on. I feel a bit safer."

I need to go back up to the surface and I swim up and up, finally breaking into the air, and discover I am in a deep pond and have traveled back to medieval times. A village is in a meadow and a castle up near the mountains. A prince lives there. I come out of the pond and two young men come by and think I'm a lost princess. They are giving me a tour of the place. I look over to the castle, knowing the prince will come out and maybe find me. I see a deep pit where some poor people are. I say, \"What is this?\" They say this is where the poor people live who don't have any home. I say, \"Then I will stay here for now.\" They are appalled. I am too good for this place, but I feel it is the right thing for me to do at this point, while waiting for the prince to come."

Then another one goes by with another movie star. I relate this to a man, and I can't remember Jack Palance's name and describe the movie he was in and so on, then I remember his name. The head knight comes into the room, which is an adjoining connecting room to the one I'm in and says, \"The dragon is here. Quick shut the doors.\" I see a slithery, huge green boa constrictor-like thing that slithers into the connecting room. I slam the door shut. I struggle to lock it. The knights are called in to fight it. A small rectangular opening panel in the top portion of the door is open and the tentacles of the dragon start to reach through it. I slam it shut and try to hold it shut. It almost gets me. Then I get it shut. He's huge and breathing and in there. We wait. The knights now go down the hall to sleep. I am a princess now, and there is my queen mother. I pace. Now the door is open and the face of a huge green dragon is in the doorway. I pick up a golden bow and arrow and try to shoot it myself. The arrow is weak. It hits its mark, but has no power. He laughs at me. I try again. He says, \"Only you can kill me and only with the golden arrow.\" I call out to the knights. I run down the hall, pounding on the doors of the bed chambers and yell, \"Get up. The dragon is here.\" They stumble out sleepily. I run back into the room and look to see a huge golden and white dragon, the King Dragon, it is now transformed to. He somehow hands me some small golden and other colored round circles like sparkly confetti. I hold a small cross-shaped metal thing in one hand. I put the round circle on it and throw it at the advancing king dragon. His head is getting closer and closer. I throw and throw and finally I pick up the golden one, the One he gave me, and throw it. It hits, and falls off, but it is enough. The King dragon kind of smiles, and is very close to me, and then blows a breath right in my face. He laughs because I had slain him as I ought to have and he was making a joke about being a fire-breathing dragon, all dead now with not even a hot breath left to get me. He says, \"Throw it in again.\" I pick up the thing and throw it at him again. He is stopped. Somewhere in there my mother the queen says something and I tell her to shut up."

I get in the way of a man looking for more tourists for his boat and force him to take me. I get in his tiny blue boat, but get back out because it would mean I'd travel alone.

I think about how I'll have to leave my chair here and then decide I'll need it on the island and think it into the boat. A young Malaysian woman sits in front of me.

She says, \"I wasn't going to say anything, seeing as how it is cultural ignorance, but--.\" I say \"It's OK.\" I feel caught and embarrassed, and yet, how was I to know? We go on.

We prefer to not have it around.\" I am angry because I had been harassed and hounded and feared for my life because of this cape. We (the two men and I) ride out into the snow. Finally, in tremendous anger, I force the one man off his horse. He is shocked. I scream at him. I am angry. We'll finish it now. He is going to strike out at me and I don't care. I am livid with anger long held in from his bad frightening attacks on me. He is Indian and hides in his yellow fur parka and I made some sign at him and say, \"You stay in there; you can use the shield.\" Somehow his spirit was going to come out and kill me and I am fighting it. It's like I've gone berserk from the pent-up up rage. They aren't going to treat me badly any longer."

The ocean is off in the distance to the right, so when you want, you can go sit at the window and look at it. There is a kind of wooden tree fence which has spaces between each tree so you can still see the ocean, but it is not a totally open view. This seems a good thing.

She comes in and says, \"We need to do it now.\" I'm not ready, but I gamely say I can do it. I kinda think maybe I can manage it. I need to go to the bathroom. We're sort of in the old M City house. I go upstairs and step into a tiny bathroom at the top of the stairs (which never existed in the real M City house). The toilet is broken. There is no seat; it is blue and chipped and not too clean. I remember there is the regular bathroom downstairs at the foot of the stairs and decide to go where it is more comfortable. I kind of peek into the door of the bedroom that used to be my parents'. I don't see much. I go back downstairs. I see a very high step where one of the steps had been removed, probably the one that squeaked and was cracked when I lived there. It's hard to make the step, but I do. I knock on the bathroom door. A woman opens the door and is showing me creams and things for the face, like I was a teen and she was showing me the right way to do makeup. She takes a huge glob of Vaseline in one hand and a huge glob of lotion in the other and mixes them together, all the while lecturing me how oil and water don't mix and this will be very bad to do on the face. I think this is a waste of lots of material, because she uses so much. I leave, not buying anything, feeling a bit guilty as she wasted so much to show me. I go into the kitchen, and pick up my papers. I need to buy stamps now for the teaching job I'm about to do. I buy them from the woman of the lotions. I go into the other room and ask my woman boss did she pay the woman for the stamps? The boss says, \"No, you need to do that, but I can partially reimburse you later.\" What a nuisance, but I return to pay her I ask her how much I owe. She figures for a while and then says 140 dollars. I am shocked that is much more than I thought it was worth. I am frustrated, but feel I must pay it, but resent it. I start to take out the money and first give her some coins -- quarters, pennies, a half dollar coin. I ask how much I've given her so far. She says, \"You're one point short.\" I am annoyed. What does that mean? I ask shortly, \"Does that mean 99 cents?\" She sighs at me, exasperated. \"98 cents,\" she says, like I should know that. I've got a long way to go to make 140 dollars. I pull out the cash, and lay out the full amount, not liking doing this."

Now a fat woman named Velma (from high school) says she's getting married right now. She wears a pretty pink night gown and I go get the baby bonnet made and give it too her to wear as her veil. I give her the orange cat back. I carry it to the car. Her husband gets in, she gets in and I hand her the cat. They drive away. I go in to transplant my plants and take care of my black cat."

This isn't usual for him to be demonstrative. It's a convenient part of the procrastination, but now it's nearly time to be on stage and I quickly come up with an outline. We get on stage and I look around at the few props and so on and we begin improving dialogue. Then I realize we are on the wrong stage. This is the backstage, behind the one where the audience is waiting. I can hear them. A crewman comes and I say, \"How do we get up on that stage?\" I see a crawl hole I might have to climb up, a tight fit and a tough climb. Then he helps me and I tell him go get the props and be sure to bring my power wheelchair. I'll use it in part of the play. Now I am seated in the wheelchair. I hold a microphone in my right hand, and light a cigarette (for the part), kind of surprised I allow myself to smoke. I kind of enjoy doing it again. My chair gets a bit caught up in the fringe of the curtain and I struggle with the mike cord, but get on stage and begin the play. I circle around the stage examining where the props are so I know what I have to work with. I see two pianos, and one has ink pens on it for the survey bit and another has matchbooks on it. I notice that the grand piano can't be played from the position it is in and decide it doesn't matter. A woman comes in and she sits and gets a massage. I create dialogue with her as we go. I say, \"Are you here for a nice massage?\" She says, \"Yes.\" I suggest after the massage, she start filling out the survey (seeing as that's the structure of the play, that survey about relationships). We doing OK when I realize the audience is far away; there are not very many of them. I see a row in the front of seven or eight women and then lots of empty seats and some more people scattered in the back. The curtain isn't fully open and blocks us from the audience view. I wheel over to where the curtain is partly open, more at the center of the stage, and send my dialogue at them, but must return to the side of the stage where we are doing the play. It is uncomfortable, not working well."

He does. I go down a street and see a store and go in to get my newspaper.

A woman stands right behind me saying she can see I'm being fitted, so she'll follow me so she can get fitted. I am annoyed and say I am not being fitted. Each halter top is alike, a white square top with straps that force the boobs up prettily. Some women's boobs sort of drop under the wire cup outfit a bit. I decide since the president is here, I'd might as well take advantage of this and go complain about these changes in the sidewalk that now make it harder for me to get around. I go down and find both Bush and Clinton there. I walk up to Clinton and say, \"Although I have to blame Bush, as it was his administration that made the plans, it is you that has to change it back. We have to be more aware of the environment and how it affects the disabled.\" He looks annoyed and I say, \"I know it costs money and is unpopular, but it has to be done if any change will happen.\" As I continue talking, I am now talking to a president who is a woman. She hands me something, a lacy cloth \"paper.\" Another woman sits on the couch and says to her, \"Well, you sure have pretty feminine paper here.\" The president says, \"I get a lot of teasing. The men don't like it; it will take some time for them to get used to this change. I notice my lacy panties are down around my ankles and I start to struggle, pulling them up. A man is seated across from us and he is trying not to stare. I am trying to be subtle, but in fact I am standing there hiking up my panties. I get it almost up and give up in frustration, sitting down with them uncomfortably wrinkled up almost at my hips.

A woman, perhaps Charlene, watches me, admiring my steps. I get to the corner, where my boyfriend waits for me. He and the young man are playing a dice game and I tap dance around the dice.

Dwight says, \"Let's go to a movie.\" I say, \"OK.\" Dr. A then comes in and suggests we go to a movie with him. He asks if Jake is responsible enough.

Dwight tells me that the cat he'd been taking care of died. I look out the window and see a tiger striped cat and say, \"No, he's right out there in the garden.\" Dwight says, \"That's a different cat.\" The cat turns and looks at me and I see the face is different. I give up working on the graphics thing, because I can't get the screen part to stand up at the right angle. I place a ruler under it to hold the angle, but it doesn't work. We go out with Dr. A. I whisper to Dwight, \"Is it OK?\" (meaning not to go to the movie he requested, but go to Dr. A's movie) He says, \"It's OK.\" We go down the hall. I see a sign that says, \"Negative Hypnotists\" or something like that. I think this means this is where patients are taken when the prognosis is negative, to see how they will cope. We go in and I immediately realize this is a psychological testing area (not paper and pencil test, but experimental). The room is huge, long and narrow. A long, long table runs the length of the center of the room. I look around and see Dr. A has chosen a chair in the corner, facing the wall, with his back to us. I say, \"Do you have to sit in the corner?\" (a joke). He doesn't respond and I know that is because he must be a neutral observer and not influence me. I look around and see three or four tiny kindergarten chairs and the examiner seated in one of them. I choose my chair, across the table from him and Dwight sits on my right. Lots of people then enter the room, crazy or depressed or strange people. They wander around the room. I watch. Then a large, muscular, fat woman with short hair comes over really close to me and leans into me. I turn and say to her, \"Get back from me.\" She is belligerent and leans even further into me and says, \"Does this bother you?\" I say, \"Yes, it bothers me.\" I shove her away. She comes back. I say, \"Barb, move back.\" I shove her again. She's hard to move, but I am strong and surer of myself. She repeats this a number of times and finally I manage to push her to the floor and she gets up and leaves. Now everyone leaves. I am alone in this huge room and the doors and windows are shut and bars slam down so it's very obvious I'm being locked in all alone. I feel confident. I know this is a test. I'm not concerned. I even smile a bit at the dramatic flair they do this with. I go to one window where the bars are coming down. They are wooden slats with pointed ends. These ones malfunction and kind of fall softly down and don't completely lock me in. I smirk. Then I walk the length of the room just looking around. As I approach two doors, I see they are partially open and then across the room a white wooden door is slammed shut like someone has just run through and left. I know it is unlocked and they expect me to be desperate and try the door to connect with someone, but I don't feel desperate or curious. I 'd rather explore the two open doors. I go to the first one and push it all the way open. The title of this room is \"Fighting Woman\" room. I go in and see feminist books and hear a recording of feminist books. It's a nice enough room. I go out. I've heard all this before and I go to the next room, the support room. It's a support group therapy room. A body is laying on the couch, covered by a blanket. He starts moving like he's waking up. I see another body on the floor, perpendicular to the couch, her head between the couch and the wall. She was sleeping and is waking up. I step over her to the door. I don't want to stay here and deal with them. It's boring. I am back out in the big room and see the door marked \"employment\" and feel some regret that it is locked, but I'm still in that secure, confident place, knowing this is just a test."

I arrange them on the side counter and then I am now putting silver forks in one dish, and spoons in another, and knives. Some are still wet from being washed.

The usher, a woman, sets a chair for me and I tell her I need one for my friend, should she come. She gets it. Now the audience comes in and there are folding chairs set up. A large crowd is in the next room area and then just as the play is to start, they walk across the audience area, to leave. They are some other group. The video cameras and lights go with them. Now the play starts and it is a series of scenes involving kings, magicians and puppets. I am impressed with how well the actors are doing with only a few rehearsals. They are off book and have done some nice things with puppets to augment their small numbers. Some audience members chuckle at my humorous lines. It isn't an overwhelming success, but it is an OK play. The king announces, \"I am the King,\" several times. I notice the actor who is about to enter and exit from my side of the wings is pulling the curtain closed so I won't be able to see. I say to him, \"Psst. I am the playwright.\" He is annoyed, but complies and pushes the curtain open so I can see. He'd rather have closed it for the convenience of the actors and the production."

She is folding laundry and Aunt Esther or Aunt Charlotte is visiting. Aunt Charlotte is wearing a black print dress and Dora pulls out a white, pretty dress from the laundry basket and says she can wear this one if she stays overnight. Bonnie holds it up to herself. Her hair is dark black and she has a pale complexion, so the white of the dress isn't all that complementary to her. She'd rather wear the black print one again. Dora is folding up bras and is searching for one that is comfortable for Auntie. She looks at one that is counterbalanced and says, \"Maybe this one will help.\" They are all quite large, like \"D\" cup size. Aunt Charlotte then starts twirling and dancing and singing like she's pretending to be on stage and I think, \"She really does have talent. It's too bad she isn't doing anything with it.\" Dora then turns to me and says, \"We'll have to figure out something about the throat\" (I'd had a coughing thing when I was being visited by this man, maybe Dovre's young man, Dwight. I'd impressed him with my humor but I'd had a coughing thing where I had to excuse myself from the room to choke and cough. He thinks I'm pretty talented. It was too bad about the throat.)"

I am aware that if I had taken the initiative and rehearsed, I'd not be in this predicament. I go in search of the teacher who is rehearsing a woman singing. I stand there, edging nearer to get her attention, which interrupts their rehearsal. I am envious of the woman's singing ability to do opera. My throat can't do that any more. The teacher is annoyed with me. She goes to the piano. I am crying copious tears that drip onto the piano.

It's my roommate's room. I take out three pies from the oven and take them in to the table, with my oven mitts on. He is impressed; I am happy. I set the table, with his plate at one end and mine at the other and a third plate on the side between us. I realize I didn't give him the biggest baked potato as I had planned and exchange it. He demurs, but is pleased. He sits and I sit. He says, \"This is too far away from you.\" He moves his plate to the side close to me. Now Ellie and \"I\" come in to visit and \"she\" pulls us aside to explain she wants a night alone with this man (she's now sort of like Judy P). We giggle and leave to go to our house. We walk across the unkempt, wild yard to our house. Our third roommate is watching TV and I tell her of the date. She recognizes the man and says, \"He's not a doctor, he's an actor.\" I realize he's a fraud trying to con her. So we rush over and pound on the bedroom door and look in the window. It's too late, he's in bed, maybe they already had sex. We sneak around to where he's left his coat and bags. I search for his car keys. I find them and hurry to take his precious car for a ride to pay him back. He's coming toward me so I rush, I drive out and he chases me calling stop! Stop! I want the car to be a sporty car and have trouble getting it to appear so. I drive down a bumpy gravel road and see a road block up ahead. I slow down and the men working the construction let me through. I take a sharp hairpin curve up a side road up a hill, slowly. I go up to a promontory and peek over, watching for him. He arrives huffing and looking all around for me. He's very handsome. The men point to the road I took and he's running up the hill and I slowly drive down the road, luring him on. I know this switchback will take me almost back to the house, but he doesn't. He's lost and upset. This is a great joke. I feel very satisfied I've taught him a good lesson he'll never forget. I stop, get out with his flashlight and wait in a tree as he retrieves his car. He hesitates and calls out he'll give me a ride back, he doesn't feel right about leaving me alone in the woods, but I don't respond and he finally drives away."

As I prepare to walk to my center seat by the king of the country I am visiting, all the religious types file out, so they won't offend me with their presence. I go and sit by the king, but not in the chair provided. I sit up on a table, on top of income tax forms. The crowd is luke warm in their reception with the exception of one woman who is standing and facing back toward me applauding. She sees she's the only one and stops, confused. Now the star, a woman in a manual wheelchair, comes out on stage and makes a sarcastic remark at me, something like, \"We'll wait until you are ready.\" I zing back a sarcastic remark like, \"Oh, you sing?

It's not too good as other stuff is on the board and it blends in. I write my name, Barb Sanders. I then go to a boy and question him to see what kind of innate intelligence he as. I ask him if Nanu the whale was born with three different colors and it was dark when you saw him, would you see the black color part? It was a trick question. The boy had some ability. Now its break time and I walk around and see a group of women prisoners seated together talking. I try to join them, but they don't want me there, so I go to find a place to lie down and soak up the warm sun. The row of cars parked in the lot leave and there is a line of logs or boards left.

I try to shake it off but I can't. Finally I ask a woman to help me get it off. It's a bit creepy not knowing where it is. Now I go to the priest to check out the man and the priest tells me the story of the man's life.

We keep walking, then we realize we left the little girl behind at the house. How embarrassing and what a bad thing to do! We look back and see a long line of people parading and she is in the line, in a cute bunny suit with a curly wig on. We are relieved she is coming to find us and a bit concerned how she's getting sucked into the cult's activities. We circle around to go back to meet her and lose her in the crowd. The cult leaders see us and are moving in to entrap us too. We keep moving. Now we enter a town and try to find a building to go into to hide. We don't and then I see another huge body of water where crocodiles are swimming and snapping. We decide it is safer to stay on land; there are still crocodiles but we can see them coming. They come and one bites my leg. I peel him off and use a piece of wood to stick in the jaws of oncoming crocodiles. The place is infested."

The first run through he's the driver and I'm the passenger. I watch as he drives and try to remember the curves. We come around one and he says they didn't let us know it was so steep a curve before. He's slow and cautious. He passes two slow cars on the right. I am urging him to go faster and thinking I'll really go fast when I drive, and wish I had time to practice with the clutch so I can feel it right. We get to the finish and have to return to our place in the bleachers and then return for my driving part. I somehow get lost or decide to skip that part and I show up without the car or Andy and realize he won't know I'm there and we only have 5 minutes till start time. I tell this official woman who suggests we page the bleachers. She turns on a microphone and says for Andy to meet me there. He does come and I apologize several times for not being at the right place, and thank goodness this is working out. Now we are in a line, only where I am standing is in a small, cold freezer chest for food. I realize this is where they keep the food and back up out of it. Andy goes to the head of the line at the counter to get our fees paid and so on. Two military navy men are behind me and talking. One says loudly, \"Look at the son of a bitch,\" meaning me. I turn and say scathingly and angrily, \"Oh yeah? who's the son of a bitch?\" We stare at each other confrontationally. I feel powerful. No one is going to mess with me. Then I notice the man at the counter is giving Andy trouble and asking for 10 dollars instead of the 7 dollars. I push my way up there and lean on the counter and chew the man out. I yell like a drill sergeant and say, \"Either you straighten this out or let me speak to your supervisor, ass hole\" He is arrogant but the woman supervisor hears me and comes forward and fixes things. She gives us our tokens we have to place at particular curves and the necklaces we have to wear. I ask her two or three times for clarification on whether a specific token must go at a specific curve and if I have to wear the specified necklace, because I saw one metal round one with two blue herons carved in black wrought iron on it and want to wear that one. She agrees it doesn't matter. Now we are finally ready to do the drive. I am ready to put my foot to the metal and speed; I test the clutch and we are off."

I watch as they all line up at their spots against the side walls and put their heads to the wall like in hide and seek. I think, \"How interesting.\" They probably had to train a long time to be able to do that. They have sacks over their heads. I feel gritty stuff in my throat from the duck shit kiss."

I assure them he probably would feel confident when they correct the error and show him how they can stick to it and fix things. I suddenly realize the man seated with us is the client they are worried about. I begin talking to him and realize he is a very nice man. He plays baseball for a living. I say, \"Let's go jogging, but I have to go to the bathroom first.\" He agrees. He follows me, talking, and we are having a great time getting to know each other. I come out of the bathroom and he is seated and I ask him something and then I see he's crying. All the tears are streaming down from the right eye as I face him. I say, \"Let's talk.\" He sits at a table. He hesitates, but I am such a good listener that he talks of his troubles and pain. He says, \"You are very good at this.\" I say, \"I am a professional.\" He says, \"Then I must pay you.\" I say, \"Oh no, because I offered it as a friend.\" I feel very tender and like this man a lot. Now we go out to do a jog only we find Dovre and we are going to visit her home.

I feel claustrophobic and scared but we get through. Dovre reminds me to step off and walk normally when the green fake grass like belt ends. I do so and now we go into the house. Dovre says something to the man, who doesn't respond. I say, \"He's hard of hearing, repeat it.\" Then we go in and I am going to introduce him to my parents and my \"brother\" and my \"Uncle Bob.\" I debate if I should announce he is hard of hearing and decide to trust that he can take care of it himself. I say, \"This is my parents,\" and so on.

I go back out to the big room and go around a corner and see Ellie's side. She has a beautiful closet with all her clothes hung up and pretty things and lots of room. I say, \"Maybe we can move things around so I can share this space. I can bring my bed in here, and use that yellow room for writing.\" Then I look out the window.

He comes softly to me and suggests we debrief our travels. I look around the room to see what other group members he meant and see I am practically the only one there. He meant me. I agree shyly. Now I touch his face softly. I feel wonderment and sadness and love. I had been so blind, so numb, I had not given a moment's thought or feeling to what I had with me all this time. I am very touched. He is happy I finally have connected with him in a loving way."

I turn back and can see the master bedroom through the window of the kitchen and I see a beautiful fountain, a water fountain. I point it out to my mother, who looks in the wrong direction. I keep pointing and trying to give her verbal direction, but she just can't see it. I say, \"By the brick fireplace.\" She just can't see it. I give up. We leave, thanking the woman owner for the tour."

It seems that lots of Charla's toys and junk from Ellie living there are piled up in the corner. The boy wants to play with his toys, but there is no room until I get the other stuff picked up. Now Ellie comes in and wordlessly starts picking up things. She pulls down the Christmas lights from the wall and other old decorations. It is way past Christmas. This is encouraging. I say I want to talk with her. The boyfriend realizes we need privacy and says he'll go to the other room for a while. Now Ellie and I sit side by side on another couch and I am very angry at her and I am slapping her face, only now Ellie is a tiny baby and I slap her face over and over. Now we decide to go upstairs to my bedroom for more privacy and Ellie leads the way upstairs. It is hard to walk up the stairs and the entry way is a cubby hole, not a door, which makes it physically hard to even get in. Then after we hunch down to crawl through, we have to step on a rickety ladder of sorts built up with like video or CD cassettes in a wooden rack which my boyfriend had built for me. That angers me too. Why did I choose such a difficult entryway to my own comfortable and nice room? [BL]"

I open it and discover it is a sugar-glazed donut and feel real upset. I want to eat it but am afraid, because of the sugar. I almost decide to eat it but then give it away to the tall, large-chested man who seems to be enamored of me. I look for some other treat. I see a display of baby food jars and think about that, but decide that's too bland. I decide to return to another room where there are fruit-sweetened treats. He follows me. I can feel he really loves me and wants me. I seem to be drawn to him as well. We go into the room and he is showing me a special house he built that is earthquake proof. There is no roof and hardly any walls. I say, \"I guess about the only place you can live in a house like this is the Southwest.\" He agrees. I sigh. I guess I'll have to learn to want to live in the Southwest. We go outside the room and suddenly he kisses me. His big rounded chest is very prominent, and he has to bend forward to be able to get around the chest to kiss me. He starts taking off his jeans. I say, \"Please,\" I feel rushed. He is gently pushing me into the room. He lays down on the bed and asks me to take off my dress. He wants very badly to see my breasts. It is a passion for him that the breasts be the way he likes them. I feel embarrassed, rushed, and also feel his desperate, warm need. So I let him take the dress off as I sit on the bed with him. He pauses to say in a strangled voice of how terrible it is to be afflicted with such a strong need and not know why. I remember then, that he had told me his father had died in his arms, and right after that a large, buxom woman came into the room and comforted him. I realize this is why my breasts are so important to him. I say, \"What happens if my breasts aren't right?\" He says, \"Then I'll love you anyway.\" He then gently sucks on my breast like a baby. I kiss his arm gently. It is sexually exciting."

I know something is very wrong and don't know what to do. I remain calm.

He has moved his things in and a huge black and white bed takes up the entire room with maybe a dozen pillows across it. he turns down the comforter and we get in. He also has maybe four teenage boys. One wants to sleep with us. We laugh and send him on to his room. He goes in and there is bedlam going on in there as they noisily fight. One teen daughter is in there. She's the only nice one. I guess his kids didn't turn out well. Even though he's a wonderful man, his children are ruined. We cuddle up lovingly in the bed. Later, I am coming back to the apartment and a woman stops me and says, \"I'm so glad I met up with you. I have the address of a place where you can write. It's one big room, the owner keeps fifty books there in a stack and the rest of the space is all open. If he moves in more books, he'll prorate the rent.\" She writes down the address, maybe like 219 Ausilaudes. \"You don't have to live there,\" she says. \"Just go there each day and write.\" I agree I need to do that and thank her for the address. Now I'm walking across a porch where small open boxes are displaying segments of a mystery story. I'd been curious to know how this story went, so I walk and look in each box which depicts a scene. \"The battery,\" I say. It was a foreshadowing at the beginning. Now I understand why. My man is being attacked by horrible round organisms that are just a circle of color. They voraciously eat everything. and if he stops emitting this high-pitched noise like a scream, they will close in on him and eat him alive; me too. I am swimming in a lake and they are under the surface, coming at me. I scream and scream. This is an endless struggle. Finally his noise-emitting thing's battery runs out and he is trying to get a new one in. In the seconds while it's changing, they eat him up. I keep screaming and screaming. Finally I am exhausted and simply give up. They decide I shall die slowly and painfully, and I see myself bruised and battered and exhausted, waiting only for the agony to end with death."

A man wants to sit in it with me and I am hesitant. He slowly comes over and sits with me. We are uncomfortably squeezed together, but it is intimate and the man would like it to be loving. I am unsure. Now a Dr. McCoy kind of man prances around and says that housewives are lucky. They have the house. He goes over to a tableau of plaster statues to point out the house and as he gets in there, one breaks. The crowd is stunned. A priceless work of art is now shattered into pieces. I realize he is a trickster kind of character. I watch as he brings a piece of the face to a woman who had lost a loved one tragically. He says she can...something, maybe relearn or integrate. She holds the fragment of the face and traces its shapes with her fingers and says, \"I'll have to have new clothes,\" and she stands and starts to talk about the face and herself. Meanwhile Dr. McCoy sits in the easy chair with me, like the other man had, and I am crowded and a bit tense. He smiles gently and says, \"Let me in.\" I turn my head and smile timidly up at him and we maintain eye contact. It is beautiful and moving and loving. I am suffused with warmth and love. I touch his arm, indicating I let him in. I lean back into the circle of his love. It is overwhelmingly beautiful and warm."

I stroke it with my hand and he says in a gasp, \"Are you sure you should do that? I'll only last about two minutes that way.\" I smile because I realize I want it to last longer. He says to me, \"I am surprised you allow me to make love to you, you're a professional and important and I'm just an old boy from Texas.\" I say, \"But you are a nice old boy from Texas. You are kind to me.\" I smile and say, \"Lots of them have asked, but you're the one who is really nice to me.\""

He is helpful, safe and strong. We are in a taxi and I am tired, having been traveling for some time. We go to a place, a counter where I can pick up my belongings, like a post office or airline place. I see my things are out of their package, and I ask the clerk if she has a large garbage bag I can use to put the loose things in. She doesn't understand at first, then gives me a padded one. I tiredly ask what the return address is on the baggage, so if any of my stuff got lost, it would be sent there. She says some long strange name with lots of \"W's\" in it. I am upset. That is my ex-husband's address. How tricky of him; now he'll get my things. How unfair. I drag my stuff to the taxi and sit in the back seat with the lieutenant. I cry on his shoulder; he likes me and is sympathetic, but a bit distant. Perhaps he's afraid to be clear about his feelings, it might make me more upset. We get to the town and I say, \"You won't like this, but I've forgotten to get my suitcases. They're at the bus depot. I only have the clothes on my back.\" We get out. The estate looks kind of small and tacky. There are a line of small, tacky cabins on the front part of the property, facing back to the one on the hill, a steep, dirty hill. I want it to be better and will it to be better. Now we go in and I see room after room, all of them in the wrong places. A bathroom first, a kitchen and the living room off in the back of the house. I want it to all look spacious and rich, and manage some ornate furniture. I go out to the back where a curtain is across the back full wall window. The corner of the curtain falls a bit and I see a beautiful view. I go out on the patio, a wooden deck and admire the mountains in the background. Unfortunately, right next to my property is a wire fence and a bunch of large construction trucks and tacky, bare dirt. Behind a wall is a small, covered swimming pool. I say to the lieutenant, \"Oh, this must be the one warm day of the year. I suppose (it's September) that that cold season (I couldn't remember the name for Fall) is starting tomorrow. His back is to me as he's looking out over the vista. He says, \"This is Juneau, it's warmer here.\" I say \"Oh, I forgot, this IS Juneau.\" We go back inside. A cold, well-dressed woman comes in; she likes the lieutenant and doesn't like me. She hands me a book that will tell me about the woman who left me the estate. I see a 1920's cupie doll kind of face, on the book cover. There is some mystery here, some sadness, she got used somehow. Now an old butler speaks, but I don't see him. He introduces himself as the old retainer and will be happy to stay on and with his wife the cook and so on. I hesitate, it sure would help, but I ask, \"How much do you charge.\" The woman implies I shouldn't worry about it, I've got a pretty good deal here, with the estate. Maybe it's all paid for."

I am walking around a large house with lots of interesting floors and no walls that I am aware of. There is a dirty water channel around the house like a moat. Dangerous fish monsters are in there and if you swim in it to get to the other side, you are eaten alive. As I am walking from room to room, I pass two young, leather-jacketed men, teens really, and I am exclaiming how wondrously beautiful the world is, shimmering, sparkly beauty. They approve of me. Not many people notice. I walk up a path and see a large green lake on the left. A man is laying down on the edge of it looking at it and saying, \"How pretty.\" I say, \"But cold. It is fed by glaciers.\" He doesn't believe me. I say, \"Stick your hand in, you'll see.\" He does and it is very cold, like ice. Someone remarks, \"This lake has been many places,\" and I ask, \"How can you move a lake around?\" I go back into the house area. Maren has returned and is interested in debating me about reincarnation. Then I realize she means to quote to me from the Bible to argue against me. A man comes to me and says, \"I want you to see the new water.\" I am impatient but follow him. He takes me to the dangerous channel. He wants us to cross it and see the new water over there on the other side as well. I look at the channel and see it is blue and solid, with a thin water layer over the blue solid \"floor\" laid over the channel. He says to the keeper of the gate, \"We want to cross.\" The gate keeper is nervous. The man says, \"I'll hold back the bear.\" I watch as the gatekeeper is trying to open the valve to let the crossing be safe as a huge bear is trying to eat him. The man is wrestling with the bear, holding him at his huge, gaping mouth. The bear has stretched his neck out long like a dinosaur's neck. It is overwhelming, but the man barely manages. Now a couple walks across the channel and I, in a prom dress, nervously step across. I am worried it will give in and I'll fall in with the monsters. We get across. The couple goes to the meadow and walks away; the meadow has that same thin film of water over it. The man says, \"We'll go up higher. Push that button.\" \"What button?\" I ask. \"That one,\" he says. I see two. \"Which one?\" I ask. He laughs and says, \"This one, right in front of me.\" I look over and see a button he is looking at. I step over and push the button and a small square platform I am standing on begins to go up and the man steps off. \"Aren't you coming?\" I ask. \"No,\" he says, \"the platform isn't stable enough for two. Sit down, he says. \"What?\" I say. He says \"Sit down, it's safer.\" Now it's going very high up and I sit, facing the mountain cliff we are rising up, very aware there are no walls and I am afraid of heights. I concentrate on looking at the solid cliff and not to look down. I get to the top, but the fun has gone out of this as I am alone and the man isn't there. I look around and then return back down. Now I see the water has returned to its original brown, murky dangerous way and realize I can't get back home. The man is over there. I ask, \"What happened?\" He says, \"We couldn't hold it. It disintegrated.\" I am very distraught. Now a woman, sort of me, but I am watching, dives in and desperately swims to the other side hoping she makes it before the monster fish get her. She almost makes it, but a huge brown fish comes out from under the bank and pulls her back under by the feet. She is dead and gone and eaten. I stand on the bank, knowing I can't go home and wanting to. Somehow I do manage to cross and return. Now as I am walking on the floors, I step hesitantly, half expecting the floors to have soft watery spots I can sink into and be eaten alive by the fish monsters."

My Aunt Esther is there, as young and pretty as in her prime, maybe early 20's. Her hair style is very 1940's and luxuriant. I remark how pretty she is. I want to tape things good this year and go get my video camera. I find the camera and the cord, but no batteries and no tapes. I desperately search and find other kinds of tapes, but not for the camera. The aunties are seated around an old oak dining table and are starting. The room is empty except for them and the table. The kids are playing in another room. I try to remember what they say and how they talk. Now I am very sleepy and lay down on the foot of a bed, apparently in another room. Katrina is laying on the bed and I move my head so I don't lay on her feet, but she gently replaces my head on her feet so I'll be more comfortable. I am so sleepy that I continue to not respond and she takes a pillow and places behind my knees and gently moves my legs so they will be straight, as it is bad for me to sleep all curled up. My joints will stiffen that way. I start to slip and I slide right off the bed and onto the floor. Then I get up. I'm hungry and go to find the cookies in the kitchen. I see lots of different kinds of cookies but not the kind I like (chocolate chip). I also see a chest of drawers and I rummage around and see jewelry and books and things. I try to organize them. Now I go outside. I've apparently been exercising and gaining strength and now I go down a ladder, wearing sneakers and a jogging suit and attempt to walk on the beach. I am elated. It's a dream come true. I see the waves at the surf's edge, the foamy white little waves and happily walk in them, feeling strong and vigorous. I look out to the sea and notice a breakwall with the ocean beyond it and then a wave about hip deep sweeps over me and I enjoy that, but am now a little concerned. I look again and realize a tidal wave is coming and I turn and run for higher ground. It roars over me and I am dragged and then deposited on a wooden fence-like thing. I hang on and look again to see even a bigger wave crashing over me. I hold my breath and go under. It recedes and then I see bird like dinosaurs, huge and non-thinking, eating the running and screaming people. I hide down behind a wooden fence, in the grasses, between rocks. My little girl is with me and I hug her to me. The dinosaurs pass over me and sniff, they kind of know I'm there and can't find me, but are getting very close. Another wave comes over. I hang on, hoping desperately we'll be safe. They eat more people. Now I peek out at the ocean and see it is running sideways. The current is like a river and huge plumes of exploding water funnels come up and dissipate. Something is very wrong. A dinosaur reaches his head over where I hide and is sniffing very close."

I say, \"Is that a good thing?\" He says, \"Yeah, it was strategy.\" Then one of the football players grabs another one and physically picks him up by his feet and his hair and carries him to the referee who sits on a high seat by the goal posts. The guy had cheated or done something unsportsmanlike and he's being taken to the ref for a fine or a reprimand or something. I laugh and say, \"Football! Can't they just play the game? What's all this macho stuff?\" The crowd shifts uncomfortably, a bit ready to heckle me for having a negative attitude about football. I feel that keenly and snort a bit more sarcastically. They respond one notch more, grumbling and hostile. I say to John, \"They do that one more time, I'll do it. I'll just say it.\" We are on the edge of them booing me and calling me names for being a stupid lady and I'm on the edge of calling them stupid and so on. John grabs my arm and says, \"Let's go.\" We start to leave. Now I am the pudgy woman friend. John's woman tells him his wife/girlfriend is in the hospital. The babies are seriously in trouble. John says, \"That's terrible, but what can I do?\" She soothes him and assures him it would make no sense to go to the hospital and be there. The pudgy woman is in the elevator and John and the woman are waiting for the elevator. She says to him, \"You know, you are too rough on her. You criticize everything she does. Her ass is too big, she doesn't talk right, she should do this and that. It's a wonder she isn't having suicidal thoughts. She just loves you, you know.\" \"I know, \"says John, \"I wish I could be more like her. She's so caring and sensitive.\" Now the pudgy woman gets out of the elevator. John somehow shows her the newspaper headlines about the babies being seriously in trouble and she sees this and starts crying and sobbing and running. She must get to the hospital and do whatever is possible to do. She's running down the hall to another elevator, sobbing her heart out. John is filled with guilt and remorse. Why can't he be like that? She is so giving of her love and he is so selfish and self-centered."

Derek is standing and walking into the kitchen and back to where I am. I am aware that both my being on the floor and his walking are not really possible. I look at the photos and say with some respect and awe, \"Hey, these are like Steven Spielberg's special effects.\" \"Yes,\" he says. \"Did you use special equipment or machines?\" \"No,\" he said, \"I did it with perspective.\" And he points out how something in the foreground and something in the background are sized to make a unique perspective. I am very impressed and then realize these are far better than any of my photos. I say, \"Maybe I shouldn't show you any of my photos.\" He agrees. I feel a bit hurt. I need to go to the bathroom and he says, upstairs. I walk up a long flight of stairs, realizing this should be difficult to impossible, but I'm doing fine. I find the bathroom. As I come back out the bathroom into a hall, I see an older woman and several younger women talking, perhaps about me, in whispers. I now am passing the open bedroom door of Derek's bedroom, on the left at the top of the stairs. I can't resist looking in and am specifically looking to see what kind of bed he has. It is an ordinary double bed and I am glad. It looks inviting. I go fast down the stairs, which are lined with books along the wall. I go so fast I almost skip stairs and trip myself up. Derek walks toward me, his sexy eyes clearly indicating he is sexually interested. I feel warm and responsive. But somehow, we are taking things to the kitchen and we go down another flight of stairs to a big open space. I look again for a bathroom and find a huge public bathroom and can't find the toilets. I ask a clerk at a window and he points to a room. I go in and it's a communal bathroom. I pee, somewhat self-consciously as the door is open and people are wandering through. I come back out and now am back in the living room and lying on the floor again. Derek walks over and lies down beside me and pulls out a condom and just shows it to me. I look at it and then at him and he smiles like a clown and makes shapes out of the condom, a mushroom shape and other things like a balloon clown would. I feel shy and sexually excited and he looks over at the stairs invitingly. I go to the stairs. At the bottom of the stairs, I sit down and he comes over and kisses me, lying down on top of me saying, \"If you don't want to do this, now is the time to tell me.\" I want to do this and kiss him passionately, sexually aroused."

I turn, wet hair in a towel, and put my hands on her shoulders to stop her from leaving the room. I say, \"We can work this out. Let's talk. He didn't do this.

There might be different main types or groups. They are docile and unemotional. Now a big bad guy in black, like a Roman Centurion costume, comes into the picture. Somehow we are in a confrontation and he has set it up to where every time we demand something from him, we will have to hurt one of the women, who are now referred to as goddess. We'd demand information and he'd refuse to give it and a docile semi-comatose goddess would walk up to be punished. But we decide rather that each time this happens, we do not hurt the goddess.

Some woman relative says, \"...But Dovre is so angry at Derek. If he has to go pick Charla up, she'll be mad at him.\" I say, \"Then I'll go get her.\" I see Charla isn't in the script in the second half and notice there are only long monologues for Derek and me. I see Derek sitting in an easy chair and I hop happily into his lap. I realize that's a bit intimate, so I scoot up on the arm of the chair. I alternate being in his lap and getting up on the arm of the chair. I tell Charla she can stay here with the relatives for a while, as she's not in the script. I am relieved she takes it well and is happy to stay. I see two young men come in and I think one is just like Tony Curtis. Is he a cousin or an Uncle? I am trying to remember. It seems he used to be a relative many years ago. He says hello to me and I realize he is perhaps a son of the old one I remember. He doesn't remember me. I go to Aunt Naomi and ask her if that was Tony, not the Dressel one, but the one that I might have know many years ago. She is surprised and tells me a story of a young man she loved long ago. I say, \"But have I met him?\" She says, \"No.\" I realize she thought I was being psychic and clicking in on her past love. She is very tall. Now I go into another room. Derek is there holding an oblong box with lots of buttons in it, a musical instrument of some kind. Uncle Joel is there. Derek also has some golf clubs. I teasingly take one and we tease back and forth about how I don't know how to play golf. I say, \"Sure I do. You take this club and you...\" I look at the ends. No hitting part. So I tickle Uncle Joel's nose with it and we laugh. Then I take the box and try to play a song. At first it is random notes and then I start to get the hang of it and play a nice rhythmic rumba kind of music and end on three bass notes. Everyone is laughing happily and applauding. It is very joyful and I feel good about having figured out how to do it and do it well. I then look at the buttons in the box and realize I've mushed them all up until they are a messy mass of what looks like rubber eraser bits. I say, \"Oops, hope you can put it back together\" (to Uncle Joel). I then realize it's almost 2:00. I get up to go change my clothes to go to the taping. Uncle Joel is seated on a stool and is sad. He tells me how he used to be good at things and now he can't do them any more. He just tried to read for five hours and on the short reading tests he did OK, but on the longer ones he couldn't remember what he'd read. I am very sympathetic and tell him how I've had to go on and learn new things and give myself grace and time to get good at the new thing. I sort of am aware I'm lecturing, even though I am genuinely sympathetic and loving. I look over at Derek to see if he noticed. Now I'm holding Uncle Joel's hand and I'm walking away to go change. I still have his hand in mine and turn to see that Derek had exchanged Joel's hand for his own and is walking behind me. We go into the bedroom and I see it is 2:00 now. \"Oh,\" I say, \"We're late....\" I rush around getting the clothes. Derek is very mad at himself for being late again and slaps himself on the legs. I say, \"...but first I really got to go pee.\" I rush for the bathroom."

I go in just as he is opening the door to the bedroom from the hall. He is standing, wearing a tank top and some leotard-like, flesh-colored outfit, like he's naked, only he's not. His legs don't move, and in fact I don't see legs. He's sort of stiff. We make love passionately. Now I go out and see Derek in a car. There are five cop cars in a line and his car is right behind them, a perfectly safe place to be. Another man is in the backseat of Derek's car and he opens the door and invites me in. I get in, happy to be alone with Derek. I curl up with the other man who says it's OK to press back against him if it's more comfortable. Derek gets out to rearrange himself and his assistant helps him back into the car. We are going to be together and that makes me happy. [BL]"

Now I call to the kids to come into the house NOW. I am angry and demand they come. They saunter in, being insolent and rude. I slap some on the face repeatedly. I yell at them.

I see two wall phones, and in black marker ink Derek has written some things like, \"I feel....\" It is all about how wonderful he feels when he is talking to me on the phone. I see his bed. I notice where the pillow is and go near that end to see what he sees when he's there. I see he has arranged dried flowers, colorful ones, lots of red, and a mirror and pretty things like driftwood and so on. I like the pleasant feeling it gives. I see a night table and see the answering machine and am pleased that he can hear me when I leave a message late at night and he is in bed. Now his attendants are there to help him get in bed. A man is working his catheter, four women are on a couch, two other women on the floor to my left. I am standing there, not knowing what to do. Derek is talking to me. He is gruff, distant and angry and he is also telling me to get in bed with him. I sit on the edge of the bed next to him as he turns himself to lay on his belly. I see rough, raw, red skin near his ankles and a flat wrinkled butt. He turns and looks at me, waiting. I take off my shoes and peel off my socks saying, \"I hope you don't mind my cold feet.\" He laughs angrily and says, \"You have so many layers of fear up here (he touches my forehead brusquely) and I am naked in a bed with you and you're worried about me not liking your cold feet?\" He snorts derisively and lays back. He's now on his back. He says, looking at me coldly, \"Now is the time to find out if this works, before it's gone too far and it's too late.\" I sigh and say, trying to kiss him on the mouth, but he pulls sharply back from my kiss, \"I'd rather take the test and fail then not take the test at all.\" I curl up around his chest and try to kiss his cheek. He pulls back coldly. His hair is nearly shaved off, he is skinny. I tentatively kiss him several times more and keep talking. I say, \"You talk about me. You have five heavy cement walls, two moats with dragons in them, dungeons and two alien spaceships guarding the fort.\" He smiles and returns a sweet kiss. He is lightening up. He says, \"What's your middle name, honey?\" I say, \"Jane. My name is B. Jane. Darryl used to call me Barbie Jane.\" I say, \"What's your middle name. Oh, no, I know it already, don't I? It's---it's Dwayne.\" Now he turns his head to kiss my breast and I am sexually warm all over, even though I am still dressed in bra and panties. Now the interruptions come. Charla is there and bouncy and full of energy. Some friends drop by and talk. Charla goes out of the room and down the hall to ask a man a question. I get up and try to call her back. She comes back and Derek asks her what size she is, period. She says, \"Over 24 inches.\" I laugh and laugh because she has figured out why he asked the question and knew the right answer. \"You have to be over 24 inches to be able to ride the amusement rides.\" Derek calls someone, a woman named Jean, an attendant, to come and he pays her to take Charla to the amusement park. I notice water is spilled on the wall and go over to wash it off. Derek and I are talking back and forth, like couples do, making inside jokes and comments meant only for each other's ears. Now three different people come in, a secretary, a man and another woman helper. The man says, \"Oh, it sure is busy here now and I can see I have to defer to the head Mother,\" meaning the secretary. He goes and the secretary says she got a call from Guns and Roses and they want him to do a conference at their concert in North Carolina, but he is scheduled that weekend at San Francisco. He says happily, \"Cancel San Francisco and make the date.\" Now he says to me, \"I'm going upstairs now.\" I hesitate, not knowing if I should stay here or go with him. He smiles and says, \"Bet I'll get there before you do.\" I say, \"I'll take the elevator.\" I am walking and I push my power chair to the elevator and get in. A woman in there has to help me pull up the chair over the tall first step into the elevator. Now we are upstairs and I decide to call Sebastian Fox, a friend of mine, because I saw on the Guns and Roses poster he's the warm-up band. I get him on the phone and he says, \"Sebastian and Carol.\" I wonder for a moment if I'd accidentally called my cousin Sebastian. I ask him if he remembers me. He says, \"Sure,\" and I ask about if he's booked for the concert in North Carolina. He says, \"We may be, depends which concert they get assigned to.\" I say, \"A friend of mine is going. He'll probably be at the smallest concert because his stuff is about disability.\" I hear Derek off in the distance saying, \"...And what do you feel about that?\" I say, \"It's a shame because he's really good and very funny too.\" I say, \"You know I've been thinking I'd do conferences on dream work.\" I want Derek to hear that because it would be great if he and I did those conferences together and traveled and worked together. The feeling I get from Derek is warm and positive and responsive."

I wonder if I had done these; probably not, since they are so good. I can't do this well. The first pictures were pencil sketches of hands, somewhat crooked fingers, like mine many years ago. I think, \"That's interesting they are like mine,\" and then I think, \"But, of course, they are. People create art like themselves.\" One picture is over two pages, a skeleton in the sand on a desert island. The next page is his skull. Then there are missiles with smaller missiles coming out of them, four pictures in a vertical row showing the smaller missile coming out. \"Looks phallic,\" I think. I examine the picture closely, thinking, \"Naw, there's no way I could have done this one. Maybe I did a collage, but it is obviously not a collage.\" Now I close the book and look over to Howard, who is in a narrow bed. Under the bed are piles of my clothes. I see a huge ant who picked up a crumb or a maggot and is lugging it over to the clothes to eat it. I am fascinated. I look at the bed and think, \"If you put a box over it, a person could set it up so you'd have everything you'd need there. A great bed for an invalid.\" It looked a bit like a coffin. Now a little girl comes in. I'd heard her in the bathroom throwing up. She is crying. I say, \"Not feeling good, huh?\" I feel a bit guilty for not having gone to help her. Then she looks distraught and I see she's having diarrhea. I say, \"Oh, it looks like you've got the stomach flu. Go on into the bathroom. It's all right.\" She has left little piles of shit like chili con carne on the floor. I follow her in to help clean her up, only now I see the toilet is overflowing. Water is all over. She's crying. I yell down the hall to my father, \"Hey the toilet is overflowing. Come help get the water cleaned up.\" He comes out to help. The girl is mopping up water with towels. It's a mess."

I gently admonish the director not to make fun of people who are different. I figure this audition will be pretty easy, since I'm the only woman trying out. I'm given a fat script held together by paper clips. Now other women come out and it's not so cinchy any more. I'm told to read the part of Ana. I look for where she comes in. Three other women are on stage doing parts and I am now concerned and struggling to find the place they are at in the script so I know when to enter.

I come out and say to the director, \"I can't find the right page. I think it's missing in the script.\" I go to the front of the stage. It is very high up from the auditorium floor. The stage is slippery and I'm in socks. I can barely keep myself from sliding right off the edge and falling. The director is very distant, way down there, and he's annoyed. He's also concerned that if my script is messed up, maybe others are too. I feel guilty because I know it's my fault I can't find the page, not that it is missing, but I don't say anything. I have to grasp the curtains (a flannel or felt material -- one yellow, the other another color, perhaps blue or green) in order to stop myself from falling off the stage. The director gives me an 800 number I can call to get another script and dismisses me. I go back to try again to find the missing page, because if I go call the number, it will take too long and I'll lose out. The director has lost interest in me."

The back bedroom was a remodeled add-on. Derek says, \"There's one bedroom that isn't being used.\" I say, \"Not only that, but there is more to this house. I like it better. It's bigger and the rooms are more interesting.\" I go down the hall and pass through two kitchens, each one fully equipped. The one in the hall has two refrigerators. I open the French-doors with glass squares to the spacious living room. There are big windows on the far wall, very nice. We look in. It is fairly empty. I wonder why I don't live here, and not in the small older square room I currently live in. I go on down the hall and show a bedroom, and at the end of the hall is a double connecting door. I try it to make sure and the inner door is locked, meaning the other side of this house is occupied with other people. I remember that last year I lived for a while in this side and had a hospital bed in the bedroom. I can't remember why I moved back to the older part. Now I want to go into the spacious living room and show Derek. We go in. I notice a hilly knoll of grass that needs to be tended to on the floor. I see two fireplaces and a kerosene heater, and a small electric heater. I see bookshelves on the wall, only it is all covered with knickknacks and clocks. Derek says, \"You've got some really weird stuff in here.\" I say, \"It's not mine.\" I look around. Lots of the clocks have seashells on them for decoration. One clock has two small secondhand circles. The hands are going around very fast. Derek asks me if I ever go to the coast to write. I say yes, I'd been to N City. He asks if I liked it. I say yes. I keep looking around and see a lawyer's glassed bookcase with weird knickknacks and wine bottles in it. I want the case, but not what's in it. Now we go to the bedroom and look around. A woman is there. Paulina at about 5 or 6 years is there. Derek and I had left our wheelchairs in the hall. He walked with a limp and a cane. I got back into my chair so he wouldn't feel bad. Now see Derek is seated in the wicker chair at a small wicker dining table. I choose to remain in my wheelchair and bump the table several times. I know it would be more comfortable if I transferred also, but I stubbornly don't. Paulina and I are talking about last year. We're playing a card game. (I wake up for a few moments and go right back into the dream. I am aware that I've dreamt this house before.) Now Derek and I are in another room and Paulina mentions a bunny. \"Oh,\" says Derek, \"I want to see the bunnies.\" I sit where I am and Derek goes into another part of the store and returns with a towel. He puts it in my lap. I know by this that he's decided he wants a bunny. He goes back to pick out one. I say, after he's out of the room, \"I want to help choose. Paulina had a bunny last year. I want one of the round cute fuzzy ones.\" He goes upstairs and comes back with a flat kind of bunny. Now I have a lap full of six baby bunnies and a mother bunny, maybe the one from last year comes in and nests with them, like a mama bird. Another white one comes in. I pet it and it meows. I am surprised it is a cat and still wants to nurture the baby bunnies."

Dwight and I are talking about what we're going to be. I say, \"I wanted to be an artist and I wanted to be a writer but it's not going to happen. I used to be a counselor and a teacher but I can't do that anymore because of my arthritis,\" (and I feel a bit guilty about that because I know that's not completely true). I feel like I'm drifting. I don't know what I want to do. Dwight is hungry and opens up a cupboard where I'd cooked left-over lunch, taco pizza. It looks pretty gross, but he eats it anyway. Now, I'm trying to run a writer's group, with Aunt Elaine and some young cousins, maybe Uncle Lionel. I can't get them to get settled down. They wander around and giggle and talk and interrupt and leave and come back. Finally in exasperation I say, \"This is like teaching kindergarten kids!\" They are sympathetic and try to come to order. Suddenly, I see a huge plastic air-filled duck drop down, like in Mace's parade balloon. It falls into the hedge near the windowed wall. I am amazed and go over, thinking suddenly, \"Maybe there's someone in it. Maybe it's an alien from outer space.\" I get closer and see that there is something in it, eight babies. I say, \"Someone call 911 and get the police...no, the medical people first, to take a look at those babies!\" Someone goes to call. We wait and wait. It's taking them far too long and we get suspicious they've sent for the military. I say, \"There's no way I'll let the military guys come in here first without making sure the babies are all right.\" A man now comes in a navy uniform, only it's a captain of the work crew that's been building the submarine complex out in the bay or ocean right outside the windows. Someone had called him about the duck, Murphy Salvage, or something. I explain we're first waiting for the hospital people. I put in another call. They are cold, distant and confused. Now I'm alarmed they are up to something. The Captain pulls me aside to talk. I say to him, \"Too bad your sub isn't ready yet,\" because I know he's just recently sent up a work crew to rest or something and it was empty. He says, \"Well, it is working, technically. A few men are down there. It's almost ready for its shake-down cruise.\" I look at him, wondering if we could hide down there. He then smiles at me and begins to say something like, \"I've always liked you but somebody had to do or say something to let the other know they're interested.\" I look at him surprised. He then leaps off the table he's sitting on and gently but insistently pushes me up against the windowed wall, where outside the waters are churning turbulently. He kisses me. I am aware that it's an OK kiss but not really exciting and he's OK looking but not all that handsome. I think, \"He has tufts of hair in his ears and a bit of a paunchy belly.\" After the kiss, I say to him, \"Well, I never even thought of this as a possibility before.\" I pause as he waits, thinking over my feelings, and then I say, \"I'm willing to 'work at' the possibility and see what happens.\" (I use an academic word that starts with \"A\" for \"work at.\") He is very happy. He has a chance. We are all going to hide the duck on his sub and he will court me in those rough waters."

I watch, as the story unfolds that for years she's been abusing him in horrible, torturing ways, handcuffing him to the wrong place on a trailer and then driving, him being drug on the dirt road, the wheels just barely missing running over him. He cries and begs for her to stop, but she just laughs crazy like Sybil's mom. Finally, the pain of being drug is so bad he tries to get himself situated so that when the handcuffs release, he's in the path of the wheels and he'd be run over, killed, and put out of his misery. I feel painful empathy for him. Now she's in a house telling him to get ready for bed, she's got his medicine ready for him. She goes into the bathroom and pees and has a bowel movement into the water and then she's going to put it in his medicine. I am repulsed by what I see. She sees me watching and screams at me to get out. \"Get out.\" Now there's a dad too, a retired military man who works at a boy's school. (He describes how careful you have to be and not be in the bathroom with a boy alone.) He's usually gone, but occasionally comes home and has violent sex with her and with a woman friend of mine. The dad and mom love/hate each other very much. He has some white cream in a tube he puts in her vagina or on his penis. He wants her to eat some. She refuses. I take a small bit into my mouth, like being nice and helping him to feel better and not rejected. My woman friend also takes a taste on her tongue. Then he says, quite chattily, that he's had syphilis for 20 years. He starts to describe the symptoms. I am sick and ask permission, \"If you don't mind, I'd like to rinse out my mouth.\" I try to rinse and spit to get it all out. It's a bit foamy now like shaving cream. I hope I got it all out before I swallowed any so I don't get diseased. Now some fat secretary woman is describing how he'd lock her in the bathroom, her in her black slip, and take a whip. (He'd be in full military uniform. I'm amazed because I thought he was just a psycho security guard or something, but it's a real military uniform.) \"He cracks a mean whip,\" says the woman, \"and it really hurts.\" I feel the pain on my butt in sympathy of her real pain. I flinch. This is a sick and crazy man. Then he insists I make love to him and twists my nipples to stimulate me. I feel sexual excitement and do it."

And as I watch, the horses have loosened themselves from their stalls and are slowly drifting or sliding over to the back edge. They are going to fall off and hit the road and I'll be killed and so will they. I slam on my brakes to get some distance between the upcoming accident and me. As a result, an eight-car collision occurs. Now we are stopped, and on the side of the road. I am dazed. I look into the rear view mirror and see the cars all smooshed up, fender to fender. Everyone seems unhurt but angry. One of them marches up to my driver's side door, which is open, and starts to lecture me on being more careful. I am furious and tell him off, explaining that I probably saved our lives by doing it this way. Now another man comes up and asks me if I'm all right. He's very friendly and seems gentle and on my side. I suddenly get suspicious as he gets into the passenger side, that he is a doctor. He agrees. He is a doctor. That pisses me off because I hate it when some one is kind and caring because it's their profession or it is in general for everybody. I want that to be for me. He is suggesting we drive to the hospital. I ask if they (the police) are done with us, and then I am driving away, assuming that they are. I am flirting gently with the doctor. We drive to his house. He is married and has kids and yet it is clear he likes me very much. He says, \"Can you manage to go over there?\" \"Where?\" I ask. \"To the barn.\" I go there, wondering what this is all about, and trusting it. He has a one-horse sleigh and we're going to take a ride. It is sweet and romantic. He helps me in and wraps a warm black fur blanket around me tightly, like you'd tuck in a blanket around a baby. I smile and then get worried he's pinning me down, my arms, and I'll be taken advantage of. But I calm down and trust him. He shows me there really is a horse in the barn, meaning we'll really go for a ride. I ask how we can do that with no snow on the ground, and he says it has special wheels on the skids. Now his teen boys come in and are very curious about who I am and why I'm here. They seem to understand that their father loves me and it's OK with them because they want their father to be happy.

So he returns to high school to hang out and becomes a delinquent. He plays mean tricks on people and is insolent. A woman teacher (dark hair) is walking down the sidewalk. It's lunch break. The boy says to his cohort, \"Hey, I'll pay you 75 cents to moon her with me.\" The other boy says, \"Nah.\" The boy takes a pair of scissors and snips off a bit of his hair. He says, \"OK, then a buck.\" \"Nah,\" says the other boy as he snips off another bit of hair. The other boy says, \"For 1.50, I'll do it.\" The boy is upset it is so much. He must be losing his control, but he agrees. So as the teacher walks past them, they pull down their pants. Her first initial automatic response is to gasp and get angry and righteous, but she realizes this is exactly what they want and so she just says, \"Huh,\" like she's bored and walks on. She's quite please she figured out how to let the air out of their balloons! She is very upset and thinking hard, because she's on probation. She has stood up to a student (male) and people are upset with her. It isn't fair. As she walks, she sees an orange and white cat who she wants to pet. She stoops down to pet it and it loves being petted, laying down on it's side and purring as the teacher strokes its soft and sometimes matted fur. Suddenly she looks at her watch. It's 1 o'clock; she's late. She turns back and walks toward the school. She notices the houses on the left. One is a single room, empty, pretty, but too small. It has a step, but on the side is a ramp. \"Good,\" thinks the teacher. The houses are older and nice. She now either recalls or receives a phone call from the mother of the male student who she stood up to. The mother is nasty and mean. She is saying that the teacher just isn't understanding enough. She misunderstood the student's intentions. Did he speak to you in a mean way? She sneers like that is going to prove the teacher wrong. The teacher tells her it's the mother's fault and this annoys the mother very much. She makes a sarcastic remark, thinking she has proven her point that she is right and the teacher is wrong and hangs up. She leaves her room as her husband is entering it. The husband says, \"How are you?\" She grumps, \"Yep,\" well satisfied with herself. The husband shrugs and ignores her. Now the teacher is nearly to the school and decides to go in the side door and hopefully avoid the main office. She hopes that there was a fire drill so her lateness will not be noticed. She sees that along the wall of the high school are displays of different breakfast cereals: Wheaties, Cheerios, Men's____ (like study group) and on the left side of the sidewalk is a stack of cereals called \"Misjudgments. 50 ways to count.\""

I see cars driving in the river and wonder how they can breathe in there, because the car looks like it is under the water. I look more closely and see the water is only up to their necks. Close enough, I think. I decide to go away from the river. I am going against traffic. It is hard and slow. I round a corner and see a glimpse of the ocean where the river runs into it. The waves are huge and white and foamy as they crash against the rocks. I want to go down on the beach. A man also wants to go there and we sort of go together. Now we are on the beach. We pass a room where it's a sort of a glassed-in museum and a 95-year-old grandma is inside telling the visitors whatever they want to know about the things in there. I am curious and sign up for my turn to go in. Now I have my girls and a young college age girl as part of my party to go in and see the woman. The man and I are friends now.

I sort of want to work and yet I am not completely trusting that she isn't just some fake guru and will lead me astray, and I'll be sincerely working only down the wrong path. Now she's ready for us and he calls us to come quickly for our time with her. I call out to the girls who are scattered by now.

A woman is at my right. Derek/man is seated in the easy chair with me at my left. I can't really see him. I just sense his closeness. I am shy and afraid to look at him because I love him and he doesn't love me. Reynold puts on one of my hats with silk red flowers on it. He's laughing and looking silly. I smile, the hat starts to break up and a string of those red flowers goes from the hat toward me. It seems symbolic. There is an amazing abundance of those flowers. I am surprised. I only remembered two of them. Derek/man says to me -- I see him how seated a short ways from me on my left -- he says, \"Just now, when I said this, what did you feel?\" I look at him and smile gently and answer truthfully from the heart what I felt. Then I distract myself and pick up a small computer toy game. I idly start to fiddle with it, actually thinking of playing it while I sit here at my birthday party. Then Derek starts softly singing a sweet love song in an Elvis Presley type voice. It is something about I love you, but you don't know it. I feel such love for you, etc. I sigh and am touched and keep my face shyly averted from him because it is too heartbreaking to hear him say those words, knowing they aren't for me. A mentally retarded woman is standing to my right and she is saying something and I turn toward her slightly and listen, not wanting her to interrupt and letting her interrupt. She says she's leaving. I say goodbye. I notice a thick layer of dust on the computer games on the table to my right. He slowly moves around until he is more facing me and so close. I look up and he is in a kissing position. His eyes are filled with love and his voice soft and sexy. He kisses me tenderly and lovingly. I melt into it shyly. I am so happy. He does mean those words for me. Then he whispers, \"But look at the dates! The 9th, the 22nd and now the 26th!!\" (cousin Lenny's birthday, his birthday and our day of falling in love together). He says, \"I've known you for a while, but I just fell in love with you two minutes ago.\" I reach over and kiss him again, being careful to make it a short kiss so he won't think I'm trying to be demanding or sexual. He asks me how I feel right this minute. I say, huskily, \"Good. A minute ago, I felt bad and sad. And in a few minutes I will again. But right this moment, I feel good.\" I am flooded with a rising tide of loving feelings. I am suffused with love and sweetness and tenderness."

He and I are interested in relationship but are shy and concerned. We are flirting and courting and getting serious. Now it's time for another meeting. the big meeting. I go there; the man is coming a bit later. I get some info out of a drawer, some pictures of athletes as possible evidence. I get to the room; I'm a bit late.

He doesn't like committees and meetings, but he's willing to help out. I am seated between a suave, good-looking, vain man and his mother. They are gossiping about women and who he's dated. He sees a name (c:\\sherial) on a car and takes it down. He'll call her,;maybe he already had a night with her, he can't remember. Now it's time for my man friend to start the meeting. He's going to sing and dance. He's wearing a woman's tap dance outfit and silly lipstick and wig. He taps and sings beautifully. He's built like Archie. I am smiling at him and winking encouragement. I think he's terrific. The good-looking man gets jealous and tries to grab me and kiss me. I slap him across the face just as my guy is tap dancing around to our side of the table. I know the suave man did that to get my guy jealous so he'd lose his step and ruin the presentation. My guy grabs me and dances with me like its part of the routine. He says, \"What's going on?\" I say, \"Nothing, nothing. Don't worry about it. He just made a pass.\" He gets jealous and I insist he dance on. He finishes the dance. The suave guy says to me, \"What do you see in him?\" I say, \"He's so talented and interesting and hey, he's got great boobies\" (meaning the fake ones he's wearing). \"Besides,\" I say, \"you are boring.

I answer it and it's for me. Some woman asks for Jiving Joe, and asks me how \"the Ladies\" went. She meant my Play, \"Ladies mayhemming society\" and how the rehearsals went, or the performance, I'm not sure which. She's an intimate friend of the man's and is semi-teasing me as well.

I try and try to get it to lock. It won't. It's too late to go out and find another place to hide. So I see a smaller room, a closet and get into it. It has a working lock.

It's soft and loving. Then my mother comes out and says, \"It's time for the presentation.\" I am annoyed because I want to stay with this warm, loving feeling with the baby. I then hand the baby to a woman and wheel inside. I see a huge room, where many people are seated around in a circle, on ritzy couches and fancy chairs. I look for a good place to put myself so I can see everyone and they can see me. Derek is now on one of the couches. I avoid him, taking great pains to snub him and not give him eye contact. I chose the head of the room, by the huge fireplace. There is also a skeet shoot apparatus up on the wall to my left. Derek encourages the rich man who lives in this mansion to shoot the birdie. He tries a couple of times, but it is all weak and ineffective. A silly coo-coo type mechanical bird flaps his wings, and a sort of pop gun goes off. Now I begin my lecture. I want to keep it informal and answer questions. The topic is dreams. I say, \"I know lots of things about dreams and my bias is Jungian, but I don't want to inundate you with all this. Just ask me what you want to know and I'll try to answer it.\" I am watching the words I use so I don't trigger Derek's automatic responses around 'know-it-all left brain language.\" Some ask some questions and it goes on. Now it's over and a man, like Richie, Kyle's brother, also a rich man from this mansion, is seated on my right. He is telling me how much he has wanted to meet me because he'd seen pictures of me and I'm fabulous and he loves me and would like to have s-e-x with me. And he goes on like a star-struck fan. I say to him, angry and bitter, \"I am 51 years old. You are young. This is stupid and won't work.\" He ignores me and prattles on and on, very gushy and intense. I want to leave now.

I fight and scream, \"Leave me alone, no no!\" I break from his grasp, and I see Derek is frantically getting into his chair to come beat up Walter and protect me. I am sobbing violently and deeply. I drive away in my chair to the van and Derek follows. I am screaming, crying and he won't leave me alone. He hangs onto my handles and hitches a ride with me; he is concerned and loving. I am deeply hurt and sad. This Walter, who I don't like and don't want, wants me. Derek, who I love and want, won't have me. It has been this way all my life. It's not fair.

I see a house near the ocean where the side yard literally is the ocean. The children of the family are swimming in it and playing on the rocks in the water. It seems so convenient and wonderful. I feel a bit envious. A young 12- or 13-year-old girl is in the water and someone asks her if they can look at her nose, because she'd had plastic surgery done on it. She is annoyed at their curiosity. Now I see the man I had rejected in the front seat of a car. The passenger side is open and I go to speak to him, to be comforting, as he is hurting from the rejections. A young girl, maybe the same one, comes up and wants to hug him and I hold her off, thinking it would be too teasing, as he can't have what he wants. Now his mother drives up and gets out, walking over to us. I say to him, hanging on to him so he won't run, \"Here's your mother.\" I want him to face her. He feels very rejected and hurt by his mother. She is pretty, with bleached blonde hair and young-looking, but she is older, with wrinkles when you look closer. She's very egotistical and self-centered. She has a dress in her hand, one I used to wear, and is offering to sell it to me. I lay it out across him and me to look at it. He is sort of half laying, half sitting on the seat, diagonal, so his feet are toward the open door. I am seated on the edge of the front seat, facing the back seat, sort of. She points out the beaded strands and the young girl is looking closely at the weave so she can make one like it. I decide to defend the man and I grab her, the mother, and the dress and I am marching her back to her car. I start beating her up with the beaded dress, now big wooden beads, and it hurts her. It's like I'm flogging her. I am angry and selfrighteous. She abandoned the man as a boy and she has no business or right hurting him now. I drag her to her pickup truck and make her drive away. Now the scene shifts and I am married to the man. I had seen the errors of my ways and am being caring and committed to him. We run an inn or a restaurant and I have an apron on, I have dark hair and I am saying, \"I need to take my husband his dessert now.\" I am very loving to him and so happy I had seen my mistake and changed. I had almost made a bad decision when I first chose not to marry him."

I'm playing Christmas carols, \"Away in the Manger,\" and \"Oh, Holy Night.\" At first, it is a bit difficult because of my fingers, then as I continue and practice, I get better and better, not even trying to find the right note, just flinging my fingers and they hit the exact right spot and the most beautiful music comes out. It's sweet violin music. Now a group of interns and the doctor come and surround me on the bed. They are poking and talking and I demand that they stop. I say, \"Stop this. Tell me what is going on.\" They ignore me and I get more insistent and loud. Finally, I get the attention of the doctor, a haughty man, who condescends to listen to me for a moment. I explain how demeaning it is to be ignored. It is my body and I have a right to know what is going on. Now that I got their attention, I let them do the tests, which ends up like a kind of surgery. They make a mistake and I am permanently brain damaged. I am innocent and pliable. Someone decides to marry me because I have great wealth and they want it for themselves. An older man and his son are arguing who will be my groom. I am on the arm of the father. I wear a beautiful, white bridal dress. I vacantly smile and I'm serene. Even though I have some consciousness, maybe my dream self feels worried I'll be hurt and taken advantage of. We are in a vehicle, where I and the two men are in the backseat. The father is on my left and the son is across facing me. I look out the window and see buildings and then see the hospital I had been in and get upset and don't want to see it. I get agitated. Now we are at the place the wedding will take place in. It's a big room. The dancing starts as I sit alone for a moment on a bench. I see three women decide to dance together to start the dancing. They do back flips and strange moves like that. They wear long dresses that are pretty, vibrant and sexy. A man asks his wife to dance and she says, \"Not now, here let ____ substitute.\" It is a boy. The man and the boy dance. I decide I have to go to the bathroom. I get up and wander away. The dream conscious one knows I'll escape this way by getting lost and they can't find me, but the bride doesn't know anything. I go around the back around a building like a grown-over path through an old orchard of trees. I find the shit house, which is filthy and full of shit. I am disgusted by the idea of my white pristine dress being besmirched by all this shit. I go further and see a gate. It's an old wooden one. I open it and go inside. It is a dog kennel. There are lots of large, black dogs, maybe Labradors are being bred there, or housed there. I stand looking. Some men are at the far end. One man -- ugly, large, and mean -- has a double gauge shotgun. He begins to threaten me by pointing it at me and then begins to fire. Bullets hit the wall behind me very close. I am in danger and yet I am still very serene. I wait patiently with just a bit of alarm. Some men try to tell him not to shoot me. He fires the gun at them too, narrowly missing them. Now a beautiful hunk, the hero, in a tan leather jacket, good-looking and capable, comes around the corner. The dream consciousness knows he's the one that will rescue me and I will end up marrying him. He stops the mean guy from shooting at me and the dream fades out, with the dream consciousness knowing it will be a happy ending."

I get there and get out of the van to see that there is a flight of stairs up to the church. I sit in my wheelchair, waiting for them to come out and get me in. They have to pick me up, four men, and carry me up the stairs to the stage. I know they are embarrassed and am glad they have this visual lesson. I sit proud and tall. I look down at the audience and begin by talking about how huge and spacious the room is and how it dwarfs the audience with its presence. I then tell them how distant they are from the stage and how unusually high the stage is from them. I use this as part of my lecture on how they choose to keep themselves separate and distant. I am honest, forthright and kind."

We are walking down some flights of stairs to find a quiet place to talk. I open a door and see a Hult Center type auditorium with some show going on, on the stage. I close the door.

We admire and look at what's on the tray -- red and white striped ice cream swirled in a dish, a bottle of what looks like champagne, but my mother looks at the label and we agree it's almost champagne, the cheaper version. My father is smiling, very pleased with himself. I am a bit annoyed, but still trying to get the attention so I can tell this interesting dream coincidence thing. Now I see my father has on some kind of mask which hides his gentle, kind face. I try to speak and he sounds like he wants to hear, but then he interrupts with a story of his own or something and I go quiet. Now Aunt Rosalie is having an argument with Sparky off in another room and I feel angry and put upon. My day is getting spoiled. I feel guilty because my relatives have somehow taken over this day and Sparky is going to be mad at me because we've moved in and not paid our share for the rooms. I didn't mean for this to happen.

This makes the teen daughter happy. I walk past and am touring the house. I see a large room with lots of spacious windows. The river, brown and muddy is swirling in and rising. I am a bit concerned, but not too much. Perhaps it won't rise so high as to enter the rest of the house. I see an elephant swimming in the river, in the room, and two alligator/part human creatures wrestling each other. I walk on and see an adjourning room, George's brother's room. It too is semi-flooded. Now George is showing me his room. He opens the door and I see a narrow, long, empty closet. I try to see a bedroom. I pull back a cloth, perhaps tie-died, to peek behind it and only see the wall with old wallpaper on it. But now it opens up and is his bedroom. There are plants, a living tree, and huge sky windows in the ceiling. I look up and see huge piles of junk, mostly empty cardboard boxes, empty wine bottles and so on, hanging upside down.

I now walk through back door, a lovely glass door, and see the outside. I see a pond, which is a continuation of the river, less muddy. There's a marker rope and then the pond widens out into a lake where recreation things are happening -- little paddle boats, swimmers, etc. I start to walk over there, but George comes out, perhaps in a wheelchair, and says to me,\"Wait.

I test it out and like the way the wet ink looks on the paper, only it spots a few blue ink marks on my hand. I kind of like that, a mark of a writer.

I go in and am wishful of the beginning time again when things were loving. Now I am in the streets, trying to find City Hall, the City Planning Department. I guess I need a permit or something. Another woman, perhaps a sister, and I are lost. I see a building and go over to it and realize this is it. I go in. There are marble floors, fancy signs, etc. I see the directory. I can't make out what floor the department is on. I go to the elevator and get in, determined to go to each floor, although I think it is maybe 4th floor or 9th floor. A young man comes into the elevator backwards with an old ritualistic step, like a hop (Raymond like feet). I get out and have found the office. My sister Lydia is there and a man. I am looking around the nearly empty room thinking this would be a great room to do my writing in. I go to a window with an attic-like enclosure structure around the window, which makes an alcove, and think, \"This would be where I'd love to put my writing desk.\" I go there and notice that when I sit there, I can see a lovely view of an old Victorian house out the other window. Now the man is in love with Lydia and we are wearing old-fashioned long silk dresses (1800's). She has black hair tied up in ringlets and mine is blonde. The man wants us to go to his house. We do. He is very rich and the house is a Victorian mansion. He introduces Lydia to his mother; they try on a bridal gown for her. I try to take a picture of her and look through the lenses of her glasses to take the picture. One lens is scorched and scratched from her having looked through it. I look at her through it and say, \"Too bad the colors won't turn out well. I guess I'll take the picture just to have a memory snapshot. It won't be a good picture.\" I snap the picture and finish the roll of (reel?) film. I start to open the back of the camera too quickly. I hope I didn't ruin the picture. Now Lydia and the man's mother go out of the room to make arrangements for the wedding. The man comes over to me; he also secretly loves me. I am aware of his feelings and try to deflect or ignore them. I look out the window as he tries to press his face near mine and tries to turn my face so he can kiss me. Finally I say, without giving him much eye contact, \"You love my sister, sir. This cannot be.\" He is sad. He now wants to give me a tour of the house. He goes down to the end of a hall and opens a door. I look in. It's a bedroom, fairly modern and ordinary looking. There are two beds, one with a yellow bedspread, one with a blue-green one. I say, shocked, \"Why have you shown me a private room?\" I realize it is his bedroom. I turn and start to walk away, down the hall. He goes into the room and comes back out hurriedly with a small box that has a bird egg collection. It was his when he was a boy. I am touched. Then Lydia and his mom returns and he hurriedly covers the bird's egg collection with a piece of cloth so they won't see. Somehow this is too intimate for our relationship. Lydia is carrying a huge tray with goblets and things on it. It is too heavy for her and I see from her eyes she is on the verge of being hysterical. He takes the tray from her to help and I say to him, \"Take care of her,\" and I leave the house. I am vaguely aware they are going to send out their car to take me home, but I don't know for sure, so I hesitate and look around. I see a big square limo (more shaped like a hearse, only more box-like). It is picking up or leaving off a young woman in a wheelchair; must be the neighbors. I start to walk. I stop and hesitate again looking back. I see a regular, but fancy car. Maybe that's it. A woman comes around the porch of the neighbor's house and I offer to buy a candy in her tray for a ruble. I see a second boxy limo and walk back. Another woman comes over and says in an angry haughty voice that she is appalled I would offer a ruble to the neighbor woman, thinking she was the maid. Something about not being in my own class and putting on airs."

I am curious what it would be like and it would be nice to be taken care of. Ellie warns me to take the back streets out of town because the main street is clogged with traffic because of a football game or something. I try to, but get all twisted around and find dead ends and odd corners and end up going out of town the wrong way, up over the mountains toward M City (I think I'm in M City). I try to find a place to turn around, but that will put me in the traffic jam. Then I realize the game is started because the traffic has freed up some. I stop by the foster home to check in. The helpers are very busy with the other patients. Two colorful cowboy hats (huge) with little short puppet like legs keep darting in and the helpers keep chasing them away playfully. They are dancers. Two of the helpers are choreographers of dance. I see a table with color pens and markers on it. I realize I'd forgotten to pick up Charla to take to N City with me. I decide to call her and then go back and get her. I try to get Ellie's number out of my electronic address book. I type in \"B\" and it keeps being mistyped with extra letters. I repeatedly try to do it and am unsuccessful. I finally realize I'm in the wrong search mode. I also realize this isn't the right place for me. They do too much help; they are used to patients with severe difficulties and I'm really quite self-sufficient. I am a bit embarrassed. As I am leaving, one woman has penciled in art work on her white smock or blouse. I comment on them. She has started to color them in. I comment on the brilliant purple and orange colors. I like them. If I stayed, I'd probably want to use those coloring pens and draw something. As the woman goes out ahead of me, she's saying she won't be here Monday night, and I know that I won't be coming back here. I'm going home after my N City visit. I feel good about this decision."

I won't touch you if you don't want.\" I smile. She keeps close and wiggles around so that she is actually permitting us to be nearly touching, shyly letting me be close. I keep talking lovingly and then she reaches out and pulls herself on to me. I must touch her to keep her from falling and only do it gently and with intent to support her own movements, never as a holding or a restriction. I am very happy she lets me do this. Then she sees another baby, a newborn, laying on the chair near me. It too looks oddly deformed, sharp, pointed head, elfin ears. She wants to touch the baby. I help her move over there, at one point needing to pick her up and adjust her position so she can get where she obviously wants to go. I apologize to her encouragingly so she knows I'm only doing what she will permit. Then she opens her mouth and tries to swallow the baby's head, out of curiosity, only now it's not a baby but some tiny toy yellow plastic shoes like for a doll. I am a bit concerned she'll swallow them and get hur, but she's all right. Then Ginny is seated to my right and she says, \"I can't ever hear your American Woman play without only hearing you. I laugh and say, \"I understand. Mirabelle can't either. Both of you know me so well you can't hear the universality of it.\" She agrees. I laugh suddenly as I am now aware that there are a number of cute fuzzy cats with beautiful eyes all looking right at me as I am speaking. I say to Ginny, \"Oh, this is so great. Look, there are...\" and I count up to thirteen, then add fourteen so it won't be an unlucky number. I repeat, \"There are fourteen cats staring at me right now.\" I laugh richly at the beauty and fun of it."

I sit down on the foam, wet sack, and try to stroke him to help calm him. I haven't a clue what part I'm touching, maybe below the break where he can't feel it, or up on his chest. I soothe him and tousle his hair a bit as he wiggles and squirms around, groaning. He lightly kisses me back, near my breasts, and is trying to acknowledge my presence. It is hard for him. I am wearing a pair of shorts, dark blue, and a summer blouse. Sometimes I am naked. It is semi-sexy and very intimate, but the purpose is to assist him through this bad time. He tries to put more warm water into the sack he's in and I feel the coolness leave the sack and it is warm. Then he unplugs his catheter bag down by his feet, which is plugged into the tub drain."

I touch his face affectionately. Now we are interrupted by two young people, his friends. The scraggly teen boy makes sign language gestures. They are telling him it's time to go.

I am talking to Ellie and I suddenly remember that I have a pretty white cat with cocoa brown ears in a cage upstairs and I haven't remembered her for weeks. Perhaps she has died for lack of food and water. I feel horrible. I say to Ellie that usually my helpers fed her, but lately I haven't needed so much help and I just forgot about feeding the cat. I feel like a murderer. I go quickly upstairs and I'm suddenly surprised to remember that my parents had remodeled this upstairs bedroom area before they moved out and left the house to me. I go into the big bedroom and I'm surprised to see how changed it is and realize I've lived in the house for months and haven't even gone up here to look. Somehow, perhaps Ellie went up and got the cat or whatever, but now she is out of her cage and seems to be fine. Maybe her legs are a bit shaky from lack of exercise and the confinement of the cage. I am grateful she is alive. My other cats, a black fuzzy one and another white one, only with light brown paws and lower legs, are all playing together. I am happy they get along so well. Now, I look around the room. It's quite large, painted off-white and there's a fireplace on one wall. I try to remember what it looked like when I was a child and I lived there, thinking my bed used to be in that corner. I turn to the right and see the bed, a double bed, and two fireplaces and a gas stove-like thing in between. There are fires burning in them and I am again surprised and upset with myself. This has been untended for months. It could have burned the house down. I wonder how it kept going so well so long and decide they are gas fireplaces. I see a control box and try to read the instructions so I can turn off the fires. I wonder if I should let them continue to burn, because it must help heat up the house. I notice the ceiling, which is not finished. There are holes between the boards. This part of the remodel apparently never got finished. I see objects on the ceiling above the bed, and lay down to see what my parents wanted to see when they were lying down. An old musket rifle, another rifle, and a strange fox hunt horn like thing are on the ceiling. \"That's weird,\" I think. Then my father comes into the room and asks if I want the air adjusted. I say, \"Sure.\" He gets a stick (pole) and reaches up to a high shelf to manipulate something. I watch so I'll know how to do it. Then I see a mirror and see my mother reflected. She is painting a picture. I turn to see where she should have been from the reflected image, which would be the wall where the fireplaces are, only she's not there. I step closer to the mirror. This is really weird. She's in there, or maybe it's a window to another room, only now it's not my mother but some man painting. I turn back to look at the room and see several more people are there. I see my mother and suddenly with horror I realize it's not her, nor is that man my father. Aliens are there in human form. They start to surround me. I see a younger man coming closer. A woman is in front of me and they say, \"Your face is changed too.\" I now have a hand mirror and see with horror it is not my face. The lips are pointed, like Patricia's. I'd rather have my own face back. I liked it better. I strike the approaching woman with the hand mirror across her face and this hurts her. She stumbles back. The man approaches and I hit him. I realize I can hurt them and in the confusion I run for the stairs. I managed to get to the living room, with the man right behind me. He nearly has me and I keep hitting him with the mirror, using the handle to poke him in the groin as well. I dash outside to the street, cross the street, still hitting at the man and screaming, \"Help, help.\" Finally a bunch of cars and pickup trucks stop and people are getting out to help me. The man runs away. I realize I can't tell them the truth about what happened. They'll think I'm crazy and put me away. I also realize it's going to take some getting used to being this other person, with this other face. I wake up, hearing that cry for help, \"Help, help,\" still echoing in my mind."

It isn't my fight, but I am curious about the black feathers tied to the reins of a black horse. I recognize them and wonder if they belong to an Indian I know. I decide to steal the pony and leave the dangerous fighting area. An Indian, my friend, is mad at me for abandoning them there. I ride away and look out over the vista, miles and miles of,  and I look forward to a long hard ride to another mesa where a town is. It's exploring time, vacation. I ride hard and long. As I approach the town, I get a phone call from Archie. He is upset with me and wants to talk, but he won't come to the point. I get off the horse and walk with him into the Parks and Rec building where we've danced contact improv before. He is near tears, very intensely upset and emotional. I am calm and caring and also wanting him to say what he really thinks. I am also a bit smiling because I think he won't admit that he, as the director, is upset because we are branching out on our own. He says, \"I've heard that some dancers are \"_____\" and uses a word, a special dance term, that means \"moving the move\" in contact improv language. I smile and say, \"And what's so wrong?\" He won't really say. I never help him out by saying, \"Yes, we've decided to try some dancing on our own, but that doesn't mean we are betraying you.\" It feels like he feels betrayed and abandoned. He walks a circle around me and around me as he talks. The carpet is uneven and makes it hard for me to keep my balance. Some people come in and interrupt, so I say, \"Let's go into the next room.\" We do; it has a gym floor. I am relieved and say so. I can keep on my feet more steadily that way. Now we're semi-reclining on a couch. I have my hand sympathetically on his arm. He talks around the issue, but I wait for him to say, \"I feel hurt and betrayed and I love you and you went off without me and I'm the director and you shouldn't do that to me.\" He then says he's been thinking of cutting Emery and Bonnie off soon anyway. I know that's just a defensive move and try to gently argue with him that that's not fair."

She shrugs and says she's too busy with making this doll for her daughter. The man looks at the Raggedy Ann doll and sees it is well made and says, \"How did you make that?\" She says, as she struggles to put the good one up on the window with sticky stuff on the forehead, \"I just saw the pattern and then made it.\" The man is impressed with her skill, but the woman isn't even focusing and doesn't realize she has any talent."

I explain that Howard had been there so long that I'd gotten used to sleeping up on the shelf. It was better that way than be with Howard. I realize that I'd rather be in the bed even though this strange man is there and start to get off the shelf to go to bed. We'll just have to work out our relationship with each other after I get there."

I am furious and tell him off and spin on my heel to leave. He says, \"No, please. Stay and talk with me.\" I laugh angrily and walk out. I want to walk off my anger by going as fast as I can up the staircase until I have gone as far and as high as I can go in this stone palace. I walk and walk until there is a huge stone wall or boulder stopping me. I peek in a crevasse or crack and can't see anything. Then there is an earthquake and everything around me falls until I am alone on a high, thin sliver of rock left from the palace. Then the scene shifts and the earthquake didn't happen and I am on the stairs and decide to retrace my steps down. A guard finds me and he's going to show me the way out, only now he takes me to the sultan's private quarters. I am impressed. I see women and one has a baby and she lets me hold it. While I am holding it, it relaxes and takes a nap. The sultan is near and I'm not sure if it's him or not, but bow and say, \"Your highness,\" just in case. He and his wife are introduced to me. He kisses my hand and I see his fat, double-chinned face and his fat lips. He kisses me several times. He seems to like me. I go back to where the women are and return the sleeping baby and follow the guard out, only to find myself suddenly led into the harem and I realize I've been tricked. He intends to keep me forever."

I say, \"Hey, I thought we were going to a nursing home to see Aunt Marya.\" She walks by, a very old woman, and I feel embarrassed she heard me because she obviously doesn't need a nursing home. I've insulted her. Someone says, \"Let's play ice hockey.\" \"Right!\" I say. \"So is the ice rink wheelchair accessible?\" I was sarcastic. Now I see Aunt Millie and Lydia. I am very excited and happy to see Aunt Millie. We all now have on ice skates. Aunt Millie is on my left and Lydia on my right, supporting me as I fumble and slip. We get on the ice, but the ice is really crowded with people and cafe tables and chairs. There are rectangular cuts of ice where the ice is chips and there is water under it. I must avoid all these obstacles. In addition, at the far right end is a heated swimming pool, and it's hard to avoid sliding right into it. But I manage and now I'm skating alone and Millie and Lydia are seated watching me as I come around. They smile and applaud. I feel quite accomplished now and gather up speed. More rectangular cuts are made and the ice is incredibly chopped up, and yet I continue to skate well."

Now it is time to leave, and at the last minute I decide to clean up some mess I've left -- paper scraps, some tiny knitted or crocheted stocking hats, tiny yarn doll bodies and so on.

I decide I will visit him, since on the paper is a sort of puzzle where when you read the words he asks me to visit his home. But I can't figure out where it is, somewhere in Washington. Later, Loren won't talk to me as he's mad because he doesn't like the property. I am about to leave and he calls me over to smile and say it's not your fault I had different expectations. I thank him for telling me that. I feel relieved of my guilt. The scene shifts and I've built a beautiful home on the property, which has a river on it. My bedroom is partly submerged in the river, built with Plexiglas corner so I can see the river life underneath. I wake up, afraid for a moment because some huge-eyed thing is staring at me through the glass. After my fright, I appreciate the beauty of this view. John is in the other room and somehow I know we are a mere ten miles from a big city, even though I am out there in the boondocks."

My desk area is in the far back of the room, to the left as I walk in the door and all his stuff is to the right of the door. But the door opens to the side of the room, so as I sit at my desk and see him at his, facing me at the other end of the room, the door is on my right. He says to me in a jeering tone that he has his ways and if I can't handle being around it, then I need to leave. I smile and say calmly, \"No problem.\" He hires me, now very curious about my calm and content demeanor. I do not disapprove of him or put him down, even though I don't believe what he is doing is right, but it is his life and I make no thought or attempt to try and change him. He feels that and is intrigued. I come to work the next day and clean my desk area. It is spotless, organized and ready for work in strong contrast to his area of cluttered furniture and so on. I sit, ready to work. He now wants to reform his ways and is falling in love with me and must earn my respect. I see two ugly rugs on his floor. He says, \"I want new rugs. Go buy me some.\" I laugh and say, \"Sure. What colors do you like?\" He says patterns or designs. I write this down with a marker pen on an old rug piece tacked to the wall. He loves this because it is so unconventional. He says, \"Maybe dandelions.\" I say, \"Cute and fuzzy, or botanical?\" He loves the way I banter matter-of- factly with him, not arguing or persuading him to anything I might prefer. I then go walking out to find the store. I come to the \"main street\" of the university area. A slick brick pattern is in the raised center of the road. I start to haul myself over the four-foot high raised area, throwing one leg over and scrambling, then I think, \"This isn't going to work,\" and walk an extra block out of my way to the stairs over it. I go into the store. It is a huge area with many cubicles or desks where beautiful merchandise sits. People go sit at the desk/cubicle and admire different pieces as they decide to buy or not, lots of people. I see some exquisite glass vases and realize this is an auction or estate sale of very expensive material. I go to the back of the room to ask a clerk where are the carpets. He points off to a central area where I see bits of color. I then am distracted by other fine things to see. I decide I'll go see the carpets later. I brush against a cello case and it nearly falls. I catch it and put it back. Then I see what looks like tall, thin, fine, dark wood cabinets. I go to look, touching one that tumbles against the others, almost causing a chain reaction. The once thin case opens, as is a bass fiddle case. I get it all put back and am attracted to a revolving set of walls which have pillows hanging on them. I look and then move on to a table where there are books and cameras and so on. I pick up a fat book with a thick cellophane plastic cover. I see it is a working script book for a classic movie called \"My Dear ____\" (maybe wife). I am intrigued because I had chosen this movie to dissect to learn how to do a movie. The added attraction to the book is that there are special insider notes about how the \"real\" directors do it. I look at the price. $15.00 seems a lot. Then I see I got mixed up and that is the price of a book called Wizard of Oz. I then see the right price is $11.95. I decide it's worth it and take the book. Then I see a camera, a Lieka small portable. I turn it over and try to see the back. It says Polaroid. It was $132.00 dollars when new, but I can buy it for $12.00. I choose it too. Then I find an intriguing pottery piece. It is like a small compact vase to put food in like a snack tray. The beauty of it is that it unfolds so that the main vase part holds bread sticks and dip. The other petals fold out to create a trail of platters, each a different colored pottery to hold the veggies. It is adorable. I take it too. Later I take all this back to the office and show the man, who is now like Derek. He looks at the pottery piece and says, \"Well, you'll have trouble with Charla. She'll want to play with it all the time.\" I say, \"Oh well, I'll keep it anyway. I'll put it away when she comes to visit.\" He chuckles at me for getting so many things I like when sent on the mission of getting him a carpet. (which I also did get)."

He's very rich. He has a jealous sister. He buys out her upper stories part of the mansion to create a theatre. He's up in the big room when a jealous boyfriend type man comes up. Warren wants to hide, but the room is empty. A trap door opens on the ceiling and a bed comes down from the hidden sky roof room. It lands on him, unfolding like an accordion. It hides him. The man tries to drag him out and beat him up. Then as though the dream repeats the story, the bed thing comes down again and hides him, only there is a beautiful spirit woman that lives up there and Warren is in love with her and wants to join her. He resists. Then his other sister and her daughter, his niece, come to the castle to see him, I think at his request. She (the niece) is now the dream ego. I/she walks into the corridor of the castle and see a huge door roll open, like in a dungeon. I peek in to its dark depths. I make fun of the image of Warren being courted by that beautiful woman spirit. I \"see\" her coming toward him, beckoning to him. He feels unable to resist her force. Spooky, I think, \"Maybe Death is there!\" I then see a huge, dark black-robed figure of death come toward me. I feel fear and start backing up. He comes gliding right after me and grabs me by the arms. He starts forcing me back toward the other wall. Maybe there's another door there. I struggle and now he's behind me dragging me down the hall. I resist, saying to him, \"But I'm not ready yet. I'm too young.\" He laughs. He makes a joke. I poke his bony leg at the knee with a fork. Like right, that's going to help. He feels no pain. This is DEATH! He has a death grip on me and I am afraid. There is no way out; he has me."

I can't find my room. I walk down a row of desks like in school, to a wall where I thought there was a door. There is no door. I go down another hall and see doors and open one and go in, but find myself in an enclosed corridor that leads to the fun house kiddie attraction. I say, \"What the heck,\" and go for the ride, thinking when I get there I'll find the exit and go to my room. The rug is like a conveyer belt and then there's a steep set of stairs that is more like a ladder. We go down. My brother Jake is there. He introduces me to a young girl (maybe 19 years old) named Casey. \"Humm,\" I think, \"maybe his new girlfriend.\" We arrive at the place, but it's a big auditorium where a comedy writing contest is going on and being judged. One of my scripts is in the contest. A woman is tired and wants to go to her room because the conference starts again early tomorrow. Dwight is around, but he looks like Rock Hudson and I say, \"We can go to town and sightsee later.\" He says he doesn't really want to go; the conference is too important to waste time on that. I still want to go, later. I convince the woman to wait for the results of the contest, by saying most earnestly that if we leave, we'd only have to make Dwight bring us back really early in the morning and that wastes more time. Now the judge comes over with his sheaf of papers. A man who runs the place is crazy for me and is bothering me by insisting we get together. I keep kindly but firmly repulsing him. He is a driven guy who won't accept no. He tries to hug me and pull me away and talks to get my attention. \"What is it you want?\" he asks. I say, \"I want to get the results (the range of points from the different judges) so I can figure out what I did wrong and get better with my writing.\" The judge says, \"You did pretty well, really.\" I'm sort of a runner up. I try to write down the scores, losing the page and searching for it again. I can't find them and the man says, \"Here's the code on this page. You look for this symbol and it tells you what page.\" I try again. As I am looking, he walks across the gym floor, bossing his employees around arrogantly. I smile at him, because even though he is obnoxious, there is something endearing about his single-minded love for me. He comes back and tries to convince me to go to his room. I laugh and say, \"No, but I will give you a kiss, like a ceremony to knight you, because I can see that somewhere under all that brashness is a real human being. You have to learn to let him out so we can enjoy him.\" He's all over me, taking advantage and I laugh, pushing him away and say, \"Oh, beknighted one, arise and be a knight.\""

This sounds high to me, and the place isn't all that good a shape. but now she shows us it has a living room, a dining room and several more bedrooms. It is looking more like a good deal. The bed in the back bedroom is a narrow cot like thing. I test it and it turns out to be a flimsy hammock cloth. I ask if it is a hammock. She says no, that's not the bed. The bed would be brought in later and we'd have to sign a paper saying they removed the critters. It was some kind of an insurance scam. I don't feel good about it. She then hands me a brochure on the cheap computer they offer for sale. $13.95 and it does recipes and appointments and so on. I saw some strange contrivance in the bedroom that looked like a bathroom scale taped to a woodstove chimney that was that device. I look out the back windows to check out the neighborhood. Odd looking people, fat like a cow (and looked at first like he had an udder) and so on. We're not sure this is going to be good, but we are still interesting in finding out more."

Then he maneuvers around until he is seated on my lap and turns around to nibble sexily on my neck. It is all very enticing, but I try to ignore him and go on. He follows me. I enter the large room where the animals exhibit is. If you stand at one of three stations and the animal likes you, it will come over so you can pet it. I go and stand at one station (in the middle). There is a very cute penguin there. He likes me and cuddles and does cute tricks. I look up at the large staged area and see very large gorilla type of animals, some of which have male human-like heads. They look scary and intimidating. As I watch, I realize they are escaping and coming out towards us to cause us harm. I begin to move rapidly toward the exit. Ginny and I and the young man run downstairs and out the door. The man is insistent in his love for me. Ginny goes to a car and I follow her. She says, \"I want to get away alone for a while. I'm going to take off and I'll see you later.\" I sort of realize she is giving me and the man time to be alone together. She goes and now the man and I have spent a day or two as lovers. But I am married and on Tuesday I leave to go home. He is desperate to keep me. He follows me and says, \"I hate Tuesday. I hate Monday because it is next to Tuesday. Please don't leave me.\" I am very attracted to him, but insist I must go. He is much younger than I, and I have my family to return to and I can't really believe this is a good thing to do because of our age difference. He tries and tries to convince me his love is real and forever, not a youthful whim or a passing fancy or lust. I don't let myself trust that and resist. In despair he walks away from me back into the animal exhibit building. I realize he is in bad danger and I rush in to distract and I yell something which alerts him. I had put myself in danger to save him. I turn and run out, and he escapes and runs out. Again he renews his pleas. I still say no. I am walking down the road and see a pile on beautiful conch. I pick one up and want more and then see pottery plates and bowls and realize a Native American person is selling their wares here. The man follows me. He says to me, \"OK, if tell you I am rich, will that convince you to stay?\" I say, \"No, it wouldn't.\" I walk away. The man says with intense emotion to the Native American man, \"Oh, I so want a Porsche to stop and pick me up.\" He means that I am driving a Porsche and he wants me to come back and accept him. The Native American man looks at me and says to the man, \"I can't see what you see in her, but if that's what you want, then fine.\" Now he goes up a high cliff at the ocean's edge. I climb up to follow him, fearing he will jump or something, but as I reach him and he hugs me, I am the one that falls. He rushes down to where I lay, encircled with barbed wire that is black. I have been injured. He calls the medics and the doctor says, \"She'll be wrinkled and weaker or something but she'll be OK.\" The doctor suggests we call the police. While we wait for the police to arrive, I ask him what the doctor said. He says, \"The doctor says you'll be wrinkled and this and that, but I don't care. I still love you and always will.\" Now it is Tuesday and he's crying and begging me that his life will be empty and sad if I leave him. I feel tremendous push-pull, but still can't quite believe or trust he is authentic and sure. This will all pass for him soon. I leave, but I go home and divorce my husband, realizing that I don't love him. Months pass and I must try and reach him. He had given me his phone and address and every conceivable number he could be reached at. (NOTE: At this point, I think I wake up and finish the dream awake.) I go to his rich parents' large home and ask for him. He isn't there, but has an apartment in the city. The father sees me and realizes I'm the woman who his son loves and wants and says things like, \"Whatever will make my son be happy and alive again, I want him to have.\" I go to the apartment to find him. He is with a young woman his age. I am carrying a stuffed monkey with a heart in his hands. I leave it at the door and don't even knock, but the man somehow senses me and opens the door just as the elevator door across the hall is shutting. He yells at me, \"No, come back, please.\" He runs down the stairs and is there when the elevator door opens. He begs me to return. The girl means nothing. He was trying to get on with his life without me, but it wasn't working. He would give anything to just pick me up and take me to the apartment and hold on to me forever, but he knows I must come because I want to. He says, \"If only you could come knock on the door and say to me, 'My dearest one, I love you and want to marry you forever.'\" He walks away from me, leaving me to decide. He returns to the apartment. I then go up, knock on the door and say that sentence. We hug and live happily ever after."

            "content": "I come to a family reunion. I am in a hotel room and I get up. The two young girls are playing very noisily so I can't sleep. I am looking for my hair and tooth brush but I realize I haven't packed them. How annoying. Well, I'll borrow my mother's. I see a pile of books I did pack. There's a Georgette Heyer book and many others some from my youth. I want to curl up and read them all, but there is no time. I will never have time to just read them, all the ones I like. Oh well. Now I go into the bathroom where the two girls are playing, being noisy and using other people's stuff. I tell them to stop it and find something to brush my teeth with. Now I return to my room and see the maid is there making up my bed, putting new sheets on it. She's a slovenly dressed, plump lady who sort of lays down as he works. I notice she has waxed the floor and it is slippery and there are thick iodine red or that Benodine stuff they use at the hospital, red puddles on the floor. I slip and slide my way precariously out the door. Now I have to get down the very steep (like a ladder) stairs without slipping and falling. I hold on hard to the wood post on the banister and carefully walk down. Then I start going faster and start skipping steps, and finally at the end step on a couch and hop over some things and jump the last flight of stairs and land unhurt on the ground floor. I see someone, a woman, watching me and I see I left some slipper marks on a step or two and the back of the couch. I am kind of surprised I didn't hurt myself on that last jump. So now I get to the room where the reunion is happening. I see Patricia and her husband Morton, and music is playing and people are in Halloween costumes except me. I didn't choose to wear a costume. Now I am dancing with Patricia's husband and I don't know the steps because it is a country dance, but he wraps his legs strongly with mine and I follow his lead very well. At the end of the dance he is surprised when I say I've never danced this kind of dance before. He is impressed. I go to find the relatives I like. As I walk through the room, I see Grandma Mildred there and am surprised because she's been dead for years. She looks years younger and rejuvenated. She is still an older woman, but she has cleavage and somewhat pretty breasts, long pretty hair and is in a sexy white negligee gown thing. Millie comes over and says, \"Hey, I only want to talk to the ones I find interesting or that I like,\" meaning her mom and me. My mother is nearby, watching. Grandma is chatting and Millie wants to talk real and important things. I wander off and a band is being set up to entertain us and I say to the organizing woman, \"Let me do a few things while the band is setting up.\" She at first is reluctant because usually my stuff has been boring or repetitive. I tell her, \"I won't do the old stuff, like Evangeline; I'll do a new comedy routine and a dance number I learned.\" She hesitates, but since I agreed to do it while the band is setting up, it's OK, so I go out into the center of the room. The benches (like church pews) are placed in a theatre in the round style, but some of the benches face away from me. I start talking a comedy routine and at first it's pretty deadly quiet in terms of laughs. As I continue and build, they start becoming more interested and laughing until I have their attention and they enjoy my routine, which is improv and just me talking. Now I am going to dance and I call for my partner. Now the point of view shifts and I am in the audience watching this beautiful flighty woman and her partner dance. I am sitting on the floor in the gentle arms of some man. Now the male dance partner comes over and comedically opens his cape to reveal boxer shorts over tights. He wiggles his hips and the shorts fall down around his ankles, only there's another pair there and he repeats this two more times. The man I'm with gets a bit worried as this is a family audience and the children are there. Then the male dancer grabs his crotch and makes an obscene gesture. I am uncomfortable, but hoping everyone sees it's for comedic effect. Now the woman dancer with wonderful, curly long hair begins to dance and she steps on the back of a bench and twirls and dances around the room."

I see a few things I would be willing to eat and from lack of interest, we all decide to keep, or rather a decision is never actually made. We just didn't do anything about it. I am looking for the chicken nuggets, but the pretty woman ate them. She is wearing a beige, lacy, sexy dress and I wonder if the overdress is mine, but it's just her shawl. She is like Jessica Lange in \"Blue Sky,\" very sexy. She is wondering where the costume department is. She goes off looking and I try to pack up the food stuff and my shoes and this and that. Then, John (a fellow teacher) is a black man and he is doing funny impersonations. He's doing one where he must walk backwards in front of a person (also a black man) who is walking toward him and as he does this, he is talking like he is threatening this person, like he has the power. This is very funny and he says it only is funny when he walks backwards at the same time he is trying to sound threatening. Then the black man asks him to do another impersonation. He does a famous important man, maybe Martin Luther King. He is very good and he is also still walking backwards as they go into the Theatre Department building. Now I go into a classroom and John is there, only now he looks like Robert Young, in \"The Second Woman,\" about a man who might be paranoid and dangerous, but the woman loves him. A black man comes in and John and he are having an argument that is at an impasse. John teaches class on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 1:00 to 2:30 and the \"Makeup Man\" wants that room at that time. Neither is willing to budge. I take the role of fascinator or mediator. I write on a blackboard the headings \"Makeup Man\" in a purple/pink chalk, and on the right side of the board, I write \"Instructor.\" We are going to list all the objections until we can come to some compromise. I notice the Instructor space is larger and more convenient to get to and say, \"Oh, oh. I am not being fair. I'm already biased.\" I go to another board and try to make it equal."

Just then, as I am up and grabbing a towel to clean up the mess, I notice the front door is slowly opening. I go to the door, afraid and try to close it, but two teen boys, one very blonde and has mild CP, are in the room and I know they intend to rape or hurt me. I say, \"No, no, no,\" in an inept way and open the door for them to go out. I try to insist, but they laugh and I manage to get them out and shut the door and lock it. I know they are going around to the back door. I go to the phone and dial the whole number for the police department and wonder why I didn't just dial 911.

I am not sure if it is merely an animal crocodile, or if it is an intelligent life form. It crawls out on land and signs in as Captain Morg. I stay in my shallow area afraid to go out into the larger pool. Now a car drives out onto the water, does a turn and drives back. These people aren't afraid.

The jacket is open. I am walking down the stairs and kids look at me. I close the jacket. I go around the corner and find the line for Santa. Howard comes back up after the Santa thing. I need some glasses and he offers his to me. I laugh, saying, \"I'll try but I won't be able to see anything,\" since his prescription is worse than mine. I look at them before I put them on and am surprised to see they are one huge lens, not two. I put them on and can see just fine. I tell him I like his better, because mine are trifocals and hard to see out of. A man watches, friendly like."

I go into another room where Deirdre, my cousin is. I ask to borrow some clothes. I choose some pink sweater and a skirt.

I wonder why I chose such a low class (middle class) place to go to. I feel a bit embarrassed and ashamed I have to do this. I see the name of the hotel on the porch. Something Bachelor Beau____. I look again trying to commit the name to memory. The word \"sin\" is there followed by a goose and a gander, wooden carved thing. I chuckle at the reference to the sexes. I enter the main living room. I see several older gray-haired gentlemen and my heart sinks. A blind man, more my age, says to me cynically, \"Are you here to get a rich husband?\" I say, \"No I am not.\" A door opens and several other men come in, one couple obviously gay. They are dressed in modern clothes. I am in a full length satin Victorian dress. I think to myself, \"I would like this to be Victorian and I don't want the gay couple there.\" I am taken upstairs by a plumb maid. I don't want to be here. Now one of my sisters is here. We are both trying to get a husband, only we kept this secret from each other and both choose to be at this hotel. She is annoyed to find me there. We are to go down to dinner. We barely speak. At the dinner table is a sinister, black-haired typical villain of romance novels. He wants me. I despise him. He sits next to Lydia at the opposite end of the table. I now leave the dinner and go out for a stroll. He follows me and presses his suit. I am repelled and faint. He picks me up and carries me back to the hotel. My hero, William Shattner, is coming up the drive and sees me being carried by the villain. He, William, says, \"What's this?\" I am taken into a room to be examined by a doctor, but my spirit stays in the waiting/living room seated on a couch with the villain seated on my right. William gets on bended knee and is trying to hold my hand. I try to resist, but tenderly keep my hand in his. He leans forward to kiss me. I permit it without returning the kiss and then my feelings overtake me and I kiss him. He now knows I love him. I say to him, \"I (meaning the sleeping me in the other room) won't remember this.\" William says, \"But I will,\" meaning he will continue to pursue me, knowing now there is a chance.

I look past him and see a huge river with lots of people playing and swimming. He asks me to describe the scene to him. I tell him it is a pleasant Sunday afternoon where people are all out to enjoy the wonderful weather and have fun. I tell him about four fat men who each stand ten feet apart and at a signal all fall in backwards into the river; the kids swimming and playing. A sled that looks like a snow sleigh goes by, with red painted trim. I describe that. A convertible car with no engine or hood in the front goes by, crawling over the couches near the bank. The driver is concerned that water is splashing into the empty place where the engine would be. He wants his spiffy car to stay spiffy. I say to him, \"I'm sorry,\" thinking I helped splash some water. Then I say to Mark, \"I'm always telling people I'm sorry.\" Mark and I are getting physically closer, our arms brushing each other. It is gentle and loving and shy. We are very attracted to each other. Mark tells me of his house, which is his but it's his mother's and his family is very important to him. Then I notice the river level is dropping. All of a sudden, the entire water contents of the river drain away and everyone falls to the bottom, including us. A man tells us that the water will be gone for one or two hours. I look up and see the man on a high balcony by a metal railing. The sun is warm and bright. I am looking up at him but aware I am shyly avoiding looking into Mark's eyes. I have Mark, a quad, folded up in my arms and I stand up and start walking, carrying him. The way is rough, stones, debris and boulders. It makes walking hard, but I am managing well. I get back up near the house and Mark says, \"My brother left a taped message in your van for you.\" I laugh and say, \"Then let's go hear it.\" We go back toward the van."

I'll take them if you can convince me they will be helpful.\" The woman tries to think of a way they can be helpful and says they would make paper sounds when opened and this may scare the cattle into moving, or scare away predators. I am not convinced. I ride out of the house to catch up with the man on the cattle drive."

Then a man friend named Richard comes over. He is heartbroken. He's in love with a woman who won't have him. I am supportive. Richard goes to see his Doctor and I go with him. It is 3:00 am and as Richard talks to the good-looking doctor (like Deepak Chopra in looks), people come to the door, one at a time and hand him handwritten notes. He pauses, reads them, smiles appreciatively at them and continues with Richard. One of those people is a young, frail teenage runaway girl. She has a crush on him. He is gentle with her. The doctor now asks me out for a dinner date. I smile and say yes. I like him and he likes me. The next night I come to his office. I am dressed in a sexy black dress. I am young and good-looking with a trim, firm figure, and I am wearing a coat, like a trench coat, over it. I want to dazzle him later with the surprise of how nice I look. He says, \"The car is over here.\" I look and see a tiny black sports car. It is very spiffy, but as we get to it, it is filled with rusty brown water. The top is down and perhaps it rained. I don't really care one way or the other. He is watching for my reaction. Then he says he has another car and opens a garage-like door. It is up a few feet (maybe 4 or 5 feet) from the ground level and covered with a car protection tarp. He unties the tarp and removes it and the car goes backwards like down a ramp and stops next to me. It is a plain brown station wagon. I cheerfully open the passenger side door and see three plants with red flowers on the floor on the passenger side and some cardboard boxes. While I am chatting with the doctor, I move the cardboard boxes to the back seat, asking his permission first, to clear a space for me to sit. He seems pleased that I take all this in pleasant nonchalance. Now he's driving and I am seated to his right and slowly we inch closer together. I'm still in my coat. Now we are close. I say, \"I used to live in cities but I don't like cities. I love small towns.\" He agrees. He loves small towns also. He says, \"There's hardly any more places left on earth that don't have a road coming to them.\" I turn my face toward him and his face is so close, I kiss his cheek tenderly. He smiles lovingly. We arrive somewhere and discover that my friend Richard has been arrested by some military man. Richard had fallen madly in love with another woman who is no good for him. I want to rescue Richard, so I approach the military officer and take my coat off slowly. The doctor is behind me so as I slowly drop my coat, the military man sees the front and the doctor sees the back. They are both mesmerized by my beauty. I have sufficiently distracted the military man and Richard runs for the small row boat. The doctor and I follow and the three of us shove out into this huge lake. I notice the tip of a brown creature's nose peeking out of the waves and feel a second of concern that it is a monster. We continue on. It is a bit difficult as the small boat bobbles in the waves."

I see the raft the boy made. It is a single log, tied at both ends with rope and the two other ends of the ropes are tied together at a docking like of thing. This makes a triangular shape of the log and the ropes. He yells at me angrily, \"No girl can touch my boat.\" He comes for me. He dives into the murky water and I use the log as a pole to keep him from me, and then as he bites my toe, attempting to bite it off, I use the pole to beat at him, trying to kill him before he gets me. I am afraid. He's got me and is gnawing through my toe. The pain is excruciating. I am screaming, \"Help, Help!\" to get the police to know this is where I am. Then I scream V, so they know it's me, the one who made the emergency 911 call. I wake up."

I also feel a bit sad or jealous it is her and not me. She says quietly, \"No, I don't give refunds.\" I am a bit annoyed, but still want us to be on friendly terms. I say, \"Are you saying this happens to all the dresses like this? Because if it only happened to mine, then I have a defective dress and should be refunded. If it is all the dresses, then you sell defective merchandise and I should be refunded. Maybe I'll go find a lawyer and talk to him about my rights.\" She agrees to refund me."

Richard, the big man, is the investigator and I am helping. The airline representative keeps coming in to Richard and saying, \"The airline says they will give you _____\" and Richard laughs and says, \"Not good enough.\" While we wait for her to return, Richard and I playfully tease each other and talk. I tell him how my hair is all ruined now because I accidentally cut the bangs funny. Now I can't sing the blues right. He creates a poster that basically says that I am psychologically injured over my appearance being ruined. I think that's a bit much, but I seriously tell him how people think this is just a small thing, but it is really affecting my life in a big way. Richard is empathetic. We are annoyed that the airlines has put us in the very back room, behind the gymnasium, and there's even open doorways that lead out to other rooms where they are rented out for weddings. I see some bridesmaids lined up in the hall. So Richard and I go out for a walk and get outside. We lie down on the sidewalk near the grass. We're sort of in a wagon. I am holding a newborn baby. She is really cute and I enjoy her. But Richard is starting to want to get close and amorous. He puts her down by my feet in a small corner. I look to make sure she can still breathe there. She is fine. Then a man comes over, obviously an old friend of Richard's. He hugs Richard and kisses him and Richard laughs and says, \"Hey, don't. She'll get the wrong idea.\" The man is pretending to be amorphous to tease Richard. I look at his hair. It's a bit messy, graying and balding, but he sure could sing the blues. I am impressed and he walks away singing the blues. Now I have the sweet baby girl in my arms and I am driving my wheelchair around the lawn, avoiding running over people laying on the grass and enjoying the ride with the baby."

I do see a place behind us that has music and big klieg lights. I figure that must be the place. We walk back to that place and see several circles of people dancing in bright and colorful costumes, but no turkeys. Now we go up some stairs into a building and find children in a circle to do the kid turkey roundup. We see the kids trying to catch baby turkeys. Charla goes into the circle. I see a turkey chick (which looks pretty much like an eagle or owl) on the back shoulder of a boy. Now Charla has her turkey and we decide to head back home, only now we are flying in a plastic laundry basket. We are looking at this new city called Yamhill which is all manmade. Patricia is saying that it is a shame that underneath all this beauty and modern convenience are debris and decay. Hidden beneath the pretty buildings and the manmade lakes are piles of rubbish. I nearly fall out of the basket several times as we fly over the city."

I am in my nightie, so I hope the front room curtains are pulled. Then it looks like they aren't; I rush up to close them. And I see it was an optical illusion, they really were closed. Now I turn on the TV again to continue watching the show about the fat, disabled man. He moves with grace, the blubber on him sort of bouncing and flowing around him. Someone thinks or the narrator says that it is kind of fascinating to watch. You gain some measure of respect or empathy when you get to know him. Now Ernie comes in from outside, he and Ricardo. He is surprised to see me up at 4:00 in the morning. I tell him I couldn't sleep so I got up for awhile. He asks how I'm doing on the dictionary. I say I'm still writing. He asks me why. I say because it's a way of talking out-loud to myself to hear what I'm thinking. Then I realize he said dictionary. I say, \"Oh, I thought you meant journal.\" I then say, \"The reason I'm still working on the dictionary is that I am a poor speller. It's just a disability I have. I have to check each word's spelling, the endings and if it's in the right nook.\" Ernie is a bit disdainful; that it takes me so long. He mentions he had a couple of accidents and hurt himself. He then had a quick vision. He said three things, one of which was an eagle and a feather. I am impressed with this powerful vision. I know he will look down on me for this, but I say, \"It is similar to a dream, isn't it?\" Ernie shrugs his shoulders and says nonchalantly, \"Of course, you'd try and find meaning in it. It's just that in my family people die of this and it got me to thinking.\" I say, sympathetically, \"Ah, well, in my family they die of stomach cancer. We each have our thing to die with.\" Ernie then wants to know if I can sleep single, meaning can I join a person on the couch hide-a-bed. He is concerned for me and wants me to get my sleep. I say, \"No thanks. I'll stay up awhile and then go back to my bed upstairs.\" He asks again, a different way. I decline. He shrugs and says good night."

I see a deli counter, sort of a Safeway Bakery. I find a bag of rolls or muffins and decide to get one. I read the ingredients to make sure there is no sugar in them. I continue strolling. As I walk, I nearly step on the end row boat of a string of boats. It is a rowing team. Justin, Lucy's husband, is learning to row and is lying down on his back in the last boat (like it's a train of them). I smile and apologize for nearly stepping on him. I think I embarrassed him and feel bad about that. I choose a sweater to buy. I put it on and notice it is quite huge, longer than my dress. I see Delores M and she has a sweater like it. It is pink knit, half sleeves. I notice I can see my dress underneath the sweater. Delores is telling me how she fought with the telephone company over a one thousand dollar bill and they agreed to remove 300 dollars of it. She was quite proud of that. I congratulate her. I say to Delores, \"It looks like I'd better always wear a dress under this thing. After all, my boyfriend is disabled, but he's not blind.\" A group of young women burst out laughing at my amusing joke. I grin and stroll on. I still have to pee, so as I am walking, I pee down my leg. I am a bit embarrassed about the urine smell and being in public. I sit at a cafe table and three men join me; I continue peeing, hoping they don't notice."

These slats then create a ladder. I walk up, pulling myself up the ladder. Now I am in a dangerous part where there are poisonous jungle snakes. I pull out a large knife. I see black shiny snakes coming out from under cups and dishes and statues on a shelf. I have to climb up on that shelf to go to the next level. A center statue is in the way and I decide I don't want that one anyway and choose another and then another. Someone says or I think, \"Do they need an Elvis statue to get on with it?\" Six snakes come out and I chop off their heads simultaneously. They are very beautiful with vibrant colors, turquoise and so on. Now I get to the next section. Each section is different. This one has people who are very aggressive and belligerent. I must out-bluster them to survive. I do so, easily. I have arrived. Now it is time to go back. I hold a sleeping bag-like thing and am zipping up the end, while it is still rolled up, making a spiral path for the zipper. Somehow this means I've discovered a faster, safer way through without taking those dangerous paths. But now a very noisy, aggressive boy whirls toward me. He wants my attention. He wants to go with me. A woman chuckles and said she found him at the site (setting) called Cathedral and his name is Daniel O'Flannery. We laugh at the irony of an obvious Irish Catholic boy being from a setting called the Cathedral. The boy has red hair and freckles and is cute and wholesome-looking. I tell him to leave me alone. His demanding, attention-getting behavior won't work with me. I then decide to go back through the paths. He follows me. I at first am concerned he'll be harmed, but then he asked for it. I warned him. So I decide this will be a lesson for him and go on, being aggressive and belligerent to the dangerous people on this path, in order to safely get through. I realize from his distant yelling he's scared and will get hurt. I call down the spiral to him, \"Just be your fierce, aggressive self on this section. It will work for you.\" He does it and catches up to me. I turn to him and say, \"This next section is the opposite. You have to be clever and quiet.\" He tries to do so.

The last booth opens up, they each have flowered curtains for doors. I go in and it's a white, tall plastic kitchen trash can under a counter. I squinch under the counter and sit and begin to pee. My bladder is very full. I hesitate and then I tell myself quite realistically, \"I am awake, it's OK to pee.\" I pee and pee, trying not to slop any out of the round container. Finally I am done, but I feel uncomfortable, like I still need to pee and that maybe it wasn't OK to pee, maybe I wasn't awake. A woman is talking to me very friendly and we are chatting.

The large man had said something to me on the way back in about how they had managed to take Polly with them, meaning they had poisoned her on the sly. I try to find the piece of paper in a sheaf of them in my hand to prove what they said, because I didn't really catch it all and was unsure if they said that or not. I need to know because if it is true, I must tell Polly. I can't find it. Finally the large man says it's all right. We didn't poison Polly."

I start to dig into all my old purses, which apparently my mother packed too, because, as I explain to some woman, I often don't clean out my old purses and I am used to carrying spare pills just in case, but no luck. I find a few pills, which when I look closely, are merely vitamin like things, round and yellow. I sigh. I need to call my doctor and have him prescribe a temporary supply of pills for three days, which is how long I'm going to visit here. I can't remember how to use the phone. My mother tells me to push the save tab on a card index file. I say, \"Oh sure, I remember now. I push it and pick up a brochure and put it up to my ear like it's the receiver. I complain I can't hear very well. There are too many people talking in the room. So my father pushes me back, like I'm in a chair and he is shoving the chair with me in it until I am back in a roomy clothes closet. I can't remember the doctor's name. I remember Dr. A. and say, \"But they switched me to some other doctor, a Doctor ... Mendelsohn. I am ambivalent about which doctor to call. I finally decide on the new one since the paperwork would go more smoothly, although it would be nice to talk to Dr. An. because he knows my case. I notice I am naked and have an excessive amount of long dark brown armpit hair and pubic hair. I am a bit surprised. I've never had so much hair there before. I used to shave. I must have let it grow for a long time. I am younger, maybe in my 30's. My body is pudgy but firm and soft, a nice pretty body."

I open the door and see it is a long l-shaped room with lots of wooden chairs and desks. Some women from another department are also working in there. I look over the situation and ask the client if it is OK with her that we work in here, because having other people around could be a confidentiality problem. She reluctantly agrees. I see another room, used as a classroom, and now the women have used it as a coat room. I pull her in there. I say we may be occasionally interrupted. So we sit and she starts doing all kinds of avoidance behaviors, walking around, chatting about other things, etc. I firmly say to her, \"You have three (I was contemplating five but decided that was too long) minutes to quiet down and work or I will leave.\" She ignores me and continues but at precisely three minutes has managed to sit quietly. I start to work with her about being pregnant and she starts up again. This time I give her two minutes. She doesn't stop and I go get my coat and scarf and start to leave.

Then an idea comes to him; he could use dreams. They could do dance movements like dream scenes come to him -- energy, surprise, beauty. So he writes it and I hear the male lead dancing it. The dance area is ringed with old apartments where two or three stubborn old men have refused to move out and they insist on living there so close to the dance area that their normal living movements are distracting to the audience of the dance. So I hear the one old man asking the lead dancer as he is doing his wonderful leaps and so on, does he know a word he needs for this crossword. The dancer keeps hissing at him through his clenched teeth, \"I am dancing here!\" But the old man ignores that and keeps asking his question."

We turn and run as fast as we can back down the hill to find the creeks and rivers we had seen to jump into. We find one in the nick of time and dive in. I hold Boomer and we hold our breath until we must have oxygen and then gulp up some air and back under. It is touch and go. But finally the fire passes us, leaving charred remains and smoke, a close call. Now we decide we have to get to M City some other way. I see a dirt road and choose another one.

One wants to be as close as you can to the curb, right? I get in and very carefully pull away from the edge. Now I drive us down the steep hill and on. I say I wonder if this is the road to M City. It doesn't seem right. I see a small town, really just a cluster of buildings ahead. We'll ask directions. I get out and see a small store, but it is a ghost town and no one around. Then a car drives up. I am glad and walk over and ask the woman getting out of the passenger side if she can tell me how to get to M City. She is holding a rifle, I suddenly notice, and there are blood spots on her hands. She looks at me startled and mean. I get scared. I ask her again and she says, \"I'll tell you but first you have to come up to the house.\" Well, there's no way I'm going to do that. She'll kill me, thinking I'm a witness to something. I agree, though and get in the VW bus and drive away. Only the man that was with her is in my way on a bicycle in the road. I follow him for a short distance.

I put it on. A scarf goes with it, very 1950's in style. We leave, feeling happy."

He is looking at the many, many rows of scars from shots and blood tests. He is sorry for the pain I must endure. I feel his soft skin and like being near him. I wonder if we could forget all the pain of the past and just start over. I feel tenderness for him. He moves and the moment is over. I do not try to bring it back."

As he talks passionately about the history of E City, he walks around. Sometimes he is walking around a tiny ledge up on the wall. Another time he straightens up a photo of himself which had slipped down in its frame. He later walks on a balcony and then jumps down. Later, he walks around the l-shaped room's corner to be visible to the stretched-out, oddly-spaced audience. I change my hat and handbag. Two skinny older women in silly odd-shaped cowgirl hats pop out from the back stage area to sing a song, but they are too early. They sing one note and stop suddenly, embarrassed. I like the mayor and what he is saying. I remember some of the things he was talking about and marvel at how many years ago it was that this building or park was started."

An older woman walks with me for a while but she gives up and turns to return to her car or someplace dry. I keep on, loving the rain. Now I am walking in a lovely Swiss Alps country. I stop on the sidewalk and look around at the incredible beauty all around me: mountains, yellow Swiss houses, autumn-colored leaves on the many trees. I am in a small village. A good-looking man is in a red car in a parking lot nearby. He watches me and is entranced by my innocent appreciation of the beauty around me. I begin to walk up a very steep hillside sidewalk and he gets out of the car and follows me. It is hard to walk up this steep walkway, but I am enjoying the vigorous challenge. At the top is a huge tree, where you will not get wet. I go under the tree. The man strikes up a conversation with me and I like talking to him, but I don't really give him my full attention because everything around me is so interesting. The leaves of this tree are so thick, they make a wall. He shows me by taking my hand and rubbing it against the leaves. I am amazed. He watches me, liking the reactions I have, but wanting me to notice him. I look out a window, which is really an open square in the leaves. This tree is huge and really creates a long house. We walk on, the tree now a series of hallways with small rooms. It is a museum-like place. I peek in one room, a tiny one with a woman in it. She is conducting an experiment with magnetics or something. I am curious and go in. She tells me to lean my front against the wall. I do and the man is very close behind me. Other people come in and we are very crowded, so the man is right up against my back, pressing me into this odd feeling magnetic wall. It feels good. We go on. He asks me to join him at the Village Fair. I now realize he is interested in me and is courting me. I don't completely trust him, but we spend the afternoon at the Fair, laughing, talking, and walking around. I am attracted to him. Now it is evening. I return to where I had come from, some house or hotel. My man and another one I knew before are talking. I gather from the conversation that it was some kind of competition. The other man had dated me, so this one wanted to try and get me from him. I am deeply hurt and run from the building. The man who likes me runs after me. I run down steep hillsides, dashing around trees and I go for miles. He is in hot pursuit. I wade in a lake to cover my tracks and then swim. I am out of breath and exhausted, but keep on. I arrive at the other end of the lake and climb up a rope ladder to a second story window of my papa's house, calling out \"Papa.\" I feel the man now climbing the rope ladder too. I desperately cry out, \"NO!\" and try to shake him off. He is determined to catch me to explain how I had misinterpreted the conversation. He truly does love me. I fall into my \"mother's\" arms gasping, \"Don't let him catch me.\" The man gasps out, \"\" We had covered miles and I had kept the lead the whole way. I'd pushed myself beyond my capabilities."

I wade in and am surprised the water is so warm. Howard and I go for a wade, only it turns out not to be the ocean but a parking lot. As we walk, I tenderly touch the white shirt he is wearing. I touch the arm as a gentle way to be connected or close. It feels very nice. Now I have to go pee. We go into a public bathroom. I am surprised we are both in the same one. He says it's ok. I go to the other side of the room, still concerned about the mixed sexes in one bathroom. I pee, but the toilet is loose and wiggles around. I notice it is a galvanized metal tub I am peeing into. I wonder who will have to clean up that mess. Charla joins us and we go on with the walk. We are in a church. Howard says he'd like to go there some day. I ask what kind of church it is, and he says \"scholarship\" or something academic. Now we are walking down a street and some drunk and disorderly people are driving in a dangerous way toward us. Howard had been drinking beer and he started getting belligerent back at them. I walk away, deliberately calling him Jared, which upsets him, as I knew it would. He resented being compared with his father. He leans up to me and says, \"I'm not the only one who has faults.\" I sigh and agree. \"I know,\" I say. \"I have them too.\" Now we are seeing a counselor. We begin to talk, to try and work out our differences. I say, \"But it isn't only that. There are so many things we'd have to change.\" It is too much."

They ask if there is enough room for 20 people. I say, \"The room capacity is 135, I would think there would be enough room.\" Now I am looking at pictures in a magazine of a M City-like region with a old \"Gabby Hayes\" kind of man in the picture.

I go to the teacher doctor at the front desk and breathlessly explain my situation. I so much want to perform well so I can pass the test. He watches me with interest to see how I will handle this challenge. I see some plastic letters in a sheet. I find a blue sheet of them and a teal blue one. I now have better materials and rush to continue my work. I am now making a tiny tortilla and putting refried beans on it. I fold the tortilla and put a part of an olive on it and a scrap of lettuce. I then plop a bottle of Mexican beer by the place setting, in the manner of a person who doesn't appreciate the wife role. I feel some resentment. I then put a bottle of rose-colored wine cooler next to it, for me, and then move it to the far end of the table. I try to find a pretty china dish, but none are left and I look for any plate. Now I am done and go to the teacher doctor. He smiles at the intensity I feel and the anxiety for how I did. He says, \"Call upstairs and see if they graded you yet.\" I search for a telephone. Then I ask for the extension number, then I can't find a quarter. Then it's the wrong phone. A bemused clerk at the drugstore I'm in comes over and shows me the pay phone. It is high up on the wall. I try to put the quarter in the right slot, as there are two. I accidentally try to put in a round glass piece. I see my mistake and put in a quarter. I finally reach them upstairs and they say, \"The results are in, come on up to get them.\" I am near tears. I race to the stairs, at first crossing an odd board on the floor that tilts to slide you on down the hall, but I am on the wrong floor. I retrace my steps and find the circular stairway. I step on the first stair, which has an odd accordion expanding set of stairs that work a bit like an escalator, except I step up each step and it carries me to the next step. My borrowed white lab coat gets caught for a moment in the device. I pull it free. The clerk already knows I passed because I had been so thorough and conscientious. I am filled with dread and anticipation."

I want to help, so I go and scrape off the globs of frosting and try to frost the cake again. I take huge quantities of frosting off and put it on a cardboard. Then I look again and notice that I have really made a mess of this cake. There apparently hadn't been too much and I had put chocolate where the white was and so on. I feel embarrassed and I feel badly for Andrea who made the cake. She comes in and I feel compelled to apologize and explain my actions to her. She looks at me and then at the cake and is appalled. She turns and leaves the room. Her cake is ruined and she feels angry and miserable. I feel bad I accidentally made the mess, but I am also aware of a sense of revenge or satisfaction, which I try to minimize or deny. I see my mother seated at the front of the room. Another woman, younger, comes and sits next to her, rather close. My mother shifts her position to create more distance and then to my surprise she puts her arm along the back of the chair the other woman is seated in. She is careful to keep her distance and not actually make physical contact with the woman. I also notice that there are many square parts of the cake all along the front of the room in piles. It was a pretty big cake and tastes just fine. Nobody else seemed upset that the frosting wasn't perfect."
